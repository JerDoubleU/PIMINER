	Q.  And you are a psychologist, not a

19
	medical doctor?

20
	A.  Correct.

21
	Q.  But a big part of your practice, I take

22
	it, is actually taking care of folks who are

23
	dependent on nicotine, trying to help them get off

24
	cigarettes?

	A.  That's what I'm doing, yes.

centers in that regard?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And this is the bulk of your life's work, is it not?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you'll � if it's okay with you, I have a tendency to refer to folks with your credentials as "Doc."  I mean no disrespect.  I just � I just say that.  So if I say that, does that bother you?

A.  Not at all.

A.  Daniel F. Seidman.

Q.  Tell us what you do, please.

A.  Okay.  So when I was a young psychologist, I got asked by the department that I'm part of at Columbia to work with smokers, to run a smoking cessation clinic.

So I've done this for a very long time, and what happens is people try to quit on their own.  They're frustrated.  They're struggling. They're not doing very well.

And they may try to quit on their own, they may try to quit with a doctor.  Either a doctor refers them to me or somehow they find me, and they come in, and they � they want help to stop smoking.  That's why they're coming.

They intend to quit, but for some reason, they're not able to do it, and so they want � they want some help, and what I've found over the years �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, I think we need a question at this point.

They'll do fine, and they go on their way.

Some of them I work with for months or years, and some of those do well, and some of them unfortunately I can't help.

So I wish I could help everybody, and that's not possible, but what I found is that all smokers are not alike.

Some are like apples and some are like oranges, and when I teach the medical students and the psychology doctoral students, I talk about how it's really not the same problem for everybody.

Some people can quit relatively easily on their own.  Some people say it's the hardest thing they've ever done, and some people are not able to do it, unfortunately.

Q.  So when it comes to nicotine dependence, are there varying levels or degrees?  Are all smokers the same with regard to their dependence on nicotine?

A.  No, they're not.  It's not really the same problem, and I think part of what � what happens is if people collapse at all and they say: Well, I know somebody who quit on their own, or: I quit pretty relatively easily.  I didn't really

But you can't generalize necessarily

from your own experience because some people say

it's the hardest thing they've ever done, and they

mean it.

And some people are so frustrated that

they're in a bunker and they feel that they can't

succeed.

Q.  Is your life's work dedicated in trying to figure out ways to deal with smokers of all ilk, regardless of the severity of their dependence?

A.  Right.  Anybody who is not � is not able to quit who would come to me.  I would try to understand them, try to come up with a plan for them, and then work with them to support them, give them some hope, give them some strategies, whether they're behavioral or cognitive, and try to help them to quit as best I can with everything I know about the field.

Q.  Do you have to work with some of the intractably addicted smokers, the ones that are toughest to treat?

A.  Well, I have made that a specialty of mine, the so-called hard-core smoker or the

A.  New York State.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And can you tell the jurors, how do you evaluate a smoker, please?

A.  Okay.  So when � I've been doing this for a long time.  So when somebody comes in, I'll say to them:  Tell me � tell me why this is hard for you to quit.  What's going on?  How did you get into this, and why are you having a hard time?

And they'll start telling me what happens when they try to quit, and I'll be listening for the story.

For example, when I'm reading through the depositions for Mr. Shulman, he says that at 10:00 at night one night, he ran out of cigarettes, and he couldn't stand �

to lodge an objection or not.  We transitioned

from the general to Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Ask your next

question.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  I was asking you about how you evaluate a smoker.  You started to tell us, and then you transitioned to something about my client, Mr. Shulman.

A.  Right.

Q.  I'd like to ask you:  In your evaluation of smokers, give us an example that's applicable to Mr. Shulman, as you were saying, please.

A.  Okay.  So when they're telling you a story, you're listening for, you know, what's important, what you think is going to be important that you need to pull out of it.

And when I read the � the many, many volumes of Mr. Shulman, one thing that happened to him is that it was 10:00 at night one night; he ran out of cigarettes, and he couldn't stand it so much that he called a man who owned a pharmacy that he knew and he asked him to open the pharmacy so that he could get cigarettes.

Now that's an unusual story, in my

up in the middle of the night to smoke.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Don't interrupt.

I don't think he should interrupt him, but I understand.  I'll direct it a little more �

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Let me see the objection.

Okay.  Sustained.  The jury should disregard the last answer that the witness gave. It's stricken from the record.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  So if a man such as Mr. Shulman � A.  Yeah.

Q.  � gave you a poignant example of having such a powerful need for cigarettes that he asked someone to open up a store that was closed that he could get them, is there a correlation to that with what you began to say about waking up in the middle of the night to smoke, and why is that important when assessing the depths of the dependency to nicotine that smokers have, please?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Is there a correlation or not between asking someone to open up a store in the middle of the night to allow someone to buy cigarettes to smoke and the criteria of smoking or getting up in the middle of the night to smoke, please?

A.  I mean, it sounds like someone is desperate for a cigarette.  That's what it sounds like to me.

And so I'm making note of that, you know, or if they're getting up in the middle of the night to smoke, it's somewhat unusual to do that.  So I'm making a note of that �

Q.  So �

A.  � or if they're getting up in the morning early to smoke, I'm making a note of that.

Q.  Okay.  So now bring this back home to your methodology.  What is this about looking for the story?  You were explaining that to us, how you look for the story when you interact with a smoker, please.

A.  Well, a lot of smokers say that they want to guit, and they intend to guit, and they

happened.

Were you � were you � what was the

situation?  How � what is the ring of it?  What

does it � what does it seem like?  Why is it so

desperate for you to guit smoking?

And what's happened to your confidence,

because we know what happens to a lot of smokers

is, when they fail, they go into kind of a bunker,

and that failure makes the next guit attempt

harder.

So no matter how much they want to do

it, sometimes they just start to believe that they

can't do it and they can't live without the

cigarette.

So those are the kinds of things I'm

looking for.

Q.  So in your typical clinical setting when you have someone that is coming to you to help them with their nicotine dependence, you say your assessment is to get the story, and you explained that.

A.  Yeah.

Q.  When you assess them, is the first thing you do � or is there anything you do like to

determine whether or not they're dependent?

A.  Well, I don't do that because I'm very experienced.  So I can get the feel of it pretty quickly.

And when they start to talk to me about it, I start to understand � it all comes out.  It all comes out in the story.  I don't have to sit there with a paper-and-pencil checklist.

I mean, later, I can do that.  I can � I can score something, but I don't typically have to do that because I can tell pretty much where the problems are.

I'm listening to figure out where the problem is so when I give them a plan to address quitting, that it makes sense to them.

The important thing is that it makes sense to them, makes sense to me, and then we can work together to help them stop smoking.

Q.  And do the folks � the folks that you treat in your clinical practice, which we'll � by the way, how many � how many smokers, addicted or � strike that.

Q.  So to the extent the jury is listening, if we do occasionally use words like "dependence," "abuse," "addiction," you mean the same thing by it?

A.  I do.

Q.  Okay.  How many smokers have you taken care of and treated, please?

A.  So over all these years, I figure I've either treated myself or supervised over a thousand cases of smokers.

And so I have a sense, a baseline sense of, you know, whose got a mild case, whose got a moderate case, whose got a severe case.

I can kind of � I have a baseline to try to understand what that means for this disorder, tobacco use disorder.

Q.  Okay.  And then � the default proposition, these smokers that you're taking care

as soon as they come in the door as to whether or

not they're addicted?

A.  No, I have a totally open mind.  My attitude is that � I don't know who is going to quit and who isn't.

And my job is to support them, give them hope, to do everything we possibly can to get them to quit.

And my hope is that everybody will quit, and that can be heartbreaking when people don't or they get ill or they already are ill.

And if you can't help them, it's very upsetting, but that's part of my job.

Q.  And I asked it inartfully.  What I was trying to establish with you is whether or not the default proposition, your understanding of the patients that come to you, whether your default understanding is they're dependent on the nicotine cigarettes?

A.  Well, I think � I think � the ones who come to me have already failed pretty much.  You know, that's how they get to me.

So they're already struggling with it. So they're going to have some level of dependence

Page 5511 typically, or else why would they come?

If they could do it on their own, they certainly wouldn't be coming to me.  These are people that have tried with a doctor.  Most of them have already tried with a doctor and not done well, or they've tried on their own, they're very frustrated, and somehow they find me.

So the guestion in my mind is, is it going to be � you know, can they guit pretty guickly?

And a lot of them do.  Some of them do. Are they going to � are they going to be able to � are they go to be � have to work with me for months or years or whatever?

You know, it's � sometimes the cases get to be much more difficult.

Q.  All right.  In your practice, are you able to identify impaired control in smokers?

A.  I believe so.  That's � I think that's why they're coming.  They intend to guit, but then their intentions are not translated into their actions.

Q.  Why is it hard for addicted smokers to

quit'

most � in our � in our society, we expect people

to do this on their own.

It's a self-help culture around smoking, and most smokers believe it's their personal responsibility to quit on their own.

And what happens is when they try to do it, if it doesn't go well, they � they blame themselves.

They get � they get � they lose their confidence, and then they're afraid to try, and there's a lot of � there's a lot of science about if your efforts and the outcome of your efforts are not aligned, like if you keep trying something and you're not getting the outcome, you'll learn to feel helpless.

And that's what I think a lot of smokers have.  They feel that they can't do it.  They start to believe that they can't do it, and that's part of the problem.

And what � what you do as � as a therapist, or someone who is trying to help them do it, you're trying to build their confidence, you're trying to give them support, and you're trying to challenge some of the beliefs that they

of the problem.

Q.  Is nicotine addiction a psychological

problem?

A.  Well, it's driven by the � by the chemistry, the chemical dependency on nicotine. If you took the nicotine out of the cigarette, nobody would smoke it.

But it has a psychology.  Everybody believes that addiction has a psychology, that people lose their autonomy when � this is part of your guestion about impaired control.

People lose their feeling of will and having self-control, self-government over their own lives.

And that's � that's what they don't like about it, and that's part of why they want to get out of it.

And most smokers would like to guit. Over the years, 75 percent of smokers wish they'd guit.

define real quick.

I'm not going to presume any knowledge

of medical terms, but "autonomy," what does that

mean?

A.  Autonomy is the feeling that you can � you have controls over your � over your own � what you want, you know, your actions, and that it's not compromised, that you're not controlled by something outside yourself, which is part of the problem with addiction is that people feel controlled by � by the drug, by the product, the cigarette, and they feel that their own ability to � to make a choice is compromised.

Q.  Does it � can you say one way or the other, does addiction perpetuate itself?  Is there any cyclical self-perpetuation of addiction, and how do you describe it when you're teaching your � your patients what you're trying to do to help them?  How do you explain that?

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Do you have a perception �

A.  Yeah.

Q.  � or analogy or what the feeling of nicotine addiction is for patients?

A.  Right.  Right.

I would compare it to driving a car that doesn't have brakes, that you feel out of control, and that each time you take a cigarette, it's like putting fuel into that car.

When you're really addicted, when you're seriously addicted, you're � you're driving a car that has no brakes, and you don't feel in control of that experience.

Q.  You've been working now in the field of nicotine addiction over 25 years?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What got you interested in it?

A.  Well, when I got my first job at Columbia, they said:  We want you to do this, run this smoking cessation program, and they said:

Let's see.

And here I am, over 25 years later still

finding it interesting and challenging.  So that's

how I got into it.

Q.  Interested in loss of autonomy from nicotine dependence?

A.  I'm very interested in that problem, yes .

Q.  Written books on the subject?

A.  Well, I've written a book for doctors to help them with their patients.  I've written a book for smokers.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I've written those two books.

Q.  Are you doing innovations in the field of nicotine cessation, cutting-edge stuff as well?

A.  Well, we tried everything.  We've had � we've had storefronts in Washington Heights. We've worked in corporations.  We've worked in hospital systems.

And I got interested in about the year 2000 in trying to see if we could use the Internet as a tool to help smokers.

Internet system, and then eventually we developed

that.

And there was a national study run by

the American Cancer Society that we participated

in.

And we were the � we were the one that

got the best results.  So we did very well with

that.

Q.  So did you invent a website that you've put out there into the world to try to help folks smoke � quit smoking?

A.  Yeah.  We ended up selling it to something called the American Legacy Foundation.

Q.  I just � I only wanted to show the cover page of it.  It's called BecomeAnEx.com?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And has this become adopted and used by the Mayo Clinic now?

A.  Yes, that's correct.

Q.  And is it the Internet stop-smoking system that you created and invented and put out there?

And doctors also � I teach at a medical school.  They have so many other things they have to do.

Even though they care about this, it's hard to develop expertise and addiction treatment.

It takes time.

So we developed � and really it' s an app that goes on the smart phone that's little videos which are meant to be like sitting down with me, you know, at low cost that people can use to try to help them quit smoking or potentially use with a doctor or a nurse or, you know, any kind of healthcare professional.

Q.  This is the Mental Workout app?

A.  Yes.

And are there, I mean, 50 or 100 short video vignettes of you talking so that you're giving encouragement and support to the � to the smoker as to what copying strategies they can employ to try to get them off the addiction?

A.  Right, trying to teach about behavioral strategies and change attitudes and challenge beliefs and do all the things we would do if we were sitting down with them in person.

A.  Well, you know, it certainly doesn't help.  I think that still in those days people were inclined to believe what tobacco companies said.

And it was unfortunate that the thing they said to the public was different than the things they were saying in private, like, you know:  We have these people hooked, and:  We can keep them forever.

Q.  In the clinical setting, out in the community, in the United States in the communities and the places you work, what are the frontline treatments for folks that have been seeking help with regard to their cigarette addictions?

Who are the � who are the people that take care of those people at the frontlines, in your experience?

A.  Well, in my experience, there really aren't clinics in most of the major medical centers because it's difficult to figure out the funding for the clinics.

So what most smokers are being offered are telephone quitline sessions which help � help somewhere under ten percent of them, or something like that, to quit.

But that seems to be the most � the most prevalent form now of treatment that's available.

You can try to find maybe a psychologist or something, but most � most psychologists don't specialize in this.

Most psychiatrists certainly don't

A.  A very small percentage of smokers get any kind of counseling for smoking cessation.

One � somewhere around four percent of smokers, maybe one and a half percent gets some individual counseling.  Maybe two and a half percent get some group counseling.

Very few people go for counseling, get counseling, and there's very little specialized knowledge available.

Page 5524 It's one of the things that's been very

frustrating to me.  I believe that accredited

healthcare institutions should offer smoking

cessation clinics.

But it's very hard to finance them

that's the way our system works.

Q.  You try to get that word out?  You try to get that word out?

A.  I do.

Q.  And so what about what private care, PCPs � nowadays, in this managed care world we live in, we talk about the internist or the private � the private care practitioner, the PCP. Is � can you tell the jurors, for a lot of smokers who have an addiction problem, whether the PCP is a frontline person that they will go to to try to get some help with some medicine or some patches or some advice?

A.  Yeah.  Well, I think they're supposed to ask about it.  It's part of, you know, the more modern training.  That's what we're teaching them to do, ask about it.

And they believe young � the young medical doctors that I'm treating � not treating,

Page 5525 teaching, believe that it's something that they

should try to do.

But they have so many other things to do, and they don't have that much specialized knowledge about it.  So it's difficult for them.

But it does come up in the course of that, and some of them are more talented about doing it than others.

And that's a large way that I get referrals, is from those people, the primary care doctors, that's what they're called.

Q.  And as we're here today, is your current teaching or your scholastic endeavors beginning to include psychiatric students and psychiatrist doctors?

A.  Well, I think they have other things that they're doing.  Mostly � mostly psychiatrists are not doing this.

But we're going to train � we're going to train the psychiatry department as a whole because, these days, about half the smokers have some kind of psychiatric problem.

That's what � that's what's going on out there.  So it's important to deal with it in the psychiatric population.

younger than the regular � the nonpsychiatric

population, and a lot of that has to do with

smoking.

Q.  What I guess I was going to ask you is, are you involved in launching a program to help teach psychiatrists more about what to do to help folks quit smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And before the implementation of that, can you tell the jurors whether or not the psychiatric medical community, are they firstline smoking cessation counselors?  Is that something they're involved in or not?

A.  Well, I think it's � it's pretty rare that � I mean, most of the � most of the work that's done is probably done by nurses or some psy- � a lot of the psychologists do the research, and a lot of them are interested in clinical work.

But it's very hard to find a practitioner if you're a smoker.  You really � you have to go out of your way, even to find me. People have to � they have to go out of their way to find me.

A.  I've become the � you know, the specialist in this area, the teacher for this.  We don't � there are some other people who have been doing it.

We had � one of the � one of the great early figures in smoking cessation who got me into this is named Dr. Glassman.  He's the one who trained me, and he's no longer living.

So one of his other people that worked with him, Lirio Covey, is still there.  So we're � you know, we're sort of the new generation doing it

conditions.

And we've applied it to smoking cessation very successfully, and it's really unfortunate that it's not widely available to smokers.

And what it is, is it's � the cognitive part is that you � you challenge ideas which are considered maladaptive or that promote a kind of behavior that the person wants to change.

So in this case, a lot of � a lot of the smokers would have the idea that they can't quit.

So you might want to � you'd have to work with to challenge that idea and get them to restructure it and look at it a different way.

A lot of them believe � the severely addicted ones believe that they can't live without the cigarette, which, you know, may be a curious thing to people who aren't smokers, who aren't heavily addicted.

But they start to believe that they can't live without the cigarette, even though that's the thing that's threatening their health.

Page 5530 common criteria you hear from smokers in a

particular severity category?

A.  Yeah, it's a � it's a � it's a � it's an all too un- � you know, it's common thing that I hear that people start to believe that they can't cope with their life, they can't cope with the stress, they can't get through the day without a cigarette, they need the cigarette.

And what we found is that when you do get them to quit, their lives are less stressful, they have less depression and less anxiety, not more.

So it was a myth that was created, I think, through advertising that smoking was a way to handle modern life and the difficulties and the demands of modern life.  I think that was created by the tobacco industry.

Q.  Now this � this particular book, is this one of the first books you wrote?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then is this your more recent book?

A.  That's the book for the smokers, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So this is for the clinicians, and this is for the smokers?

A.  Exactly.

when I reviewed the records.

Q. Did you come to a thorough analysis in your field of specialty to determine whether or not he was addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Yeah, I would characterize him as severely addicted to it.

Q.  All right.  And as an overview of your opinions � and we'11 get into more detail after lunch � Mr. Shulman was severely addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, is that one of the conclusions you drew after a thorough analysis of this case?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Similarly, that Mr. Shulman's nicotine addiction affected his control over smoking, and he developed a failure syndrome?

A.  Yes, I believe that's correct.

Q. You feel that's an accurate diagnostic description of Mr. Shulman?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you're ready to explain it after lunch?

A.  Yes.

prolonged smoking, leading to the causation of

smoking-related diseases?

A.  I believe that, yes.

Q.  All right.  And that was a conclusion you drew after analysis?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And, finally, that every cigarette contributes to sustain the chain of addiction, is that something you believe about nicotine addiction in Mr. Shulman?

A.  I do believe it.  Every cigarette makes you need the next cigarette, and I believe that was true for him.

Q.  And is that from the nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And, finally, before we stop for lunch, is � if a person smokes � would any person � from what you know about nicotine addiction, would any � is there such a thing � is it possible there is such a thing as a person that would smoke a pack a day of cigarettes for 30 or more years if the cigarettes didn't have nicotine in them?

A    Right.

Q    Extensive interviews and depositions of Mr. Shulman?

A    Correct.

Q    Including examination of Mr. Shulman by a fellow that the defense asked to examine Mr. Shulman as well?

A    Right.  The medical exam, certified medical exam.

Q    There's a lengthy and extensive interview over two days, many hours of data extracting info about Mr. Shulman's lifetime of smoking that you used to incorporate into your thinking?

A    Yes.

Q    Did you thoroughly digest all of those materials?

A    I tried my hardest to do that.

Q    All right.  So what I'd like you to do is � in a synthesis, and I'll guide you as we go, is can you give the jurors sort of a timeline or an

Page 5545 overview of the arc of the trajectory of

Mr. Shulman's longtime smoking going all the way back

to the '30s when he began, please?

A    I believe that the bulk of his smoking started about 1934, '35, when he was 14, 15 years old.  There is some evidence that he might have tried it when he was ten, but when he was a middle school student, he wanted to affiliate with his friends, like all young people do, and they were smoking.  And he joined them and he wanted to be cool, and he wanted to be part of it.  He wanted to find out what it was all about.  He started smoking daily to kind of prove to himself or to be part of it.

And then within about two months he started -- he went from wanting to do it to craving it and needing it.  So it happened very fast for him, which does happen.  There's -- in terms of the science of how quickly this can happen, it's a lot quicker than people think.

So in several months he was a daily smoker. In those days, in the '30s in the depression, money was tight.  He didn't always have money.  He did a lot of odd jobs.  He used all that money for the cigarettes.  If he didn't have money, he would take them out of the street, lit butts or whatever he

One of the interesting things about the

story that stuck out to me was when he was about 16,

in those days they used to make house visits, the

doctor came to the house and he asked him, can you

help me stop smoking?  A 16-year-old kid said, can

you help me stop smoking?

I thought that was an indication he already

knew that he wanted to stop because he was getting in

trouble with school, and it was expensive and his

parents were very unhappy about the expense because

money was tight.  He asked the doctor and the doctor

said, I don't know anything about it.

Q    Back at that period of time, would that be consistent with the public and the medical community's general lack of understanding of the deeply addictive nature of cigarettes?

A    Well, of course.  I think it's been a problem all along.  So one of the things about adolescence � this is considered a pediatric or a developmental disease because teenagers get more of the reward and less of the withdrawal than adults. That's why most of the people who start smoking do so before they're 18.  It's something like 90 percent, maybe 93 percent by 21.  By 27, 99 percent of the

Q    Is that true in Mr. Shulman's case?

A    He was smoking when he was 14.

Q    So was he an adolescent smoker?

A    He was a teen smoker.

Q    Does that � is that consistent or inconsistent with what you know about the nature of nicotine addiction as a pediatric developmental disease?

A    The earlier you start smoking, the more likely you are to have a dependence on smoking, the most likely you are to be a daily smoker, be a persistent smoker, and have a problem with it, that's clearly established.

Q    Since we're still in the pediatric realm with Mr. Shulman, what is it about the vulnerability of the pediatric brain to the exposure to nicotine that seems to latch on in childhood years to create �

A    The brain in maturing -- a lot of the more mature functions are not there and the nicotine gets in the wiring early, as I was saying before, it's more likely to persist and it also does predispose people to other kinds of substance abuse.

Q    You said it gets in the wiring.  What do you mean by that?

A    In the brain circuits, it's -- they're much more impressionable at that age and more likely to become addicted.

Q    That book you wrote, Helping the Hard-Core Smoker, you were the editor and chapter contributor of that book?

A    Yes.

Q    Did you also work with a neuroscientist in that regard?

A    Yes, I did.

Q    In what you do for a living, do you keep current on the research and the studies and what we've learned about nicotine addiction over the years?

A    I do.  But one of the remarkable things about the field and part of why I like it is you can keep learning.  There's thousands and � there's a huge number of studies coming out all the time, so it's a challenge and it's always interesting and fascinating to �

Q    Is the science evolving?

your current experience you feel that cigarettes

addictive than ever?

MR. FURR:  Objection �

THE COURT:  By sustaining it, I struck the last answer so the jury should disregard it.

I'm sorry, what was it?

MR. FURR:  Same objection to this question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I approach briefly, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm trying to stay consistent with your pretrial orders around this.  There's a pretrial order on this where you permitted this testimony from this witness.

THE COURT:  My understanding is, first of all, it's cumulative because you already had a witness for six days on cigarette design.  I allowed the witness to testify on cigarette design.  Why are you asking this witness about cigarette decide?

design.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm asking him why his

job is harder -- his job treating people today

is harder because the cigarettes are more

addictive than ever.  So he's the man in the

A    Yes.

Page 5553 years.  Let's stick with that and let you continue to

fill in and explain what you saw in the biography of

his smoking, please?

A    Okay.  I saw something which I think is very common with a lot of kinds of substance abuse and with nicotine addiction is the progression of the disease, it's a developmental disease.  So at 21 he was smoking a pack.  And then from 25 to 45, he was somewhere between 25 and 30 cigarettes, which would be about a pack and a half.  So he increased the amount.

Also, he was, you know � he had a young family, there were issues with expenses.  He was trying to keep the level down of his smoking for those reasons, but nonetheless, over time it crept up to two packs a day.  So when I'm listening to that, I'm thinking, this is a guy who needs more just to stay even.

Then in the late '60s, around 1970 or so, he switched to the filters.  At that time he was already around two packs.  He went above two packs a day.  According to him, he smoked incessantly.  He smoked all the time.  He lit one from another and that's what his son said, too, that he was constantly craving it.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer that the witness gave. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Did you find the testimony that others observed about his smoking behavior?

A    I did.  I listened to what his son had to say, who was very close to him.

Q    Okay.  So without quoting from what his son said, even though you use these things as the basis of it, what is your conclusion about his smoking behavior based on the materials that you used to come to these conclusions?

Obviously you weren't there, you didn't know him?

A    Right.

Q    Okay.  But reading from the folks that did and incorporating that into what your understanding, your synthesis is in this, without quoting from what someone said �

A    So the totality of what I read looked to me like somebody who had an illness, an addiction that progressed over time, that went from a pack to a pack and a half to two packs, and then with the filters he was above two packs, smoking more and more agitated,

agitated all the time, leaving a lot of social events

early because he wasn't getting enough nicotine and

he needed to go out and get a fix.

Q    Did you see to what extent, if any, the

filters intercepted his opportunity to quit, please?

Argumentative.

Page 5556 Q    In the course of what you do, what's

cognitive behavioral therapy?

A   We challenge the beliefs that keep � a behavior that the person wants to change, we challenge those beliefs, we try to get them to look at it from a different vantage point, to shift where they are, their perspective, and get them to open it up, open it up.  So we would challenge certain kinds of beliefs in somebody who is addicted at that level �

Q    In order to treat patients such as Mr. Shulman, do you need to assess and test for what their beliefs are?

A    Yes.

Q    The same way as a cardiologist might do a blood test to get the results of a blood test, it's a lab test that gives data that the clinician incorporates into thinking about the case?

A    These are the tools of our trade.

Q    Could you practice cognitive behavioral therapy without investigating and learning about the beliefs of the patient?

A    No.

Q    Would you be able to explain to the jury what it is you do or how Mr. Shulman was dependent on

his beliefs were about smoking?

A    No, I think it's very relevant to the problem.

Q    Is it an essential and inextricably integrated component of what you do for a living?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    All right.  So without quoting from him, what was your assessment of what beliefs, if any, he had with regard to filters and what role that played in his nicotine addiction, please?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Necessarily calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    He believed that this was an alternative that was healthier, safer, and less harmful.  He believed this was a strategy for harm reduction and millions of people believed it.  It wasn't a strange belief.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, as to what other people believed. THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  Move to strike.

Page 5558 THE COURT:  I strike the last answer.  The

jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Is there anything out of the ordinary about Mr. Shulman as a patient and can you tell the jurors whether this is something common in your experience or uncommon?

A    I think with people who are severely addicted they tend to develop certain kinds of beliefs which to me indicates something that has to be tackled if we're going to help them.

Q    Okay.  Did he have a conceptualization of the harm that tobacco might befall him?  Where was he in that regard with regard to his smoking, his addiction, and what role his beliefs about the harm may have played, please?

A    I think that Mr. Shulman believed they wouldn't sell it if it wasn't harmful.  They would never sell a product that wasn't healthy for you.  He believed that.

Q Is that � within the context of nicotine dependent patients that you see, is that a typical, atypical, or outlier belief of any kind?

A    Nowadays I think it's more known how unhealthy it is, but when the filters came out, he

Page 5559 thought that was an answer.  He didn't know if --

there was a question about how harmful it was or not.

It's hard for us to go back to 1970.  It's

45 years ago.  It's hard to believe, but people then

were struggling, is it healthy?  It is unhealthy?  He

didn't know if it was healthy or unhealthy.  He

thought, here is a hedge.  If I get these filters, if

it is unhealthy, the filter is intuitively such a

good thing that it's going to protect me.  He did

believe that.

Q    How does that intercept overcoming addiction, if at all?

A   Well, he never really believed that it was, you know, going to cause serious disease.  He thought he was buying fun, thought he was buying something that was not about disease and not about addiction.

Q    Have you yourself � when you teach students, you teach courses, lifestyle changes and prevention to fourth-year medical students, behavioral techniques to psychology doctoral students, do you include lectures on nicotine addiction in those courses to these medical students?

A    Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, Your Honor, the question --

THE COURT:  That's the one that I already overruled.

MR. FURR:  Your realtime is stuck where mine is, Judge.

It was a question about the role of tobacco advertising and how it affected -- that's why I objected.  Dr. Proctor talked about that for a long time.

THE COURT:  Mine, something is not up to date on here.

MR. FURR:  Would you like for us to work on that one for you?

advertising and what role it plays.  So rather than

speak generally about it based on your familiarity, I

want you to apply it to Mr. Shulman.  Can you tell

the jurors, did tobacco advertising have a role in

influencing and contributing to his dependence on

nicotine in cigarettes while he was a smoker?

because I'm asking this man to comment on

Mr. Shulman specifically, when Dr. Proctor did

Q    Do you read all of the materials � I think

Mr. Shulman was deposed over four or five days by the

defendants, thousands of pages of testimony, eight

hours of an interview by a fellow named Dr. Hoge, who

I anticipate they'll bring, who is a psychiatrist

interviewing him, as well as all of the family

members that observed him.

Did you read in Mr. Shulman's depo and his

transcript of his examination report everything he

had to say about what role, if any, he thought the

advertising played to allay his fears about

cigarettes?  Did you read that?

A    I read that, yes.

Q   All right.  Do you feel you have a good understanding to give the jurors a scientific conclusion based upon reasonable degrees of scientific certainty as to, Number 1, whether or not advertising influenced Mr. Shulman's smoking behavior and contributed to his addiction?  Don't give me the opinion.  Tell me whether you have come to that conclusion.

A    Yes.

Q    Is that conclusion based on good science in the practice that you employ every day with your patients?

A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  Do you, in fact, reflect with your patients about the role the advertising played?

A    Yes.

contribution to Mr. Shulman's addiction as a result

of tobacco advertising?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Foundation. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q    You may answer, please.

A    I think whatever doubts he had in his mind about product, he thought that he was making a choice to do the safer thing by switching to a filtered cigarette.  He had some kind of reassurance based on the advertising that that was safer for him, that the filter made a lot of sense to him.

It was intuitively reasonable that that was going to � if there was a problem, which he wasn't convinced there was, because he believed that they wouldn't sell it if there was a problem, if it was unhealthy, if there was a problem, the filter was an answer and he did believe that.  And I think it affected his smoking behavior.

Q    Okay.  So the jurors have already heard that grant money is money for research around things like that but it's competitive, you have to apply for it and get the grant money, right?

A    Yes.

Q    So when it comes to addiction, not just of � let me ask it this way.

Substance abuse in forms of drugs, harder drugs like heroin, cocaine, opiates, maybe even marijuana, nicotine, alcohol, do these drugs have a similar or dissimilar pattern of features that go along with dependence compared to tobacco, please?

A    Well, I think in all these drugs there are differences and they are similarities, but the way � many of the features are similar.  The compulsion to use the drug, the loss of control, and the continuing to use the drug when there are what's called adverse consequences, when there are problems related to it, they all have that in common.  Also, they also work by means of the same circuits in the brain.  They all tend to manipulate the dopamine system �

Page 5568 MR. FURR:  I move to strike the answer and

make a bigger objection.  During the deposition

in this case Dr. Seidman was asked, how do brain

receptors respond to drugs like cocaine and

heroin?  That's what he's talking about right

now.  His answer was, you know, this is just

beyond my scope.  I'm not here to talk about

cocaine and heroin.  That is what he told us

about in his deposition.  This is a bigger

problem, non-disclosed expert opinion.  This was

February 16 of this year at page 805, lines 12

through 16 of his deposition.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I've got an 800-page deposition, this witness has covered all of these subjects.  I'm not able to in this setting -- if you want to go back and spend 30 minutes.

THE COURT:  Right now I'm going to grant the motion to strike the testimony. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  All right.  I've sustained the last objection.  The jury should disregard in its entirely the last answer given by the witness.  It's of no value, no evidentiary value.

THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    When it comes to talking about the things that trip up or obstacles to quitting, we've talked about advertising.  With nicotine addiction for a patient like Mr. Shulman, when you're trying to treat someone that has a substance addiction, is a clear concise message important to them?  Do you give them hope?  Do you offer them opportunities to quit?  Do you encourage them that they can quit?

A    When they come, I don't know who is going to be able to do what.  I do all of the things that I do with everybody.  I take the position that I don't know what's going to happen and I'm openminded, and I try to help everybody as best I can.

Q    Can you tell the jurors whether or not confusion about an addictive drug, uncertainty, doubt, whether or not that is a problem for people like you that are trying to take care of folks who need to quit cigarettes?

A    One of the jobs of somebody like me is to get them to break out of what's called minimization or denial or the way they try to disconnect from the problem.  You want to get them to take it as

If they think it's a normal behavior, if

they think they need it for stress, if they have the

idea that's going to help them with their depression,

even if those things are completely false, those

things do confuse them.  A lot of those ideas are out

there in society and they've been shown by science to

be false.

you how to answer.  You tell us.

MR. FURR:  Cumulative.  Objection. Cumulative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, it's an epidemic of death and disease. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Is it durable?

A    I don't know what you mean by that. Q    Intractable?

A    Well, we have a similar number of people smoking today as we did when the Surgeon General's report came out.  Now, it's true that the population has doubled, but it's still 45 million people. Q    Why �

A    That's an enormous number of people. Q    Why is it so hard to eradicate?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  There's no foundation for this testimony.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He just said the foundation in the last three questions. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q    For instance?

A    That smoking helps with stress.  We know now that addiction is stressful.  Quitting gets rid of your stress.  People who quit have less stress, but everybody believes that smoking relieves the stress --

Page 5575 up in this area, what were you taught, what was your

understanding of the science then with regard to the

beneficent effects of cigarette smoking, please?

A    We were taught it was something called a psychological tool, that it helped you cope with stress, with depression, with anxiety, and that that's what people were really looking for in a cigarette.  All the research shows that it doesn't help with those things, that smokers have more stress, anxiety, and depression, and quitters have less stress, anxiety, and depression.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection to the last

Early on you were taught to believe that smoking relieved stress.  That was the science back then?

A    No.

Q    Okay.  So I'm going to ask the court

reporter to read back the last question that His

Honor overruled the objection to and then you can

answer.

(The court reporter read back the requested portion of

testimony.)

THE WITNESS:  The science today is that it's very stressful to be addicted.  That when you look at smokers who quit, their levels of stress literally go down a year later.  Their depression goes down and their anxiety goes down.  So we were taught that smoking was a way to handle those things.  It turns out that smoking caused a lot of those things.  Smoking is associated with those things and quitting actually makes all those things better.  That's what we can see today from the science out there.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Based upon your evaluation in this case,

did you come to any scientific conclusions, opinions,

based upon reasonable scientific certainty as to

whether Mr. Shulman suffered from what you've seen in

belief syndrome, please?

A   He believed that he needed to smoke to live, and I know that's a strange, strange idea, but it's very common in severely addicted smokers and he had that belief.  It's a false belief because you can't protect your health in any way if you're a smoker.  He believed that he needed to smoke to live.

Q    That book, Hard-Core Smoker, if you apply that to Mr. Shulman, would he meet the criteria or not of what you consider to be a hard-core smoker?

A    By every criteria that we use to measure this, by any measurement tool, he is at the high end of nicotine addiction.  He's at the severe end of it.

Q    What do you do � how do you interact � obviously Mr. Shulman is no longer a smoker.  What do you do in patients such as he if you're with them to try to encourage them to believe or re � do the cognitive behavior therapy to change their thinking to encourage them to believe it's possible they can quit?  What do you tell the smokers, say to them? What do you teach them when you're treating them?

medicines, the nicotine replacement therapies and the

other medicines, which I'll -- I work with their

doctor to prescribe if I can't prescribe it.  I don't

prescribe medicine.  But I'll work with them on the

medicines, which actually are not that simple to do

well.  People often under dose themselves and don't

get the proper amounts.

I work with them on behavioral strategies,

how to deal with difficult situations, how to deal

with other smokers, how to deal with stress in

healthy ways, and I challenge the kinds of beliefs

that they have which perpetuate the behavior.

Q    Are you always successful?

A    I wish I was.

Q    All right.  How does it work?  With your patients, what are the different categories of folks and what are your success rates depending on the severity of their addiction, please?

A    Well, as I was saying in the beginning, there are some people I can see once or twice and they do great, they have a mild case, they're fine. That's always a nice thing to see.

Other people have to work a lot harder at it and maybe a little longer period of time to quit.

Now, I mean, at this juncture, I would -- just for the Court for the record, Your Honor, I will be proffering a couple of the excerpts of those videos from his app � you already ruled on, but just so the record is clear, this is where I've made the proffer of those you've already ruled on, the little short minute videos.  I would like to show the jurors this slide and ask you to help define for them �

THE COURT:  Are you making a proffer of the demonstrative?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It was the videos that we were talking about.

THE COURT:  Those were just the demonstratives?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, we proffered �

THE COURT:  I don't think you proffer demonstratives.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry. THE COURT:  Let's move on. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    At this juncture is there any established single consensus definition of what tobacco addiction, tobacco abuse, tobacco dependence is?

A    Well, the addiction I would go by is that it's a compulsive behavior, the smoking, that involves a loss of control and adverse � despite adverse consequences.

Q    All right.  We put this up.  Addiction is defined as a chronic relapse in brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug-seeking and use despite harmful consequences.  Is that one of the ways you think about it?

A    That's one of the definitions, yes.

Q    All right.  When we did talk about your book and we were talking about advertising, if you want to say it in a word, if you want to show it in a word, is daily smoking or chronic smoking a form of drug addiction?

A    If you smoke every day, your brain will adapt to that and you will expect it.  So, yes, it's

Most people who use it every day will have changes in

their brain, which could have serious consequences to

them.

Q    And then even in your book you have sections entitled How the Media Created Our Cultural Beliefs About Smoking, you talked about that, right?

A    Yes.

Q   You talked about the role of the tobacco industry in creating a false belief syndrome?

Q    Mr. Shulman suffered from a false belief syndrome created by the tobacco industry?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative today. MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is a different

question.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    I think it's clear that he did.  He believed they would not sell the product if it was unhealthy.  That's what he believed.  He believed a major American corporation would never do that.

Q    I want you to assume that this jury has heard evidence and seen documentary evidence

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  � a question. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    So let's show this.  Is this also, in your teaching, your � when you're teaching and trying to explain to folks why they're having such a hard time quitting, folks like Mr. Shulman � which, by the way, does Mr. Shulman fit into the category of what we call a generic smoking?  Were his smoking patterns like some of the others you've seen?

A    I was trying to explain in the beginning that there's really apples and oranges, there's people with the mild kinds of addictions, it's much easier for them to stop, and then there are people with severe addictions and I believe he fits into the later category.

Q    Within that category, does he fit the picture in that category in the way that is recognizable to you as generic of all of the others that fit in that category?  Is it typical or

A    It has a lot of the hallmarks of what I would be looking for when I would be trying to assess that.

Q    Do you try to explain or teach � when your patients have a question, why are you still smoking even though you want to quit, do you describe the tobacco changes the brain's chemistry and hijacks the body's own pleasure system, the endorphins, creating a dependency on the outside action, in this case smoking, to alter the mood?  Do you teach that?

A    Yeah.

MR. FURR:  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer.  Please ask your

question. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Let me ask it this way.  Is this something you teach?

A    Yes.

Q    Will you read it to the jury, please?

A    Tobacco changes the brain's chemistry and hijacks the body's own pleasure system, the endorphins, creating a dependency on an outside action, in this case smoking, to alter mood.

Page 5585 Q    Now, do you feel that's a currently

scientifically accurate description of the problems

you have with taking care of your smokers?

A    Well, I think a lot of the research involves the dopamine system, but I think the endorphins are involved.  Many of the different neurotransmitter systems are involved in this.  So the basic principle is the same, that people feel that they've lost their ability for self-control, self-government of their will, of their actions, if they're taken over by a product that's coming from outside them that has a chemical basis.

Q    As I'm going through this, I'm sort of weaving in some of the things I know you do professionally, but besides the web site that you've developed that the Mayo Clinic has, besides the app you can get at the Apple App store for a phone on the mental workout and how to quit, the public videos, you've got your own web site up, don't you?

A    Yes, I do.

Q   What's that called?

A    That's based on the book.

Q    Okay.  Is that web site up with ideas on how to help folks quit smoking?

A    Yes.  I run a blog at the Huffington Post

Q    How long have you been a contributing blogger for the Huffington Post?

A    For I think it's five years now, four or five years.

Q   A subject matter of a lot of those posts have to do with getting folks to understand the nature and severity of their nicotine addiction?

A    It's all about smoking and nicotine.

Q    All right.  I have a slide here.  I think we did this but I'm going to hit real quick, Number 9, material review.  We talked about a bunch of it.  So I did it in sort of a fast overview.  Is this some of the materials that you've reviewed?

A    Yes.

Q    How many hours have you spent working on this case?

A    A lot of hours.

Q    How many hours does it take when you're having your first session with a new patient who you're going to try to help quit smoking and get over their addiction?  How many hours do you spend in your initial consultation?

Q Within that hour are you able to assess and determine whether or not they have mild, moderate, or severe dependency?

A    Yeah, I think so, based on my experience and my knowledge of the field and the problem.

Q   Okay.  So when it comes to Mr. Shulman, was your assessment and determination that he was suffering from tobacco dependency that was driving his smoking behavior for all those years, was that a complex or difficult assessment to do or conclusion to arrive at?  Was that difficult for you?

A    No.

Q Was it a cloudy, muddy, or uncertain case from your perspective as a clinician?

A    No.

Q   So you also got a chance to fill in the blanks and speak with Mr. Shulman a little bit?

A    Yes.

Q I don't think you met him before today, did you?

A    No, we never said hello.

Q Okay. Now, when you interviewed him, did you ask any questions of him in particular? Do you remember anything you interacted with him about in

A    Well, I did ask him if he smoked when he was sick.  I didn't see that in the record.

Q    All right.

A    He said he did.

Q    All right.  So can you tell the jurors, after you assessed him and � did you assess him across all of the batteries and formal instruments that help evaluate smoking?

A    I did.  I mean, it's important to use more than one measure because the different measures tend to look at a different piece of the problem.  So I used three different measures and I scored them.

Q    Okay.  Okay.  Did you need to do that to figure out that Mr. Shulman was addicted and that was what was driving his smoking?  In other words, in the clinical setting would you do that in the � do you do that in your clinical setting where you're actually treating your patients?

A    I think in the course of getting the story I learn everything I need to learn.  Things come out.

Q Okay. I want the jurors to know whether or not in your practice do you actually administer these batteries of tests?

A    I don't administer them as such, but I'm

I need to know.

Q    The key features from those instruments �

A    Yeah.

Q    � are within your awareness when you diagnose?

A    Yes.  What are the withdrawal symptoms, what are the key predicters of quitting, for example, time to the first cigarette in the morning is a key thing, and he had three or four cigarettes right away before he was even awake, he said.  Or how many cigarettes a day you smoke, some instruments measure that, some don't.  So we needed a combination of instruments to sort of get at all of the different criteria that are relevant to making the assessment.

Q    So after your review, did you � we already talked about him being dependent, addictive, can you tell the jurors did you come to a conclusion as to whether or not that dependence within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty drove the smoking that you saw in Mr. Shulman?

A    Well, I don't think there's any question about that, because he's pretty clear that after the initial time when he enjoyed it with his friends, he didn't enjoy it.  He felt he needed to do it.  He was

Page 5590 driven to do it.  For decades and decades he was

smoking more and more and more because of the

chemical dependency.  It wasn't that he was doing it

because he was enjoying it.  It wasn't because he was

having a good time.

He's what we call a negative reinforcement

smoker, somebody who smokes to stay even, somebody

who smokes to get rid of a bad feeling.  That's what

he is.  If he wasn't addicted to the nicotine, he

never would have touched it.

Q    What is the avoidance of withdrawal that you see in the kind of tobacco dependence that Mr. Shulman was suffering from, please?

A    I think, you know, it may be hard to picture exactly, but the symptoms of nicotine dependence are very similar to the symptoms of clinical depression.  In a severe case, it looks like that.  A lot of the symptoms that he described are the kinds of things someone would go through if they were going through a severe clinical depression, which is a horrible thing.

Q    Did you come to any conclusions as to whether or not the way in which Mr. Shulman changed his smoking, his smoking behavior, the kinds of cigarettes he smoked, and how much he smoked allowed

Page 5591 you to conclude whether or not he had demonstrated

what's called compensation one way or the other?

A    I came to the conclusion that he had that because when he switched to the filters, he couldn't get the satisfaction out of them, and he upped his smoking guite a bit.  He was agitated all the time. He wasn't getting satisfied from the cigarette.  He needed that nicotine.  He was very clear about that. He couldn't get enough with the filter.  He had to puff on it harder.  It still wasn't enough.

Q   Then we had one part of that slide about the dependence contributed to cause his tobacco-related diseases.  Do you believe that was true in Mr. Shulman's case?

A    I don't think there's any guestion because he wasn't �

Q    I want you to assume hypothetically there's medical testimony in the record that Mr. Shulman's smoking caused his bladder cancer, his heart disease, and his COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. You know about these illnesses and injuries as a consequence of tobacco dependence already in your role, don't you?

A    Yes, I work with these patients all the time.

Q    Okay.  In that regard, assuming that's true, I want you to look at the other end of it.  Can you tell the jurors if that's true, from your perspective as a nicotine addiction researcher and clinician, whether the nicotine addiction substantially contributed to those diseases, please? MR. FURR:  Same objection.  Calls for a

medical opinion.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Does nicotine addiction cause or contribute to cause diseases that are caused by smoking?

to diagnose these types of things.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  The problem with the cumulative issue is this, Judge. They're going to and they have made the argument that the witnesses who have thus far discussed addiction are not properly trained in the areas to assess addiction.

THE COURT:  This is not a medical doctor either.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  This is the point, Judge.  He deals with nicotine addiction �

THE COURT:  Are there other doctors who you can ask that question?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. FURR:  Dr. Soloway.  Dr. Bernsley.

MR. GDANSKI:  Wait one second.  Dr. Soloway never discussed addiction.  The word never came out of his mouth and that's not accurate. They're attacking Dr. Bernsley and saying he's not an addiction expert.  There is plenty of

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, no, the psychologist treats the smoker so as to give them a chance to avoid their disease.  You have to know what the disease is, he has to teach what the disease is,

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Okay.  Tell us what, if anything, you tell smokers related to what will happen if they don't stop smoking, please.

A    Smokers are very intelligent and they know nowadays that it's a dangerous product.  I don't think that was true historically and I don't think that Mr. Shulman believed that.  So the fact that he thought they wouldn't sell it if it was unhealthy is a serious problem because it gave him false reassurance and made, you know -- and made him think that he had taken care of a problem already.  So I think today it's a different story.  I think people now know, people know that's a dangerous product mostly.

Q    All right.  Let's just look at this slide 36.  I've taken the heading off.  Can you tell the jurors, if things like the amount of smoking, and we're taking a composite of his smoking history, say 30 cigarettes a day for 40 years, which would be almost half a million cigarette in a lifetime, 438,000 cigarettes in a lifetime, if you average on the low end of eight to ten puffs per cigarette, that's 3 1/2 million lifetime exposures to the toxins

explain to your smokers they're undergoing as part of

their ongoing dependence?

A    I'm not trying to scare them to death.  I'm trying to help them quit smoking.  They're already scared to death.  They're already desperate.  That's how they find me.  They're desperate to quit and they don't know how to quit.  They're worried about this already when they come to me.

Q    Do you have to interact with them in that regard?

A    They're concerned about their health. They're worried about it and they don't know what to do about it.

Q    How do you teach them that the danger is in the excessive compulsive smoking that nicotine addiction drives, meaning a pack a day, 20 cigarettes a day, how do you teach them that that's where the danger is?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Do you teach them and do you counsel them that that's where the danger is?

Page 5601 they understand that this is dangerous and something

they don't want to do, but there's a disconnection.

It's called denial.  We've all heard about what

denial is.  It's a disconnection between the

intelligent smart brain that is worried about the

behavior and the part of the brain that is compelled

in the mid brain to continue and repeat this

experience.

And there is -- there's science now that

shows that the parts of the brain that inhibit and

control this behavior are actually damaged in

addiction, that there's less brain matter there.  So

there's actually a biological basis for this �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, the

question was, do you teach them and do you

counsel them, that's where the danger is?  I

move to strike this as nonresponsive.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Do you teach them and

counsel them about their medical consequences to

try to help them to quit?  It's perfectly

responsive, Your Honor.

Cancer Institute, the American Heart Association, the

National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer

Society, the World Health Organization, the National

Health Service, the Mayo Clinic, the Surgeon General,

have you studied and learned about all these

different sources of information on nicotine

addiction?

A    I think the amazing thing is that there's a consensus among all these major health institutions that nicotine is a powerfully addicting, life-threatening, dangerous drug.  They all agree on that.

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Bolstering.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer given.  It's not of

any evidentiary value. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

These concepts, can you tell the jurors

within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty

your understanding of the intense severity of

nicotine addiction?  Is it all of these items here on

this slide?

A    Yes.

Q    It's very addictive, powerfully addictive, highly addictive, is this what the current science is?

A    There's no question about it.

Q   Similar to the addiction by using drugs as heroin and cocaine?

A    Yes.

Q   As addictive as heroin and cocaine?

A   People who go into rehab for those drugs say it's harder to quit smoking often.

Q   You've treated folks like that and they've had more trouble quitting smoking than getting off of heroin?

A    Yes.

Q   So does nicotine addiction affect folks emotionally as well as physically?

A    It does.  It creates a kind of insecurity,

talking about this before.  That belief that they

can't live without it is part of what drives the

compulsive behavior.

Q    Define what you mean by compulsive

behavior, please?

A    The person has a strong preference to do

this versus not doing it.  There's pressure on them

that has a biological basis to repeat an experience

that they've learned is a powerfully -- it releases

powerful chemicals in the brain that are really

designed to help us with things like eating and

mating, things like that, those chemical messages get

hijacked by the nicotine and produce a powerful

pressure on the person to repeat the behavior over

and over again.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  So � and let's just show this Number 34 real quick, please.

MR. FURR:  We're going to object to that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  We have a ruling on this.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, just to be clear, you also told us we could take up the sourcing �

MR. GDANSKI:  The model has been removed. It's been removed.  On the one we're showing it's been removed.  We just didn't have time to print it all out again.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Did you kill the sound?

Q    I'm going to have you narrate it then, please.

A   What happens when you take a cigarette because of inhalation is, it goes quickly into the brain, very quickly in seconds, that's part of what makes it so addictive.  It goes into the cells.  It fits into the cells like a key into a lock.

There are cells in the brain that are designed for acetylcholine that nicotine fits right into.  That's what it's showing, how the lung is rich with blood that goes right into the brain, the cells become adapted to it.  That's where it fits into the receptor of the cell, the nicotine.

Q    Is this actually a brain cell?

A    It looks like it.

Q    Is it the dendrite, that part of the body, the brain cell?

A    Right.

Q    Go ahead.

A   What happens with nicotine is so powerful

Q    What is happening?  Are these the release of neurotransmitters caused by the nicotine?

A    Yes, dopamine.

Q    Okay.

A    Most of the nicotinic receptors in the mid brain release dopamine.  That's a big concern with nicotine researchers.

Q    All right.  So then you've got the dendrite, you have the axon, and these are the drugs going into the receptors in � the nicotine receptors in the brain?

A    Right.

Q    What happens to the nicotine receptors in the brain over time when the pediatric brain, for instance, is exposed to nicotine?

Page 5609 normal pleasures.  So because they release two to ten

times more dopamine than you would normally get

because you achieved something -- dopamine is

something that's goal oriented.  If you got a good

mark on a test, you'd get a little dopamine.  If you

accomplished something that you were proud of, you

would get a little dopamine.

But if you got two to ten times more

dopamine just for smoking a cigarette, it tends to

damage that system.  Then when you don't have it, you

can't get the normal pleasures.  That's what's called

withdrawal.

Q    All right.  Continue with that, please.  So what happens when the nicotine receptors are empty? If Mr. Shulman, for instance, is trying to be abstinent for a few hours from cigarettes, what happens?

A    It's more extreme for some people than other people, but they're hungry.  He talks about the hunger and that's called nicotine hunger.  It's part of the craving.  It's difficult to describe what it is, but it's an overbearing, overwhelming craving to use the substance that in this case the product which is the cigarette.

Page 5610 So with regard to this concept that

nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason

individuals persist in using tobacco products and

this persistent use contributes to many of the

diseases from smoking, is this something you're

familiar with as the current understanding of

science?  Is this something you work with in your

mind, that you know about?

A I don't think the people would smoke a cigarette that didn't have nicotine in it. They would reject it.

Q    In your assessment of Mr. Shulman, were you able to make a determination one way or the other as to whether nicotine addiction was the fundamental reason why he persisted for � smoking cigarettes for approximately 40 years of his life?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative multiple

times already within this examination, Your

Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a completely

different question, Judge, with all due respect. THE COURT:  I'll overrule it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    I don't think he was doing it because he

Page 5611 was having fun with it.  I think he wanted to get rid

of it as a teenager.  That's one of the striking

things, he wanted to get rid of it then, and it went

on for decades and decades, not because he was having

fun or enjoying it but because he was addicted to it

and he felt compelled to do it.  That's why it

persisted over the decades.

Q    So let's go to number � slide Number 21. I want to talk specifically about Bob's addiction and give us a little bit of the specifics that lead you to the conclusions you've given.  We started and got partially through his life talking about his biography of smoking.  You got a little bit along the way.  We'll continue with that now.  Can you do that?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  So the key features of addiction, we're looking at slide 21.  Explain to us what this means, how you interface with this.  Please explain this to the jury.

A    Two of the primary criteria that are there are really some of the most reliable ways to predict how somebody will do when you try to quit smoking. One is the time to the first cigarette.  Nicotine researchers are very, very involved with that concept.  It predicts how well someone is going to do

Page 5612 when they quit.

In this case with Mr. Shulman, he said he

started smoking before he even got out of bed, before

he was even awake he'd have three or four cigarettes

with his morning coffee, it's clear that he met that

criteria.

Q    You focused right in on this, this one, time of first cigarette.  What do you know that the science tells you about the predictive power of that particular single symptom in assessing the severity of dependence of a smoker like Mr. Shulman?

A    I think it's the best way to predict what will happen in a month.  It's hard to predict more than that.  A month out, if somebody does that, they're going to have a much harder time quitting. That's established, you know --

Q    Is this a validated criteria?

A    Yes.

Q    Tell the jurors what that means.

A    Well, it's been shown to correlate with other behaviors, other kinds of things like whether you quit or not in a month.  So it's -- it correlates with other things.  That's part of what validation

means

Is it part of what's called the Fagerstrom

Page 5613 Test of Nicotine Dependence?

A    Yes.

Q    The jurors have heard some of that.

A    You get three points for that right off the bat.  So if I saw that and I saw that he smoked 30 cigarettes or more a day, he's got six points.  He's way along in getting a high score on the Fagerstrom. I know right away he's going to score high on the Fagerstrom.

Q    Is there another battery?  You mentioned three, the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, the DSM and the Fagerstrom �

A    Yes.

Q    � are different instruments for assessing nicotine dependence, the severity of it, propensity of smoking when he gets sick.  What about is there another one called the heaviness � what is that?

A    The Heaviness for Smoking Index.  It's really a shortened version of the Fagerstrom.  It basically said that two items in Fagerstrom have a lot of predictive validity, and the two items are, how many cigarettes you smoke a day and the time of the first cigarette.  Just those two items, if you got that information, you would extract a tremendous amount of knowledge about how addicted the person

was

Q    All right.  Has that been peer reviewed and statistically tested and published many, many, times in the scientific literature, that's the kind of stuff you study?

A    It's been around.  It's a finding that's very, very reliable.  It's been around for a long time.

Q    Is it in the armamentarium of any responsible smoking cessation expert to use?

A    Yes, it would be an oversight not to look at that.

Q    Keep going through this, did Mr. Shulman meet the criteria for time of the first cigarette?

A    There's no question about it.

Q    How about persistent daily use, was he a regular smoker of cigarettes daily?

A    He couldn't go for very long without them.

Q    What's the significance of that?

A    That's -- the example that struck me in reading through the depositions was when he ran out of cigarettes, he had no cigarettes and he couldn't stand it anymore, he called somebody that had a pharmacy and he asked the guy to open the pharmacy so that he could get a cigarette at 10:00 at night.

Page 5615 That's a very unusual story that you -- you

don't hear that story often with somebody called

tobacco use disorder.  Maybe for a heroin addict or

something like, that someone with heroin abuse, but

that's a pretty extreme reaction for this disorder.

Q    All right.  Did you see other examples in Mr. Shulman's historical behavior that corroborated some of these extreme examples you're explaining and offering to the jury?

A    Well, I thought his getting up in the middle of the night was one.  Only about 15, 16 percent of smokers smoke as soon as they get up in the morning, so that's also somewhat rare.

The fact that he asked the doctor for help as a teenager, he wanted to quit and couldn't do it as a teenager and asked the doctor, that's an unusual story.  I would be listening to that story.

Q    Was there anything in 1936 that doctors had with regard to understanding that cigarettes were even addictive or how to treat it �

A    He didn't have anything in his black bag for Mr. Shulman.

Q    Okay.  The amount smoked per day, did he have features that were consistent with addiction because of the amount he smoked per day?

Page 5616 A    Well, I think one of the things I looked

for is, does it increase over time?  What is the

pattern?  Called the progression of the addiction.  I

found he smoked solidly a pack around 21, that he

went up in young adulthood to 25 to 30 cigarettes,

that he was moved up to two packs a day, even before

he switched to the filters.

Then after he got the filters he was

frustrated because he couldn't get the nicotine out

of it.  He had more than two packs a day, and he said

it.  He said it in the medical exam that he had with

Dr. Hoge.

Q    How long did Mr. Shulman smoke based on your synthesis of these records, please?

A    Well, I found this a source of confusion. Some of the medical records says he stopped in '75, one says '72, one says '82.  Maybe he smoked 40 years.  In his deposition he says he didn't quit until the mid '80s, the late '80s.  One thing that occurs to me is that he had trouble, he couldn't smoke in the movie theaters, that didn't happen until I think the late '70s or '80s.

Q    Do you mean the banning of smoking in the movie theaters?

A    That's when they banned smoking.  He was

Page 5617 having trouble with that.  He had to leave.  He said

he left his wife there, he couldn't remember the

plot, and that was a problem, she was unhappy about

that.

Q    Do smokers quit and relapse?

A    That's the most likely outcome of trying to quit smoking is a relapse.

Q    All right.

A    Only 3 percent of them make it, so if � basically a lot more people than that try every year, many more people.  In fact, surveys over the years have shown that 75 percent of smokers want to quit and only 3 percent do.

Q    Okay.  So let's look at some of � did he meet all these criteria?

A    I believe so.

Q    Are there any other criteria that he didn't meet or that were equivocal?

A    I didn't think so.  I went through all of the measurements and I thought that he met the criteria.

Q    Whether he smoked and quit in the mid '70s or the early to mid '80s or even as late as the '90s, according to some observers, does he meet these criteria?

A

Yeah

Q    Now, let's look at � you used the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.  That was one of the formal diagnostic tools you used?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  Let's look at that.  I don't know if the jurors have actually seen what this test is.  Let's show it to them.

All right.  So who is Fagerstrom?  What is Fagerstrom?

A    Carl Fagerstrom is one of the � sort of the granddaddies of the field in the dependence field, and he developed this test and he has become very well known for this test.  He is I think from Sweden.  He sent me materials.  He's been very kind about it over the years in terms of corresponding. This test is the most widely used assessment for nicotine dependence in the field, in the field of nicotine dependence.

Q    In recent years did he actually sell his nicotine gum company to R.J. Reynolds.

A    I've heard that.  It's a little disheartening to me but I have heard that.

Q    With regard to this test, though, is this still a widely used test?

the field.

Q    Does Reynolds even use this test to this

day?

A    I don't know what they do.  I don't spend much time on their web site.

Q    All right.  Fair enough.  Let's look at what the features of this test are, please.  Can you tell us what they are?

A    The first one is, how soon after you wake up in the morning do you take your first cigarette? That has been, you know, one of the tried and true criteria of this whole thing.  It's a way to predict what's going to happen when somebody tries to quit.  Of course he scores the highest within five minutes.  He gets a three.

The second one is, do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it's forbidden?

Well, yes.  Especially in later times he avoided restaurants.  He avoided movies.  He avoided even visiting family members that he loved.  He would leave quickly because he was so anxious to have a cigarette.  So I gave him a one for number 2.

up'

I couldn't get an answer to that.  I gave him a zero.  I thought basically he was saying he didn't have a preferred cigarette. Q    Okay. A    So he got a zero on that one.

How many cigarettes a day did you smoke? It progressed over time, and I think it's fair to give him a 31 or more based on the historical record of where the addiction progressed and where it went. So I gave him a three, so that takes us up to seven.

Then do you smoke more frequently during the first hours after awaking than the rest of the day?

No.  The answer was no.  I gave him a zero. Because he smokes evenly throughout the day.  That's what he told me.  I think when I spoke to him.

The last one is, do you smoke even if you are so ill that you're in bed for most of the day?

The answer was, yes, he does. Q    Is that significant?

A    Yes.  It's significant.  A lot of people � sometimes people are able to quit when they get sick because they just don't feel like smoking.  Even though how sick he was, he still felt like having a

Q    Is there some crossover between these different batteries, the different tests, the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, the Heaviness of Smoking, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the Fagerstrom, is there some overlap?

A    Well, I think the most important questions in this, the Fagerstrom, are not in the DSM.  That's one of the things that it gets -- most of the tobacco nicotine researchers don't use the DSM.  Some of the epidemiologists do, people that study large groups of people, but most of the researchers don't because it doesn't cover the most important factors here.  It covers other things.

Q    I'm thinking about this business about do you smoke when you're ill.  That's in the Fagerstrom, but it also talks about, do you smoke when you're in bed?  Is smoking in bed something of import to the � to researchers and clinicians like yourself in assessing, for example, problems with nicotine dependence?

A    Smoking in bed is one of the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the DSM, which is the psychiatric manual.  They say specifically smoking in bed is a way that you score one of their

Page 5622 criteria.  It's pretty clear that he smoked in bed

more than once a week.  When -- one of the things he

said about it made me think about how severely

addicted he was.  He said, I didn't intend to smoke

in bed, but I did.  I needed to and I did.  That's

how my mind worked.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer given by the witness.

It's been struck from the record. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Based on what you were able to derive from the record from Mr. Shulman, who you assessed like you would assess any patient, right?

A    I used the same skills that I have in the way I think about these problems.

Q   Do you have to assess � when you assess patients, do you assess such things when you get the story of things like if they're smoking in bed?

A    Well, I'm interested in everything.  I'm interested in that.

Q    Okay.  And by the way, with regard to smoking in bed, what is the � what do you know the science shows with regard to the percentage of folks, addicted folks, the heavy smokers, what is the

Page 5623 percentage that also smoke in bed?

A    Maybe about a third, that's the latest I've seen.

Q    Okay.  Is that � first of all, is it dangerous to smoke in bed?

A    Of course it's dangerous.  The fire departments are always worried about that.  He also did burn holes in furniture.  He burned holes in furniture and clothes because he fell asleep and burned his shirt sleeves.  That's in the record. That's an unusual thing you hear.  That's not something you hear every day, people burning holes in furniture.  That's somebody who's got a big problem with this.

Q    Smoking in bed, a risk of falling asleep and starting a house fire, is that conceptually what you understand to be smoking in a situation where it could be dangerous?

A    Well, it's defined -- it is the criteria they give in the DSM.  To me that's what it means. That's what a risky behavior would be for tobacco use disorder.  That's what it looks like.

Q    Were there jobs that Mr. Shulman couldn't take in his younger life because of smoking and dangerous situations?

Page 5624 A    Yeah.  That's another thing that really

jumped off the page at me, that he turned down a job

during the depression, when money was tight, because

the whole day he couldn't get away.  It was a gas

station and he was going to be near gas.  He knew

that it could blow up.

He didn't take a job and that's unusual.

That's unusual to give up a work opportunity when

money is tight, when there's a depression on, you

know.  So I think one of the criteria there is

interference with work.  He met that criteria in my

view.

Q    Along those lines, cigarettes can be bought in the United States in the '30s all the way up to today, right ?

A    I believe it's a legal product.

Q    So you don't look for � unlike an illegal drug like heroin or cocaine, does nicotine include things like robbing stores or stealing or doing antisocial things to get product?  Is that a proper feature for cigarette and nicotine dependent smokers?

A    No.  I think that would be the wrong way to, you know, look at this.  Maybe for heroin people would break in and steal, but people don't typically do that -- he did take cigarettes from his parents

it, but that's a different story.  He wasn't breaking

and entering to get cigarettes.

Q    So just doing � I guess you had to do this historically, but historically doing the Fagerstrom in retrospect of Mr. Shulman, what did you score him?

A    I gave him an eight based on exactly what I'm telling you.

Q    Let's go to the next slide 36 to show what the different degrees of dependence are based on the Fagerstrom test, when you score it, what it means. Is this what Fagerstrom says the different scores portend with regard to the level of dependence?

A    Exactly.  It's not just because he says it, it's because there's research behind it, but he does say it.  I think one of the things I tell my students is, there's a big difference between the very low dependent smokers in the bottom 20 percent and the very strongly dependent smokers in the top 20 percent that those people really have very different problems.  If you lump them together, you're going to confuse people and you're going to confuse yourself.

Q Okay. You do emphasize that. Do you feel strongly in your practice that there's � that these different kinds of degrees of dependence are

Page 5626 important and significant in the way folks smoke and

understanding what it's going to take to help them

get over their addictions?

A    Yeah.  I think as I was trying to explain, some people, it's not that hard to help them.  Half of the people don't even have nicotine withdrawal syndrome.  The people in the upper half of this chart, yeah, they struggle with it for a variety of reasons, but I think it says there they might have some difficult withdrawal symptoms but they can manage it on their own and so on.

But when you're talking about the top 5 percent, which is where I would put Mr. Shulman, it's talking about a small group with extreme dependence, chances to give up are small.  And they'll have smoking-related disorders, most will have smoking-related disorders, which he had.

Q    So you put him in, you said the top 5 percent of smokers in terms of the level of how extreme his dependence was?

A    Well, that's what the eight means, according to Fagerstrom.  I would do it as well.

Q    Now, Mr. Shulman ultimately did give up smoking?

A    Yes.

Page 5627 Q    So does the fact that you ultimately do

give up smoking and you escape the addiction and

quit, what does that say with regard to the period of

years that you were dependent?  Does that erase it

and mean you weren't dependent during those periods

of years?  Would that be accurate?

A    I think this is a really interesting point. Just because you're addicted doesn't mean you can't quit.  It's just much harder for you than it might be for other people.

So, you know, just because you decide to do something and try to quit doesn't mean that you're going to be able to do it.  If you decide you're going to play the piano and don't know how, doesn't mean that you're going to be able to play Chopin Etudes, or play something that is very complicated when you can't read music.

Some people have a much higher bar to get over than other people.  It doesn't mean they can't get over it.  He quit either when he was -- in '75, '85, or '95, we don't know when, but he did quit.  We know he did quit.  So unfortunately he also got a disease from it.

Q    Well, did you see evidence in the record as to whether cancer is what cured his smoking?

Page 5628 A    Well, there's some indications that that's

true

Q    Now, so let's go to � so it looks to me like starting at four to five you've got over average dependence, six to seven you've got strong dependence and withdrawal, eight to ten you've got the small group with extreme dependence, and what is the total score in this interpretation, I guess it's Exhibit 40?  How does that fit into Mr. Shulman, please?

A    Score over seven your level of dependence is high, you aren't in control of your smoking.  It's in control of you.  When you make the decision to quit, you may want to talk to a doctor.  Well, this is now a more modern approach.  We didn't � you know, mostly people aren't going to their doctors unfortunately.

Q    But is this � why is this therapeutic?  In other words, obviously � it appears that for folks that score over seven they're going to be told or taught, your level of dependence is high, you're not in control of your smoking, it is in control of you. That's not for you, the clinician, that's what the patient hears when they score high?

A    That's the message that you give the

Q    Why?

A    Because you're trying to say that they need some kind of outside help.  It may be a doctor.  It may be -- they have a form of Alcoholics Anonymous for smokers called Nicotine Anonymous.  It may be anything you can do to try to help yourself.  You might need some support by people in your community. You might need anything to help you quit.

Q    Are there drugs that exist now that didn't exist years ago when Bob was deep in his period of tobacco dependence?  Are there modern advances that weren't even available to Bob in early years?

A    Well, there are some very good drugs that have come on, probably -- I don't really have exactly the dates, Chantix I think is a drug that came out in the 2000s, maybe 2006.  Wellbutrin is another drug that's marketed, as Zyban, that's a very, very good drug for smokers.  I don't know if it would have been available for him in the period that he was trying to quit.

Q    The types of things that you saw him do when he tried to quit, did he meet the criteria of what you considered to be withdrawal?

A    Well, I was also struck by that, that this

Page 5630 was an extreme form of nicotine withdrawal that

really had all of the earmarks of a depression.  The

criteria in the DSM for nicotine dependence followed

very closely the criteria in the DSM for depression.

It's a very interesting thing.  People don't put

those two things together very often.

He seemed to have a terrible kind of

depression when he -- he had strained -- his head

hurt.  His body hurt.  His arms were like elastic.

He had a very difficult form of deep depressed

feelings and despondency that reminded me of a

clinical depression.  There seems to be an overlap

there.  There is an overlap between nicotine

withdrawal and clinical depression.  That's I think

what happened when he tried to quit.

Q    How long was he able to � did he try to quit with any frequency?

A    He said he tried dozens of times to quit.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Were you able to determine from the record and come to a conclusion as to whether or not there appeared to be attempts for this man to quit?

Page 5631 record.  I think that he -- not from him -- he said

that he tried, and what I believe about the situation

is that he tried and became discouraged.  When he

became discouraged after trying many, many times to

quit and having this terrible experience with

clinical depression or whatever the withdrawal

symptoms were with him, that he gave up, that he

entered into the failure syndrome and was afraid to

try.  Every time his family confronted him about it

he said, I tried, I tried, I tried, I don't think I

can do it.  I know I can't do it.  I can't do it.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  Hearsay

again.  I'll move to strike.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are the signs and

symptoms of evaluation, Your Honor, necessary

toward this clinician to make an assessment of

the patient would be my argument.

THE COURT:  Do you want to approach?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Here is my objection, Your

Honor.  My objection is -- I didn't object when

he said, my opinion is that he tried, okay.  He

can do that.  But then when he starts reciting

what Mr. Shulman said, that's pure hearsay.  So

THE COURT:  He's not a party opponent.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  But it's to make someone to make an assessment.  This man in order to make an assessment has to work off of what he's being told.  He doesn't have an x-ray.  He doesn't have a blood test.  He only assesses what the patients tell him.  Those are the diagnostic tools.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) THE COURT:  I've sustained the last

objection.  The last answer that the witness

gave is struck from the record. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q How long, from your review of these records, was Mr. Shulman able to go without a cigarette during his quit attempts, please?

A    The longest before he finally quit that he reported was 14 months.

Q    14 �

A    Not 14 months, 14 hours.

Q    Understood.

A    The day is getting long here.

Q    Sure.

Of what significance are durations of attempts to quit that only last on the order of hours?  How long does nicotine last when you go through that and puff the nicotine and it shoots to your brain, how long does it last?

A    It has what's called a half life of about two hours, that means half of it is gone in two

Page 5634 hours.  Any time in the first 24 hours the nicotine

symptoms could begin, but for severely addicted

people, they can't even get a day.  So actually

that's a very important diagnostic criteria if you

can't get a day quitting, it's probably because

you're in that 5 percent group.  You can't get that

much time.  You break down before you can get any

time .

Q    Did you see that in Mr. Shulman's case he was never able to go a full 24 hours without cigarettes during the period of time he was heavily addicted?

A    Yes.

Q    Were you able to determine whether or not he intended to try, he tried, he meant to try, he intended it?

A    I think throughout the record he says, I intended to do it.  I wanted to do it and I couldn't do it.  There was a disconnect in him.

Q    Did he try when he went boating?

A He went out boating for five or six hours and tried to quit smoking, and he developed what he called hunger for it, a nicotine hunger.

Q    What is nicotine hunger?  Is that a buzzword to you when you see your patients reporting

it?

A I think the craving can feel like hunger. It's hard to distinguish between actual craving and hunger and anxiety, those things are closely related.

Q    Did you see evidence in the record that he tried to quit when he was scuba diving?

A    Yes.

Q    What do you remember about that?  What was the evidence in the record that you draw out as important with regard to his addiction with regard to scuba diving, attempts to quit during scuba diving?

A    He was a very active guy.  He was trying to use the things that he did all the time as a way to quit, and I think one of the problems with the self-help culture around people quitting a lot of times they'll try ineffective techniques. MR. FURR:  Objection. MR. SCHLESINGER:  The witness is explaining

his answer and the scientific basis, Your Honor,

if it pleases the Court?

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  One of the problems with

ineffective techniques is people are trying to

control the smoking, they stall, they delay, and

the tension builds and builds and then it breaks

about willpower, and it ends up making the

situation worse.

So the ineffective techniques that people

use lead them into kind of a -- feeling

discouraged that they're not able to do it, that

they're never going to be able to do it.  In

fact, that's what he ended up believing, after

trying everything he knew how to try, he was a

very strong guy, a very self-willed guy, he

wasn't used to failure, but this thing brought

him down to his knees.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    What's the first thing he did when he came

up for air after he was done scuba diving?

A    I think he took a cigarette.

Q    Are these the kind of little specific

vignettes that you incorporate into your thinking

about your patients when you're having them tell you

their story?

the jurors, did he demonstrate that he was a �

successful in life or that he had control in other

aspects of his life, did you make a determination

Page 5637 about that as a psychologist?

A    Yeah.  I thought he was a pretty incredible guy and he built a business with several thousand employees.  He broke horses when he was a teenager. He did all these things.  He was a very successful energetic guy who was used to succeeding.

I think this really threw him.  I don't think he knew what to make of this.  I think he was bewildered, which is true for a lot of smokers who are having trouble quitting.  They don't understand it.  They intend to quit and then it doesn't happen. There's a disconnect there.  That's what impaired control is all about.

Q    Did he have problems in his home, social, family life because of his smoking?

A    I think it's really clear in the record from his courtship, his wife hated the cigarettes, and she didn't like his yellow fingernails and she didn't like the smell.  She was allergic it sounds like because she had problems with her eyes and her breathing.  She didn't like the secondhand smoke. She had a problem with it from the beginning.

She loved the man.  She hated the tobacco. She hated the addiction from the beginning.  And they fought about it.  She put signs up on the

conflict throughout what's been a 73-year marriage

apparently.

THE COURT:  We're going to take a �

Mr. Schlesinger, we're going to take a recess at

3:00, so wrap up your next set of questions in

the next five minutes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I will. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    I'm crossing across batteries, but is social impairment, are things like fighting with the family, for instance, did you see evidence in the records whether his wife fully screamed at him sometimes?

A    She screamed at him.

Q    Did you see evidence from him as to whether he wanted to please her, that he wanted to quit for her, did you make a determination that the family dynamic demonstrated that behavior in Mr. Shulman?

A    What I saw was a very loving family.  I see this a lot, that just because you love your family and you love your wife and you love your kids doesn't mean you can quit smoking.

Q    Did he have the failure syndrome?

Q    Is this kind of social tension one of the indicators or criteria that goes along with diagnosing the severe type tobacco dependence disorder?

A    Yes.  It's a diagnostic criteria in the DSM, arguing with your family and having conflict, it's an important indicater of being out of control and having social impairment.

Q    Was it present in Mr. Shulman?

A    There's no question about it.

Q    Did Mr. Shulman demonstrate to you any � from the record that you reviewed, did he demonstrate to you any sort of false senses of reassurance from the kinds of things he thought he was doing?  Let me strike that.

Can an addicted smoker still make choices?

A    I think every human being has choices. It's part of human dignity that we have choices that we can make.

Q    Did he make choices?

A    He did make choices.  He tried to quit on his own, which most smokers believe is their personal responsibility.  Even if they can't do it, they believe they're supposed to do it and take care of it

Page   5640 and  that's   what   he   did.      And  when  that   didn't   work

out, he chose the filters.

Q   Did he get a sense of false reassurance

from those filters?

A    Yes, he did.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Asked and answered.  Argumentative, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. FURR:  Move to strike the answer, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll strike the answer.  The jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q   Was it reasonable or unreasonable for a patient like Mr. Shulman to believe that the filtration process, that the filtering process is going to make the cigarette safer and allay the risks, if any?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A I think it's a brilliant idea. It makes perfect sense to me that a filter would get rid of the bad stuff.  It makes perfect sense.  Why wouldn't

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

Entertaining but leading. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Forget the entertaining.  What I want to know is this.  Is there anything scary about cigarettes in the era that Mr. Shulman was smoking and addicted and dependent, was there anything on the order of magnitude that would clue him in to some sort of terrifying lethal danger that could give him better motivation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and

argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    When it comes to the recognition of danger, recognition of a threat to health, in what you do for a living, is that important when it comes to cigarettes?

Page 5642 A    Well, yes.  I mean, I think we want to get

people in touch with the hard edge of reality, so

they can interact with reality in a more effective

way.

Q    Were you able to determine what

Mr. Shulman's conceptualization of the risks or harms

of smoking were in those first 20, 30 years of his

smoking behavior?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  This

has been covered multiple times, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  I think we're about

ready for a break.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  We're going to take a 20-minute

recess.  We're only going to go to 4:30 today.

So the jury should not talk among yourselves

about the case.  You shouldn't talk to anybody

else about the case.  You shouldn't do any

independent investigation and you should not go

on any social web sites or use any electronic

devices about the case.  Thank you.

(Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Did you say you wanted

to do some voir dire now?

MR. FURR:  I would like to.

THE WITNESS:  Excuse me, is this a chance for me to go to the restroom?

THE COURT:  No.  You're being questioned now.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  I'd like to go too, but I'm questioning you, so neither one of us can go. It's going to be short questioning.

THE COURT:  There's a method to my madness. By not letting you go to the restroom, the voir dire will take a shorter period of time than normal.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Seidman, my name is Jeff Furr.  I represent R.J. Reynolds.  We've never met before? A    No.

Q    A few questions.  During your direct examination � can you see the diagram, Your Honor?

The Court is still not getting that.

THE COURT:  I'm not getting it.

Q    Dr. Seidman, just a few questions on that. You were asked in direct examination, there came a point in time where Mr. Schlesinger was going to use this as a demonstrative exhibit, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Quickly, a little bit about your credentials.  You've been very forthcoming.  You're not a medical doctor, right?

A    That's correct.

Q    You're not a biochemist?

A    No, I am not.

Q    You're not someone who is qualified to diagnose lung cancer; is that fair?

A    I don't diagnose lung cancer.

Q   You don't diagnose bladder cancer?

A    No.

Q    COPD?

Q    The end point is lung cancer, right?

A    That's correct.

Q    Would this diagram change if the end point was bladder cancer?

A    I'm not in a position to answer that.

Q    Okay.  Well, let's talk about � what is PAH in the first box?

A    I don't know what it refers to.

Q    What is NNK?

A    I don't know what it's � I know that the carcinogens, I know there are 69 of them in a cigarette, but I don't know specifically what those things refer to.  It says other carcinogens, so they must be carcinogens.  It says it right there.

Q    But you don't know what PAH and NNK are?

A    There are 69 carcinogens in a cigarette.  I don't know all of them.

Q    How are those carcinogens metabolically activated?  This yellow arrow, describe biochemically what transpires there for us.

A    I can't really do that.

Q    Could you explain to us biochemically what persistence miscoding is?

A    No.

A    I think that's where the cancer is, but I don't know much more than that.

Q    I'm talking about this line down � not on the lung cancer line.  On the line coming off, what is apoptosis, the off ramp there from persistent miscoding?

A    Yes.

Q    You've used it before, haven't you?

A    Yes, I've seen it before.

Q    Are we asking you to explain any of the metabolic pathways or the poly-aromatic hydrocarbons or the Dioxy Nucleic acid or any of those things? We're not asking you to explain any of those things, are you?

A    No.  I hope not.

Q    All I want to know is, can you use this as a demonstrative to help the jury understand that the beginning point is nicotine addiction and the end point, through these processes, is lung cancer, and that's a well-known scientifciple?

A    I didn't think there was anything of a debate about whether smoking causes lung cancer.  I thought that was established.

For purposes of demonstrative use, all I was trying to find out from you is, what did you want to do with this board?  Tell the judge what you wanted to do with this board.

A    If somebody wasn't smoking, they're not going to get the lung cancer.

Q    Okay.

A    Because smoking is the thing that happens that ends up with them having lung cancer because it's full of carcinogens.  It has 69 carcinogens in it.  That's why the Surgeon General is making a chart like this, to show exactly in more detail, than someone like me, who is not a cancer specialist, would know.

Q    What does it start with?  Nicotine addiction?

A    Nicotine addiction.

Q    It says here:  Scheme linking nicotine addiction and lung cancer.

By the way, is nicotine addiction also

Q    So for demonstrative purposes, is there anything else you wanted to show this jury besides the fact that through this series of metabolic changes, nicotine addiction leads to cigarette smoking, which eventually causes lung cancer?  Is there anything else you wanted to do with that? A    No.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, with all due respect, I've been in a bunch of these trials, Mr. Furr has been in a bunch of these trials. This chart has been used over 100 times in Court.  Nobody ever asks what PAH or NNK means or what DNA adducts are.

All they try to do is a show a demonstrative to connect the concept of nicotine addiction as a cause of smoking cancer.  That's the only reason I would use it. I wasn't even going to ask him the specifics about that.

If Mr. Furr wants to ask him what those things mean, I have no problem with it.  But I would suggest it is appropriate to use it for brief demonstrative purposes.

jury?

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain this objection.  You are not going to be able to use this demonstrative with this witness.  You might be able to use it with another witness, but not this witness.  He doesn't have enough knowledge of it.  It's misleading to the jury.  Even if Mr. Furr wanted to do this, even if Mr. Furr wanted to try to impeach the witness with it, I would not allow it because I believe it's misleading to the jury.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    From the record evidence that you digested, what were Mr. Shulman's parents' reaction to finding out he was smoking, going along with the social interactions, things like that?  What was that reaction, please?

A    His mother seemed to be quite upset about it when he was a young teen.  There was -- some neighbor told on him, that he was smoking on the roof, and they were worried the tar would catch fire. The mother reprimanded him.

And some other people were giving him cigarettes in the neighborhood because he did some work for them, and she went to them and told them don't give him any cigarettes.  She disapproved of the whole thing.

Q    From the record evidence, did the parents voice any objection to his smoking because it may be harmful to his health?

A    No.  It wasn't a question of that, because in those days, it wasn't -- you know, that wasn't the

cost money, and she didn't think it was something for

children.  That's the way I got the story.  Smoking

wasn't something the children should be doing.

Q    All right.  Now, in terms of making a determination about reliance on tobacco company statements in advertising, did the record reveal enough information for you to come to that conclusion for Mr. Shulman?

A    His basic core belief was that they wouldn't sell it if it was harmful.

Q    What does that mean, when you say "core belief," as a psychologist dealing with nicotine dependent smokers?  What does that mean?

A    I think it was beyond his comprehension that an American corporation would sell something that hurt you if they knew it hurt you.  He couldn't believe that that could be true.

Q   Was that an unreasonable belief for patients in his age cohort during this period of years?

this expert's testimony.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Just so we're clear, is there actually a diagnosis in the medical record that you reviewed that diagnoses Mr. Shulman with a tobacco addiction syndrome?  Does that actually exist in this record?

A    Well, in the huge volume of it, nobody was really making that a focus of their clinical attention.  Nobody was really asking him about smoking from any of the records.

Of course, we don't have the records that go back before the bladder cancer operation.  But there was one record I saw that said COPD, secondary to tobacco abuse.

Q    All right.

A    That's the only thing I saw in the record.

Q    So I want you to look at this record.  It's 263.065.  It's in evidence.  I want to highlight that.  This is a September 30th � I'm sorry, September 20, 1995 oncology consultation.  This took place up in Maine.  This was around the time that he was diagnosed.

All right. So we talked about synonyms, things like that, you know, for tobacco cessation, professionals such as yourself, tobacco abuse.

the context of its use in this record how you would

interpret that and whether that's the equivalent of

tobacco addiction, nicotine addiction, or tobacco or

nicotine dependence?  Are they equivalent terms?

A    I think they're all interchangeable.

Q   Do you see here, when it's talking about a 40 pack year history of cigarette abuse, is that consistent from the social history with the ultimate principal diagnosis after he's got the bladder cancer as the number one, number two, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, secondary to cigarette abuse?

A    It's all there.

Q   Okay.  What does it mean?  What does that mean, that second principal diagnosis, when you read it and understand it, please?

A    That means if he didn't smoke, he's not going to get COPD.

Q All right. The secondary to, is that doctor talk for that which causes, is caused by something?

A    Yes.  Secondary means because you did that, you got this.

Q    In order to do what you do, do you need to know why it is that cigarette smoking is bad for you and why you should stop? A    Of course.

What �

Q    � that will befall them if they can't stop?

A    What I do know is there are 69 carcinogens in a cigarette, and it's responsible for all these illnesses.  I don't think that's under debate.

Q    Right.  It's not under debate in this case either.

For instance, haven't millions, tens of millions of people over the decades been able to escape their addiction?

A    Well, a lot of them get sick.  I mean, 60 million people have quit in the last 50 years, but 20 million people have died.  So for every three that quit, one has died.  For every one that died, a lot of people got sick.

I think a lot of people get sick in hospitals.  Hospitals are full of people.

THE COURT:  The jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You said that many folks, tens of millions have somehow or another escaped their addiction, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  Despite escaping the addiction, do they escape the consequences of the addiction?

A    Of course not.  I've had so many patients who quit smoking and then died subsequently from the smoking.

Q    With your patients � by the way, do your patients who you're treating for nicotine addiction, do they suffer in the face of that nicotine addiction?  In other words, does the smoking compulsion and the dependence, does it cause human suffering to the patient during the period of time

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Can you tell the jurors one way or the other, yes or no, whether the mere fact of being dependent in the grips of nicotine addiction causes patient suffering, please?

A    Of course it does.  People hate not being able to govern their own will, their own actions. That's one of the things that is really a huge problem with this, that they are out of control with their behavior, and they're disappointing people all around them.  I see this all the time, that people are concerned about them, love them, don't want them to do it.  And they want to quit themselves, and they don't know how to put that � they intend to do it and they can't do it.  That's the basic hallmark of the impaired control that goes with addiction.

Q    Now, since you did talk about these formal batteries, let's look at the next one you scored Mr. Shulman on.  It's called a Hooked on Nicotine Checklist.  It's number 41 on my slide or 53 or � we seem to have different numbers.

show you the criteria and go through it quickly.

First of all, did he meet all of the

criteria necessary to find that he had suffered a

loss of autonomy over his smoking?

A    Well, not number two, because he --whenever he quit, we know he doesn't smoke now.

Q    Okay.  That's my inartful question.

Did he meet substantially a number of the criteria that demonstrated a loss of autonomy?

A    Yeah, I gave him a 9 on this because I felt that all of the other ones applied to him.

Q    All right.  Now, this is a standardized battery of tests?

A    Yeah.

Q    Has it been scientifically validated such that it has some reliability?

A    It has some reliability.  It has more and more validity.  It's come a long way.  There's a number of studies behind it now.

Q   Does it continue to get studied to add to

it?

A

Yes

Q    And what is inter-rater reliability?  What does that term mean, please, inter-rater reliability,

Page 5664 to a scientist such as yourself?

A Well, if two people do the same task, are they going to pretty much agree on what the outcome is, what they're looking at.

Q    So like a blood test, if the lab is doing the job right, and you get a SNAP 26 to find out what your hemoglobin and hematocrit and your sugar and your BUN and all those other things, should the blood test have inter-rater reliability?  If you took the blood test here or there, you should get the same outcome.

A    There's some variation, but it's supposed to be similar.  This is a different kind of thing. This is a paper and pencil test.

Q   Are these tests supposed to have that kind of scientific reliability?

A    Yes, they need to have some reliability.

Q    Inter-rater reliability?

A    It's a measurement.

Q    What I want to know is, inter-rater reliability, depending on who gives it, it should come out pretty much the same?

A    If somebody has experience working with smokers.  You can't have somebody who's never had any experience with smokers give any of these tests.

When you haven't used tobacco for a while

or when you have stopped or when you have tried to

stop smoking?

Number 7, did you find it hard to

concentrate because you couldn't smoke?

Eight, did you find it more irritable?  Do

you feel more irritable because you couldn't smoke?

Nine, did you feel a strong need or urge to

smoke?

And ten, did you feel nervous, restless or

anxious because you couldn't smoke?

Are you familiar with these?

A    Yes.

Q   How many of these, based on your rater

observations, how many of these criteria did

Mr. Shulman fulfill?

A    I felt nine of the ten.  I gave him a 9 on

this .

Q   Which one did you not score him on?

A    Number 2, because he had already quit.

Q   Okay.  Did you derive this from all of the

materials that you reviewed, the examination,

transcripts, and the deposition transcripts and what

have you?

A

Yes

Q    Okay.

A    All the totality of everything I read and I thought about and I reflected about it and that's what I used to score this test.

Q    Are you using knowledge, training, experience, expertise to bring to bear in offering our jury some of your thoughts and conclusions?

A    Right.

Q    Okay.

A    I don't really believe it's ethical to use this kind of test if you don't have specialized knowledge, training and experience in using these tests.

Q    It's not something that I should try to apply to figure out what's going on.

A    No.  People who are not in the field and have never saw a smoker, never tried to help a smoker, never had any training in the field shouldn't be doing this kind of thing.

Q    Is it a research tool?

A    Yeah.  There's research from it.

Q    Back when we first ever asked you to get involved with this, you had no experience with testifying in court at all, did you?

Page 5668 A    No.  I'd never been in a court actually.

Q    Did we supply you with a deposition of like

Dr. Benowitz to see what a nicotine researcher did

when he talked about this stuff in a courtroom case?

A    Yes.

Q    To give you some familiarity?

A    Yes.

Q    Did we actually turn you onto the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist?

A    That's true.

Q    You hadn't even used it?

A    No.

Q    Having been introduced to it by us lawyers who labor in these environments, have you since developed an interest in it insofar as the loss of autonomy, please?

A    Well, I've always been interested in this as a clinical matter, people's compromised autonomy, feeling that they can't � that they're not in control of their life, that they can't implement the decisions and the wishes that they have.  I'm interested in that in general, and this was -- I found this very interesting, very relevant to the whole problem of nicotine dependence.

To me it shows that � I've been in this

Page 5669 field all this time, and there are people and there

are researchers that I still don't know about.

Because there's vast literature of smoking.  You

can't know everything.  There's many, many tens of

thousands of studies.

Q    And you work on them all the time?

A    Yes.

Q    In the Journal of the Society for Research and Nicotine and Tobacco?

A    Yes.

Q    Journals such as Tobacco Control?

A    There are tons of journals, tons of articles, and -- but it's a fascinating field.  I'm glad I'm in it and I'm glad I can keep learning.

Q    When you scored him on this, you said you scored him 9 out of 10?

A    Yeah.

Q    What does it mean if he only scored 1 out of ten?  In other words, when you read the test results and you interpret it, what is the significance, if any, with regard to loss of autonomy if you score on any one of them, if a person answers yes to the question have you ever felt like you really needed a cigarette, what would that say about their autonomy all by itself over cigarettes?

Page 5670 A    That they've lost some little piece, they

have some diminished autonomy.  They're not able to

say I want to do this and just implement that.

There's a difference between what they intend to do

and wish to do and what they do, what they can do.

Q    With regard to this checklist, for instance, what does the score have to be for the patient to be told you have complete control over your smoking?

A    It has to be zero.

Q    So any one of these indicates some degree of diminished autonomy?

A    That's right, on the face of it.  And it predicts problems later for teenagers who take this test that they're going to have a harder time quitting later.

Q    The more questions that are answered in the affirmative on this test, does that say anything about the degree or severity of the loss of autonomy or control over smoking by the addicted smoker?

A    I think it does, but I'm not exactly sure how that scoring works with this.  But I think the more of them that you have, the stronger it is.

One of the things that they found out about it, which is really quite fascinating, is that it

Page 5671 correlates with how much you smoke.  So if you're a

low level smoker, you endorse just a few of those.

If you're a moderate level smoker, you endorse more.

And if you're a high level smoker, you endorse many

of them.

So it does now -- they've been able to show

that this measure actually corresponds to the level

of smoking that people have.

Q    Now, I want to show you this medical record.  I want to talk about some of the documentary record evidence in the case about quitting, because you said you got different pieces of data about when the actual quitting occurred with Mr. Shulman.

So here � and this is � I think this is as recent as January of 2014 with Dr. Brewer.  I think he went to see for a general checkup.  He was having some constipation problems.  It indicates here � and this medical record is in evidence.  It's 00680 on the Bates number.  It will be available to the jury.  It indicates he was a former smoker up to a pack a day, that he discontinued � D/C, is that discontinued?

A    Yes.

Q    Approximately � squiggly line means around � 1982, after 45 years of use.

Page 5672 Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Does that medical record correspond with some of the evidence you got from the observers, including Mr. Shulman himself, as to when he remembers quitting smoking?

A    Well, the totality of the evidence from him is that it would be much later than this.

Q    Who was it or what was it that you derive from the record was the final � was one of the impetuses to quit smoking?

Not according to his son and quitting, that cancer cured a smoker.  I don't want to go there.

With regard to anyone else in his family, where else did you see evidence that somebody got him to throw those cigarettes away, please?

A    There's a lot of testimony about his daughter-in-law, a woman named Yvonne, who he was very fond of.  She was one of these special kind of therapeutic people.  She encouraged him to quit because her father had died from smoking.  This is his daughter-in-law.  She was really able to kind of get through to him.  That's the way the testimony says it.  She convinced him that it was a dangerous product.  According to the testimony, he believed

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay.  We went

over this ten times here.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let me see here.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I can withdraw

that last part.

THE COURT:  It's withdrawn, and the last

portion of the answer is stricken then for the

record.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Focus on Yvonne.  Is this in the period,

the '70s and the '80s, and the '90s, where his love

and appreciation of Yvonne helped him try to quit and

throw away his cigarettes?

A    I believe it was in the '80s.

Q    Did you see that he cared for Yvonne?

A    That's certainly in the testimony.

Q    Do you study the interpersonal

relationships of your smokers to see who's against

it, who is for it, and who can be a support person in

helping the addicted smoker overcome the illness?

A    I was impressed that -- she was the kind of

person you would want to hire for a therapist.  She

Page 5674 was very good at connecting with him.  She was good

at instilling hope.  She was good at challenging his

beliefs.  She would be a good cognitive behavioral

therapist.

Q    Did it appear to you that her interaction, Yvonne, Mr. Shulman son's former wife, did have a meaningfully beneficial therapeutic effect on Mr. Shulman and his ability to quit cigarettes?

A    I think so.  It's still difficult to know exactly when he quit, whether it was '75, '85 or '95.

Q    Does that go back to you quit for a while and then you relapse?

A    It could be that.  It's very difficult to tell from any of the medical records, because none of them asked follow-up questions or really got that into it.

Q    I want to ask you about that.  Let's go to this composite board.  I've used this before.  All these records are in evidence.

MR. FURR:  We haven't seen this. MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are all in

evidence.  We used this in opening.

MR. FURR:  Take it down.  We haven't seen

it.  Can we see it?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.

of records that are in evidence.

THE COURT:  No objection to the

demonstrative. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    I showed this to the jury in opening statement.  I want you to assume, Doctor, at or around the time of the '90s, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did you also derive from the record multiple references of a 1995 recollection recorded from Mr. Shulman that he had quit 20 years ago?

A    Yeah, yeah.

Q    Okay.  And then did you see corresponding subsequent records into the 2000s that it went to 30 years ago and 40 years ago that corroborated smoking cessation in the '70s?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  Tell us what you mean by directed questions, probing questions.  How do you incorporate this kind of information when you're assessing assisting smoking behavior in patients like Mr. Shulman, please?

just take the first thing somebody says to you.  You

might realize more things about it.  He did say in

the testimony that he just threw that out, he just

threw out the idea that he quit in '75.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me ask it this way. I withdraw and I will ask it --

MR. FURR:  Could I have the answer stricken?

THE COURT:  Sure.  By stipulation.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes.

THE COURT:  It is stricken from the record. The jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Knowing what you know about the way in which some of these records gather history, is this kind of history of a patient in the face of a life-threatening diagnosis, is that the kind of thing that typically meets with the probing detailed questions that someone like you may ask of a patient who you're seeing specifically for nicotine addiction?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE WITNESS:  Sustained

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You said probing questions.  What do you mean by that?  When you're taking care of a patient, you want to know about their smoking, do you probe?

A    Yeah, somebody comes in and they tell you I smoked ten cigarettes a day.  I say, well, we're going to give you some Nicorette gum or a patch based on what you told me, ten cigarettes a day.  Then they say, well, actually, Doc, it's 20 cigarettes a day. A lot of times people want to make themselves look good.  So I see that.  And then you ask a follow-up question and then they come out with it.  So that's a common thing.

Q    Is there embarrassment and/or guilt in smokers who are faced with smoking-related diseases attributable to smoking?

A There is no question about that. There is a tremendous amount of guilt and embarrassment. Now it's a very stigmatized thing to be a smoker?

Q    Did Mr. Shulman have embarrassment and guilt with his family about his smoking and his difficulty getting off of smoking?

A    I think he felt horrible about it. Throughout his marriage he was trying to -- he

Page 5678 couldn't solve a problem.  He couldn't solve a

problem.

Q    Even if we take this period of time and say his smoking went from the early to mid '30s, until the mid '70s, is 40 years of chronic, compulsive, excessive smoking due to nicotine addiction, is that a substantial smoking history that you see with long-term smokers who are suffering from dependence?

A    It's very substantial.  It's a very dangerous amount of smoking.

Q    I want to talk now about the other instrument or the other battery that you are familiar with.  It's called the Diagnostic Statistics Manual, Roman Numeral V.

A    Right.

Q    It came out in 2013?

A    Yeah.

Q    So that would be decades after anything having to do with the early years of Mr. Shulman's smoking, right?

A    Correct.

Q    Now, originally, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, did that come into being back in the '80s, with what's called the DSM-III?

A    Yes.  When I was training, it was coming

in

Q    Was that the first time that the psychiatric manual included a way to assess folks for tobacco dependence?

A    I'm not sure about that, because that was before I was into this.

Q    Okay.  But were there further iterations of the DSM?

A    Well, the DSM-IV certainly had a category of nicotine dependence.

Q    Did that have a long good run for many decades?

Yeah, I think it was '94.

Was it updated along the way?

It was updated along the way.

Did you use it?

I did use the TR or whatever it was

A revised.

Q    Okay.  So now there's the DSM-V.  Let's put up that slide to show a quick overview of what the diagnostic criteria are.  There's a lot of words in that one.  I loath to try to make our jurors experts in this, but let's get an overview of it so you can kind of explain what it is.

First of all, tell us what this is.

Page 5680 A    Okay.  You're supposed � you need two or

more to get the diagnosis of tobacco use disorder.

And it's broken down into different categories.

So for example, the first four questions are meant to address the issue of impaired control. Impaired control.  That's what they do.  They talk about did you smoke more over time.  Well, yes, he did.

Was there -- were there unsuccessful attempts to control it?

Yes, there were.

Was a great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain it or use it?

Well, yeah, he used � he smoked a lot.  He spent a lot of time doing that.  And even more than that, one of the things that I consider is that he was preoccupied with it.  It took up a lot of room in his thoughts.  Preoccupation is a very important part of addiction.  He had that.

Q    If you're smoking 240 to � I'm sorry, if you're smoking 200 minutes to 400 minutes a day, based on one or two packs a day, you're smoking somewhere between three and six hours a day, just actually smoking cigarettes.

A    That's a lot of time.

Page 5681 Q    Is that what they mean by, you know, a

great deal of time spent in activities necessary to

use tobacco?

A    You know, some of this is language that comes from other drugs, like heroin addiction.  And you have to be careful about it because it's not specifically tailored to nicotine so much.  So we have to � that's why you really have to have a framework for understanding how this applies to tobacco.

Q    The DSM-V, does it even really use the terminology "addiction"?

A    It has some reference to it.  It has it defined, but it's not � it's considered at the extreme end of this.

Q    Let me ask you what's not in it.  Is time to first cigarette one of the elements that's in it?

A    It's not there.

Q    You said that's one of the most critical features?

A    That's correct.

Q    Are there some limitations to using the DSM-V in isolation?

A    Yes.  That's why � it's not the main measurement that most tobacco researchers use.

Page 5682 Q    Has the DSM-V been specifically validated

using those terms we explained before for use in

nicotine addiction?

A    Well, there are work groups, there's study groups, and they try to put together data before they put these in there.  But they have to make decisions and that's why they -- for example, they put craving into this one.  Craving wasn't in the last one.  So craving is considered a very important thing.  It wasn't in the DSM-IV for all those years.  So they did listen to the data and do that here.

Q    Let me back up.  I just want to be specific.  We talked about the scientific validation of the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist and the Fagerstrom.

A    Yeah.

Q    I want to know, has the DSM-V been validated in that way?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  Just

asked and answered, the last question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I didn't get a responsive

answer.  I know usually that's what the

cross-examiner says.  I didn't hear the yes or

no, so I was trying to backtrack. THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q    I'm looking for a yes or no, whether or not the DSM-V has been validated for nicotine addiction, if you know.

A    Well, I don't think it's been correlated with some of these other measures, but it's new and I'm sure that people will try to do that.  But it doesn't have some of the other criteria.  That might be a problem.

Q    Does it still have some helpful factors to look at?

A    Yeah.

Q    Have you done that for Mr. Shulman?

A    Well, it has -- it really is � in terms of nicotine withdrawal, it has all of the validated symptoms.  So it's just in terms of some of the other things that are missing, like how many cigarettes a day you smoked and things like that.

Q    We're jumping ahead.  I want to cover nicotine withdrawal.  That is a whole separate page. This is not the nicotine withdrawal.  This is the diagnostic criteria.

The nicotine withdrawal part of the DSM has been validated.  Is that what you're saying?

A    I believe so.

Page 5684 Q    Okay.  Working with this � by the way, are

there warnings and limitations to the use of the

DSM-V, as you understand it, as a scientist and a

clinician, please?

A    The DSM is very clear that if you don't have experience in the area, you're not supposed to use it.  It's not ethical.  You're not supposed to use this as a cookbook for someone who doesn't have knowledge.

That's always true in diagnosis.  For anybody who is a responsible, ethical clinician, they need experience, training and knowledge in that area. If they don't have it, they're not supposed to be doing that.  The DSM is very clear about that.

Q Now, are there also provisos and warnings to how the DSM is used in a courtroom, in a lawsuit in front of a jury.

Does the DSM specifically contain cautionary statements about that?

A    I believe that there's � it's considered -- if you don't have specialized knowledge, you're not supposed to be using this.

Q    Is there a danger of misuse articulated by the DSM for use in the courtroom?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q   All right.  In any event, let's talk about the DSM as it relates to inter-rater reliability. Should it be applied in a way that it's going to be used properly with the best chance of getting accurate outcomes?  Should it be used in a way that promotes a high degree of inter-rater reliability?

A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  Meaning if you take the same smoker and you take 20 doctors or 20 folks that do this kind of work, that you should have a reasonable target where we're all going to the bull's eye?

A    They arrow should be going in the same direction.

Q   They're all going to the same or close to the same �

A    Yeah.

Q   Let's look at this.  As you started going through this, does he meet the criteria here in?  How did you score him?  I know you scored him on this. How did you score him with regard to all these different factors:  Continued tobacco use

Page 5686 despite having recurrent social or interpersonal

problems, arguments with others about tobacco use,

smoking in bed, recreational activities given up

because of tobacco use, continued despite having

knowledge of physical or psychological harm?  How did

you score him on these?

A    I felt, you know, based on my -- the

totality of the record and my experience, that this

is what tobacco use disorder looks like, the way

Mr. Shulman is presenting, that he had all these

factors.  And they specifically state them.

For example, the arguments with others, he had that.  His whole marriage, his whole courtship and marriage, and with his sons throughout the 1970s, it's clear in the record.

Did he smoke in bed?  He smoked in bed more than once a week.  He burned holes in furniture and in clothing.  It's clear on the face of it that he met those criteria.

In terms of tobacco use disorder, that's � this is what it looks like.  It looks like what Mr. Shulman has.

Q    How about the � let's go to the next one, which is the withdrawal criteria within the DSM.

Does the DSM criteria ask for withdrawal,

Page 5687 and then give you a set of withdrawal criteria?

A    Yes, it does.

Q   Okay.  So tell us about the features of withdrawal and whether you determined from the record that my client, Mr. Shulman � he's not here anymore this afternoon � but whether my client, Mr. Shulman, did display the classic evidence of withdrawal from the chemical dependency of nicotine addiction, please?

A    Well, you can imagine as I'm reading it I'm looking for this to see what it is.  It's all over the place in the record.  I felt that he met all of these criteria.  These are validated.  They're --people have looked at almost everything for nicotine withdrawal, all kinds of different symptoms.  These are the ones really that come through.  This really is the gold standard of withdrawal.

The overall DSM, most people in the field don't consider it the gold standard for assessing nicotine dependence.  It's one of the things that you do, but you shouldn't use it alone.

But this is the gold standard.  By any --there's no way that someone who has experience in this field is going to look at that and say he didn't have all those things.

Q    What part of the brain is affected by

nicotine addiction?

you're asking.

there's a disconnect in the brain.  There's evidence

now that the parts of the brain that control

behavior, that inhibit behavior, that help you to

inhibit behavior, are actually damaged by nicotine

dependence.  That there's gray matter, that there are

reductions in gray matter in those areas of long-term

smokers, the areas that are involved in behavioral

control.

Q    Is that your understanding of the current science?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    Do you work within that framework when you face whatever challenges you face even today in taking care of smokers?

A    I've known this for years, but I'm seeing it confirmed by some of the neuroscience, which is fascinating to me.

Q    Is it easier or harder nowadays to help folks quit smoking?  Even with all the new tools we have, is it easier, harder or the same?

Page 5690 Q    On the diagnostic criteria of withdrawal,

going back to this, it says 92.0, F17.203.  It's our

slide 47 from the DSM-V.  It talks about the various

elements of what constitutes a withdrawal syndrome.

A    Yes.

Q    Now, this is the sub category.  This is part of the detail of the criteria for the DSM substance abuse disorder of tobacco, right?

A    That's right.  This is the pharmacological part of it.  So it's broken into four different parts.  The last two address the pharmacology, the changes in the brain.

Q    You had said that the DSM-V criteria, going back to that first page, that of the 11 there, that you felt he met all 11 of them?

A    I do.

Q    Is that an opinion that's true within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty?

A    That's my opinion.

Q    Now, let's go now to the withdrawal criteria.  Take us through this and why is this applicable to and why does Mr. Shulman meet these criteria in your conclusion, please.

A    Well, everything I read -- every time he tried to quit, all these things happened to him.  He

Page 5691 was out in a boat one time, and he -- for a couple

hours, and he was trying to quit smoking.  He had

this kind of increased appetite and hunger and hunger

for nicotine too, all wrapped up together.

And there's a tremendous amount of evidence in the record about how depressed he would get, how despondent he would get.  All these kind of elements related to depression and mood changes and some strange things happened to him when he quit.  So I felt he met that.

He had trouble sleeping.  He was a middle of the night smoker to begin with.  He had more trouble sleeping when he tried to quit.  He had trouble concentrating.  He had trouble with anxiety. He would leave quickly when he'd come to visit people because he needed to get out and smoke, even after short periods of time.

This says that you can find these symptoms within 24 hours.  He got these symptoms much more quickly than that.  So the nicotine may have left his system even faster.

Q    Now, you did see that he smoked cigarettes, I guess brands from Liggett and from what was Lorillard, now Reynolds � Reynolds and Philip Morris.  You saw the Marlboro.

Q    All right.  So did each of the different manufacturer's brands contribute to cause his ongoing addiction during the years he suffered from it?

A    I think one of the problems with the slide is that you have to look at overall how it developed from a pediatric problem, throughout the lifecycle, to the point where he was smoking one after another because he couldn't get the nicotine out of the filters.  So it was different at different periods. And I think he did smoke constantly, but

Page 5694 that was � he was a big smoker his whole life.  He

was definitely a big smoker, got up to two packs.

But he got beyond two packs.  And I think he was

agitated, the record shows, more when he went to the

filters and he had trouble being without the

cigarette.

So all these things are very relevant.

Smoking in bed, smoking first thing in the morning,

those are hallmarks of this.  Getting up in the

middle of the night to smoke, his fingers and his

teeth were stained yellow, which his wife really

hated.  She loved him and she hated the cigarettes.

He would take cigarette butts out of the ashtrays and

smoke them.  He's probably not the only one who did

that, but it's also somewhat extreme, I think.

And he would take them off -- he would go

in the trolley car when he was a teenager, just to

show how hooked he was pretty early on, he would wait

for the people to come off or get on and throw their

cigarettes and he would take their live butts.

Q    Tell us about that, the trolley car stop. What did you detect from the record was important about his using cigarettes from the trolley car. Tell us about that.

A    When he didn't have money, he did odd jobs.

Page 5695 He was really good about trying to get out and get

work.  But if he didn't have money, he would go out

and wait for people to get on the trolley car.

They'd throw their cigarette out.  He'd grab the

cigarette and try to smoke it.

I thought that was a telling thing that

this guy was so addicted that that's what he was

doing.

Q    What is it when smokers carry extra packs around for fear of running out?  Did Mr. Shulman exhibit that?

A    Well, this is actually a very important point, that smokers start to feel very insecure about where they're getting a cigarette from.  That's in the record, that he felt very insecure about how is he going to smoke, where is he going to smoke, is he going to get a cigarette.  Because he felt he needed it to live.  It sounds strange, but I hear it regularly from addicted smokers.

Q    Does that have anything to do with fear, avoiding withdrawal symptoms, fear of having to contend with the symptoms of withdrawal?

A    I think that's part of it.  They're afraid they can't live without the cigarette.  The cigarette creates that much of a need in them, and then it

He was what was called a negative

reinforcement smoker.  If he didn't smoke, he felt

bad.  So he smoked to avoid that bad feeling.

Q    Is that related to when the proliferated

dopamine receptors are out of nicotine, that they

make you feel bad until you fill them up with more

nicotine?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Explain neuro biologically why that is.

A    Well, when the neurons and the receptors

empty out, the cells are screaming for more nicotine.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This is cumulative

of Dr. Henningfield, the video we just watched

and the earlier testimony today.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.

would sneak cigarettes in the bathroom when he was in

the hospital?

Honor.  If he doesn't remember this, it's

nonresponsive to the question.

THE COURT:  Objection.  Sustained.  The

last question is stricken from the record. Ask your next question. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    With regard to specific life behaviors that were poignant to you and important in terms of assessing his dependence, his nicotine addiction, you said there was something during the war years that was important.

A    He was working with precision equipment and they had big signs that said do not smoke.  They didn't want your eyes to get teary because it was very detailed work.  He would leave and go smoke.  He felt very guilty about it.  They were unauthorized absences on the job, and he was reprimanded by his supervisor for doing that.

That's another hallmark that is something that sticks out and says this guy has really got a loss of control.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    But for his addiction to the nicotine in

cigarettes, would he have been chronically exposed to

the disease-causing chemicals in the tobacco smoke?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  My last question for today.

MR. BRENNER:  Calls for a medical opinion.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I disagree.

THE COURT:  Can you all approach?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Everybody is here?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the Court, my argument here is I'm specifically staying away from the causation of disease.  I've already established this man knows about the poisons in smoke.  Now I'm trying to establish the chronic exposure to those poisons without then going to the next stage, which is the diagnosis of disease.

THE COURT:  Your question is but for his addiction to the nicotine in cigarettes, would

Page 5699 he have been chronically exposed to the

disease-causing chemicals in the tobacco smoke?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Correct.

MR. BRENNER:  Diseased caused by I think he can ask him if the addiction caused --

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, they said he can't opine that the chemicals caused the disease.

MR. BRENNER:  Exactly.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  But he can opine that the disease-causing chemicals or the exposure.  I can take out the word "disease" and say "poisonous chemicals," Judge.  But it doesn't run afoul of the fact that he's not a medical doctor.  It's my last question, and I think it's appropriate.

THE COURT:  What if he makes that change to it, the poison whatever it is.  What's your rephrased question?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I would take out the word "disease" and put in poisons.

MR. GDANSKI:  Carcinogens.

MR. FURR:  It would cure the objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  So you can ask it as rephrased.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    May it please the Court.  Let me rephrase

this question.

But for the addiction to the nicotine,

would he have been chronically exposed to the

poisonous chemicals in cigarette smoke for the

duration of the years that he was exposed to it?

A    No.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  See you tomorrow morning.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're

have a 9:30, don't I?

THE BAILIFF:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Be back at, I guess, 9:45

tomorrow morning.  Don't discuss this with

anyone, with family members or anybody else, or

among yourselves during the break until

tomorrow, until you report back to Court.

THE BAILIFF:  Don't forget the notebooks. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  I have the 9:30, but like I said, this morning I had a 9:30 and it was done by 9:40.  So that may happen. Sometimes they show up and they've agreed. Sometimes I can do it in 15 minutes.  Sometimes it takes a whole half hour.  I would say get here no later than 9:45.  So that if we're done early, we can start early because tomorrow I do have to take a longer lunch break.

MR. GDANSKI:  Just for planning purposes, what time is lunch?

THE COURT:  Probably close to noon, a few minutes before noon until about 2:00.

DIRECT EXAMINATION, CONTINUING, BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q.  Let's take up where we left off.  I'm loath to make promises that I only have a few more minutes to go.  That's my intent.

But I have a tendency to go overly long. Let's see if we can wrap this up in the next little bit and turn you over to cross.

Okay, Doc? A.  Okay. Q.  Thanks.

Let's go to the withdrawal board that is the � from the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is the first one. I want the next one, please.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  So yesterday we were talking about this Diagnostic and Statistics Manual.  We're going to talk about Mr. Shulman's withdrawal.

As an overview, did he meet, in your assessment, the criteria for withdrawal from � from cigarettes and nicotine that corresponds to the severity of dependence that you've described that he suffers from?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=217
Page 5711 A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And in that regard, have you

used this withdrawal criteria even in your own

practice as a useful tool?

A. Yeah. Those are the � those are the validated withdrawal symptoms, and he met them all.

Q.  And to clear up any confusion I may have created yesterday.  Overall, the other part of the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual, the substance abuse disorder subsection for nicotine, has that been scientifically validated?

A.  Well, it's not used by nicotine cessation researchers because they find it overly vague and it doesn't predict cessation.

So mostly, it's not � the criteria are not what's called anchored so that different people � it's overly complicated.

Different people have trouble interpreting it.  So that's part of why they don't use it, and they don't use it because it doesn't predict cessation.

So in the past, it's only the craving to which is considered an important withdrawal symptom, but you can see here that craving is not

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=218
Page 5712 included as a withdrawal symptom.

It's a separate � it's a separate

category, so it's confusing and it doesn't tell

you when you do � when you score this, it doesn't

tell you how much withdrawal or how little

withdrawal.  It just tells you how many symptoms

that you have.

So that's part of the problem.

Q.  All right.  So with regard to some of these terms, "craving," generally, what does that mean, "craving"?

A.  A strong, kind of overbearing, desire to use -- to use the drug.

Q.  And what does it do in terms of what the patient who has suffered from craving thinks about, depending on its severity?

A.  Well, they might be preoccupied with it. It creates a kind of insecurity in the person, a pressure on them to use.

A nicotine hunger is really what it is. That's what they call it � what I call it. It's a hunger for the product, for the nicotine.

Q.  And was that a term that you actually saw reported in this case involving Mr. Shulman, the word "hunger"?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=219
Page 5713 A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And you feel that's the kind � can you tell the jurors, is that, to you, as a clinician and researcher, the kind of thing that's predictive, indicative, important evidence when assessing the severity of dependence to nicotine?

A.  Well, he had a full � a full nicotine withdrawal syndrome, and it was kind of extreme, from my experience.

You know, his brain hurt.  His body hurt.  His arms and legs felt like rubber bands. He �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor. That's not responsive to the question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It went a little further, but I'll break it down.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain the objection.

Q.   (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  All right.  So �

MR. FURR:  Move to strike, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll strike the � I'll strike the last answer.

Please proceed. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  Just the part about the hunger, he reported that, and is

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=220
Page 5714 that a predictive item that he reported to you, the concept of the nicotine hunger?

A.  Yes.  He was out on a boat once and he � for four or five hours, and he reported a extreme hunger, nicotine hunger, need for the drug, intense craving.

So that's a kind of classic symptom of people who are severely addicted.

Q.  Now let's say � let's look at this �

THE COURT:  Let me clarify something with the jury.

When I said that I � that I � not this answer but the answer before, when I struck it, that means the jury should disregard it.  I didn't say that in my instruction.

Go ahead.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you, Judge. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  So as we go through here, we see these different elements of what constitutes the diagnostic criteria to meet withdrawal.

And I want to look at B, where it talks about these different kinds of things, and then I have a board here, the next one I'd like to put up, and ask you whether or not all of these

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=221
Page 5715 were � based on your assessment of the record, were all of these withdrawal symptoms reported in your evaluation of this case for Mr. Shulman, please?

So can you tell us about this, bring us through that?  First, can you verify that things like anger, irritability, frustration are symptoms that Mr. Shulman suffered from in his withdrawal?

A.  Yeah.  Every one of these symptoms was included in the record that I reviewed.

Q.  How about anxiety and nervousness?

A.  Anxiety, nervousness, anger, irritability, frustration, concentration problems, confusion, increased appetite, restlessness, edgy, climbing the wall without a cigarette, pushed to the limit, nailed to the wall, left job, movie theatres to smoke, would miss the story of the show, mentally punished himself if he could not do it.

So all these were symptoms that, together, when you look at the totality of it, is what it feels like, what the nicotine withdrawal syndrome feels like in severe addiction from tobacco.

Q.  Are these � can you correlate this as

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=222
Page 5716 reported by Mr. Shulman to what you encounter in

your practice with the thousand or so sick smokers

you've taken care of, please?

A.  Well, I'd say this is an extreme version of withdrawal that he had.

Q.  And you had said this is all along a continuum, in other words, you talk about severity, mild to severe? A.  Right.

Q.  You used the term comparing apples to oranges?

A.  Right.

Q.  Are there profoundly different experiences amongst nicotine-dependent persons, depending on their � the biological severity of their nicotine?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative. MR. SCHLESINGER:  I don't think I asked this, Judge.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You may answer. Should I have it read back? THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I'm sorry. MR. SCHLESINGER:  Read it back, please. I have to give the court reporters a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=223
Page 5717 chance to --

(A portion of the record was read by

Court Reporter Moreno as follows:

"Q.  Are there profoundly different

experiences amongst

nicotine-dependent persons,

depending on their � the

biological severity of their

nicotine?")

THE WITNESS:  Yes, because a lot of

people are surprised that they don't have really

withdrawal.  So it's much easier for them to quit,

and, you know, that's true for a lot of people.

But when you get into the higher levels,

when you get � you know, when you leave the

apples and go into the oranges, it's a very

different group of people, and what they go

through is very different.

And he's in � you know, this is an

extreme version of withdrawal.

Q.   (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  All right.  Now

there's another � another section in the

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual's criteria for

withdrawal.

And I want to address the symptoms

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=224
Page 571 attributable to Mr. Shulman that correspond to those features, please.

So did you determine from the record that Mr. Shulman suffered from each and every one of these specific examples that go along with withdrawal symptoms?

A.  Right.  He had � he had depression, disappointment, upset.  A lot of the symptoms that look like a clinical depression he had.

Now that doesn't quite describe it.  It is like a clinical depression.  It overlaps with it, but it has its own dynamic, nicotine withdrawal.

Missing something, that's a profound part of extreme withdrawal.  Losing something, when those cells are empty.

"Brain and body hurt."  "Disturbed me very much."  "Never fit into my own skin," is something I hear a lot.

The emotional adjustment is something that I've focused on a lot.  That's the higher hurdle for extreme addicts.  They don't feel right.  They don't feel comfortable in their own skin.

Feeling like elastic bands on his arms

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=225
Page 5719 and legs and he couldn't loosen them, that's a

very � that's an unusual, extreme symptom.

"Fighting it, and I completely lost the fight," low morale, dependent, completely lost, didn't know where he was going, not happy, couldn't stand it, powerful nagging feeling, again, something missing, feeling sick, very sick, and increased mental stress over time.

So the stress of it just got to the point where he couldn't stand it and he'd go back.

Q.  All signs and symptoms in Mr. Shulman demonstrated that were attributable to the withdrawal symptoms from his powerful dependence on nicotine?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Did he suffer from all of these, Mr. Shulman, specifically �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  That was the last question, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Are these general or specific to the Plaintiff Shulman in this case? A.  These are his symptoms, what happened to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=226
Page 5720 him when he tried to get out of smoking for the

trap that it set for him.

Q.  Now the � one of the things about "never fit into my own skin," you say is a common thing that you hear.

What is this � what is:  My skin is crawling?  What is that symptom or symptomatology or terminology?  Are you familiar with that, that "the skin is crawling" or � what is that?

A.  I'm not sure what you're referring to.

Q.  All right.  Then I won't mess with it.

The � so do withdrawal symptoms � and you said they have to be the kind of things that occur within the first 24 hours?

A.  Well, that's how it defined, yeah, by DSM, within 24 hours.

Q.  When you come to offer the hopefulness to patients that � to try to change their cognitive mind-set to give them a chance to quit, what is the significance to you of actually being able to make it 24 hours?

If a patient can make it � unlike Mr. Shulman, if a patient can make it 24 hours, what � what do you hope to see from something like that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=227
Page 5721 A.  Well, that is � that is considered a

very good prognostic sign.  If you can get 24

hours, you have a much better chance of actually

making it.

So people who can't get 24 hours are considered much more severely addicted and are going to have a much harder time.

Q.  Now the � we were talking about the DSM and the lack of validity.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I get the Elmo?

I want to show this from the DSM.

MR. FURR: As long as I can show the portions of it, if you'll stipulate to that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I had a feeling you were going to do that.

MR. FURR:  Is there an agreement?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure, yeah.

MR. FURR:  We have an agreement that during my direct examination of other witnesses and his cross that I can show the portions of DSM?

MR. SCHLESINGER: Well, no, cross, I thought you said.

MR. FURR:  No, for my witnesses also.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Sure.  Why not.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=228
Page 5722 MR. FURR:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  What's the � what's the � what is the stipulation?

MR. FURR:  We have an agreement.  I will not object to the use of this document now, and counsel has agreed that during my direct examination of my addiction expert and during cross-examination of this witness, I can show other portions of the DSM.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  You bet.

THE COURT:  That is agreed to by the parties, and the Court so orders.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  So there's a � remember we talked yesterday about the warning on the DSM and �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think there's a way to zoom this.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let me help you.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I can figure it out.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll give you ten seconds to figure it out and I'll just help you.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Ah, they moved it.  It used to be down there.  Thanks.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  So under

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=229
Page 5723 this � under this Cautionary Statement � the Elmo is like the old slide � the old overhead projector, the transparency projector when we were kids, only now they've got a camera in it.  Okay?

Have you seen this?  Have you used these before?

A.  No.

Q.  All right.  So Elmo, I guess, is the name of it.  It says "Elmo".

So here, Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM, and then just right here in terms of the warning that comes with this thing, do you see here where it says that:  Use of the DSM-5 should be informed by an awareness of the risks and limitations of its use in forensic settings.

When the DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descriptions are employed for forensic purposes, there is a risk that diagnostic information will be misused or misunderstood.

And these dangers arise because of the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern of the law and the information contained in the clinical diagnosis.

Are you familiar with that Cautionary

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=230
Page 5724 Statement in this book?

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  Was that what you were trying to explain yesterday?

A.  Yes, and the idea that you're not really supposed to use this book unless you have experience, knowledge, and specialized training in treating nicotine addiction, because it's dangerous to talk about things you don't understand and I'm not going to do that when I'm here.  I'm not going to talk about things I don't understand.

Q.  Is it sort of like a dentist trying to perform neurosurgery?

A.  Well, something like that maybe.

Q.  Okay.  The idea being that you practice in a � do you practice in a multidisciplinary effort when you take care of patients who have nicotine-dependent disease processes?

A.  Yeah, I mean, typically, a lot of times what will happen is a cancer doctor or a heart doctor or a COPD doctor, lung doctor, will send me their patients because they can't make progress with them as long as they're smoking.

So they don't try to treat the smoking.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=231
Page 5725 They're treating the COPD; they're treating the

cancer; they're treating the heart disease.

And they send them to me to treat the

smoking, because it's � if you're smoking and you

have cancer, you have twice the risk of getting

another tumor.

So their job � they can't do their job

unless they get somebody to help them stop

smoking.

Q.  So � and let me just get this straight. In the role you play, you work with physicians with patients who have nicotine dependence?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you need � if you need to use medicine as a Ph.D., do you have prescribing authority �

A.  No.

Q.  � for medicine?

A.  No.

Q.  So how do you get � patients who you think need prescription medicine for nicotine dependence, how do you see to it that they get the medicine they need?

A.  So I work with their doctors.  I work with the specialists who are treating them, or

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=232
Page 5726 their primary care doctors, and they do the

medicine, that's what they do, and I do their

smoking cessation.

Q.  Okay.  And in that regard, do you use medicines?

A.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  We'll use every � we'll try anything that we think is going to help that person, and we � we'll turn everything upside-down to try to do the best we can.

Q.  Are you a proponent of nicotine replacement therapies?

A.  Yes, I'm a strong believer in that.

Q.  Do you use nicotine replacement therapy mono-therapy or multiple?

A.  Well, multiple.  It's not often used, and for these severe cases that's really what they need.

And most primary care people or specialists don't know about that and don't � don't use it aggressively enough, and that's what you really need to do.

Q.  What's �

A.  It works well, if you use it properly.

Q.  Okay.  So what do you like to see used when you use combo nicotine replacement therapy,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=233
Page 5727 what do you feel increases the chances of helping the patients?

A.  Well, it's called nicotine replacement. So I try to set it up so they're actually replacing the nicotine.

If they're a two-pack-a-day smoker, that's a lot.  They need to use the patch and a gum or the patch and an inhaler, or, you know, they need to really get the nicotine that they're � that they're craving, and you can do that.

You can do that through what's called combination nicotine replacement therapy.

Q.  Do your patients � do any of your patients become lifelong nicotine replacement therapy users?

A.  Yes.  I mean, I've had people who quit for 20 years, they tried to stop the gum, they went back on the cigarettes.  Their brain is permanently changed.  They just need that nicotine.

Q.  With regard to the drugs, what are the � what are the two main prescription oral medications that are out nowadays for smokers?

A.  Right.  There's something called Zyban,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=234
Page 572 which is also called Wellbutrin, which is an

antidepressant, but it's also helped smokers, and

it's a terrific drug.  It's a great drug.

And there's something called Chantix,

which also can be helpful for some people, but

there have been a lot of problems associated with

it.

Q.  And so as between the two, which do you prefer?

A.  I like Wellbutrin.

Q.  And you said Wellbutrin is a form of an antidepressant.

During a great many of the smoking years that Mr. Shulman was dependent to the cigarettes, the nicotine in them, was Wellbutrin even available?

A.  I don't believe so.  I don't remember exactly the year it came out, but...

Q.  If you had a time machine and you could go back � you described yesterday many symptoms which also overlap the concepts of symptoms of depression.

Do you feel that Mr. Shulman, were it available to him many years ago, Wellbutrin could have been �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=235
Page 5729 MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for

speculation.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  � a benefit?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Would Mr. Shulman have been a patient that you would have suggested Wellbutrin to combat the depressive symptoms you saw in his withdrawal?

A.  Well, because there's such a powerful overlap between the symptoms in the DSM of clinical depression and his symptoms, it would � it would be a natural fit, although even if you're not depressed, it does treat nicotine withdrawal even in nondepressed patients.

So it's a very good drug.  It's one of the major advances we've had in treating smokers.

Q.  Even with all these methodologies, are the quit rates for smokers, to this day, still well under 50 percent in any given year for a smoker?

A.  I'm sorry to say that that's true.  I mean, the quit rate is � is very low.  It's like three percent.

I mean, if you � if you look at � there are now 45 million smokers and about three

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=236
Page 5730 percent, maybe a million or a million and a half

quit every year.  So it sounds like a lot.

If you go out 50 years, you'll get 60

million quits, but basically only three percent �

75 percent want to quit every year, and only three

percent actually do it.

That's � that's a pretty sad record.  I

mean, this is a hard � this is a hard drug for a

lot of people to quit.

Q.  You said yesterday that over 90 percent of folks that smoke wish they never smoked?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the concept of the regretful smoker, is that a concept you're familiar with?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Was Mr. Shulman one of those kinds of smokers, in your determination of his record, yes or no?

A.  Yes.

Q.  A regretful smoker?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now you had said something about the disconnect, you know, the � that there's a disconnect between his intent and what he wanted, and I never got you to explain what you meant

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=237
Page 5731 there, please.

A.  I mean, I think this is a lot of what my job is, is to deal with the disconnect. Clinically, I've seen this for years, and now the neuroscience is catching up and explaining part of what's behind the disconnect, but they intend to do it.

Mr. Shulman puts it very well.  He intended not to smoke in bed, but he smoked in bed.  He intended to please his wife, but he smoked.

So this is what I see when people come to me.  They intend to quit smoking, but for some reason, there's a disconnect, and they don't do it.

And my job is to basically make them whole and get rid of that disconnect, however I can do it.

Q.  And there's another � I don't know if you used that term or not.  I think I heard you say � I don't know if I defined it, and I'd feel amiss if I don't.

You talked about maladaptive beliefs that Mr. Shulman suffered from. Tell us about that, please.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=238
Page 5732 A.  This is one of the basic concepts in

cognitive behavioral therapy that we help people

with, that the beliefs drive � that what people

believe drives their behavior.

And maladapt- � one of the maladaptive beliefs that comes out of the false belief syndrome that was created by the tobacco industry is that you need to smoke �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor. That's not responsive.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, it actually is, Judge.  That's exactly what I'm asking about.  If he could finish.

MR. FURR:  I object.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You may finish, please.

A.  Okay.  The social environment is a big part of addiction.  It promotes addiction, and that's why there's many more cigarette smokers who are addicts than other kinds of substance abuse.

But the big false belief syndrome that was created was that somehow the cigarette was a way to cope with modern life.

We all have complicated lives.  We all

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=239
Page 5733 have many demands on us.  The cigarette was

presented to the average person as:  Hey, this

is � this is a way to make that better, or catch

the trains, in some of the commercials, or

whatever it is.  This is a fun thing.  This is a

thing that you can affiliate with other people and

deal with stress.

And that turned out to be a big lie.  In terms of � in terms of research, we know, the science is clear that smoking does not � does not reduce stress.  It reduces the stress of being addicted to smoking.  That's the stress it reduces.

Q.  Now you started talking about the biopsychosocial model.  Tell us what that is, please.

A.  So in terms of behavior, we believe in addiction that there's a biological process, a chemical addiction.  If there was no nicotine in the cigarette, nobody would smoke it.  It has a biological basis.

You take ten puffs or eight puffs on each cigarette, and that's reinforcing, that's fueling that car that's out of control.

So it's got the biology.  It's got the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=240
Page 5734 repetition, the overlearned behavior.  Like when

you walk, you don't think about it.  That's what a

smoker is like.  They're not even thinking about

it.  It's just automaticity, automatic behavior.

And then there's the social environment that you're in, and that promotes smoking, or, you know, it � whatever you believe about it, cultural beliefs, deeply ingrained cultural beliefs that this is normal behavior, that something is normal about smoking cancerous chemicals, that that's normal.  That was created.

Q.  Now you have a chapter in your book, "The Role of the Tobacco Industry in Creating a False Belief Syndrome."  That's part of your book, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So tell the jurors, if you would, what role did the tobacco companies play in Mr. Shulman's addiction, please?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection. Cumulative to Dr. Proctor's testimony.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No.  This is specific to Mr. Shulman.  Dr. Proctor didn't talk about Mr. Shulman at all.  I'm almost certain of that.

question is:
	Can you tell the jurors, based on

your analysis

Page 5736 THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You may finish,

please.

A.  Mr. Shulman believed that he was doing something that was for fun, not for disease.  He thought he was doing something for fun, not addiction.

He didn't think this was going to cause huge lifelong problems for him.  He thought he was buying fun, and he bought addiction.

Q.  The words that your � your � your patients use to describe why they smoke other than addiction, pleasure, fun, taste, satisfaction, relaxation, enjoyment, what have you written about where those words come from that you're hearing your patients use, please?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for hearsay, by definition.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  What is your scientific conclusion as to why addicted smokers use those words that I described, fun, satisfaction, taste, pleasure?  Why do they use those words?

A.  Well, I think what happens to a lot of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=243
Page 5737 smokers is that when they start off, it feels good

because they're doing it with people, and it's

manipulating their dopamine system.

And also when you're a teenager � and this is interesting � there's more reward and there's less withdrawal.

So when you buy into it as a teenager, you're getting the good stuff and you're not getting the bad stuff.

But later it's a different story, and so they believe � I'm sorry.  I've lost the question.

Q.  I apologize.  I was talking about the role tobacco played in the social environment. You said it created the culture of the social environment.

I want to know the words that the smokers you hear use to describe their smoking, fun, taste, pleasure, satisfaction, enjoyment, relaxation.  Where do those words come from?

A.  Well, they thought they were going to get those things, but I think what happens in the end is that the thing that makes them feel good about smoking � most of the smokers I see � is that they're escaping the addiction every time

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=244
Page 573: they take a cigarette, because if they don't smoke

they're feeling bad.

So instead of smoking to feel good, they're smoking to avoid the bad feelings that the cigarettes give them.  And that's a very confusing thing to a lot of people.

Q.  All right.  Now the next thing I want to show you is a board that talked about Mr. Shulman's � the different ways in which he tried to quit, and we're going to bring this up.

Let me ask you this:  Based on your assessment of Mr. Shulman, the man he is and the historical context in which �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me.  This wasn't shared with us.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, it was.  It was yesterday.

THE COURT:  Do you want to show them this in advance, please?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I gave this to you yesterday.

MR. FURR:  You showed me yesterday?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yeah, we gave that to you yesterday, absolutely.

MR. FURR:  Well, then, it's

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=245
Page 5739 cumulative.

MR. GDANSKI:  We showed it to you, but we didn't use it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  We didn't use it.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.

All right.  So let's put that up. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  And let me ask as a prefatory question �

THE COURT:  This is just a demonstrative?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  � as a prefatory question:  Is the � do � is the science � what does the science say to you about whether quitting is a failure of will for addicted smokers?

Is it a failure of will?  Is it a moral weakness, a weakness of will?  What have you learned about that and what do you teach about that, please?

A. I think in the '40s and the '50s, people believed that, that it was just something you had to be strong about, and either you were strong or weak, and either you could do it or you couldn't.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=246
Page 5740 Now we know that there's changes in the

brain, that addiction isn't some kind of excuse

for weakness, that addiction is something that

is � that is a drug you take that changes your

brain.

And there's a science that's explaining why this is difficult to do. It's not just about being weak or strong, and it's not an excuse.

Q.  So let's look at the � within his era and over the life course of his smoking, within his era, did he demonstrate to you whether or not he tried as best he knew how, for the kind of man he was, based on your analysis?

A.  Well, I felt he � this is a guy who was very strong, very disciplined, and used to being successful.

And I think one of the striking things is that he was successful in many other areas of his life, but he wasn't successful with this.

And I think what happens to people is that when they fail, it's harder the next time they try.

And it's clear, the science is clear about this, that it's not � motivation is not the ultimate determinant of � it's the ultimate

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=247
Page 5741 determinant if you try.

But it's not the ultimate determinant if

you succeed.  The ultimate determinant of

succeeding is how addicted you are.  And the

science is clear on that.

Q.  You've written extensively on this?

A.  Well, I've written about it, yeah.

Q.  And you teach on this?

A.  I do.

Q.  Now for Mr. Shulman specifically, did you see that he used these following methods, cutting down, trying to lessen smoking.

Is cutting down a common way to try to quit?

A.  It is a common way, and it's one of the ineffective techniques that people use because it's frustrating to them, because when you're addicted it means that you've lost control.

And cutting down is trying to control something you can't control, and it frustrates them and it breaks their confidence, and that's what happens to a lot of smokers.

I believe that smokers suffer from broken confidence as well as chemical dependency.

A.  He did.

Q.  Dumpsters, trash �

A.  He threw away his cigarettes in dumpsters �

Q.  � toilets?

A.  � and toilets, yeah, all that.

Q.  Did he � did he try to � did he throw away cigarette paraphernalia?

A.  I believe he did.

Q.  Did he � did he use chewing gum?

A.  He did.

Q.  Did he use a wooden cigarette, a fake cigarette?

A.  I think that's in there.

Q.  Did he use some like hard candies to suck on?

A.  I don't remember that, but, you know, it's probably in there.  So many things that he tried.  He tried all the self-help things � MR. FURR:  Your Honor � THE WITNESS:  � that he could think of.

MR. FURR:  � it's not responsive.  The question was:  Did he use hard candy?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=249
Page 5743 MR. SCHLESINGER:  He doesn't � he said

he doesn't � we'll move on.

THE COURT:  I will � I will sustain the

objection and strike the last answer.  The jury

should disregard it.

Ask your next question.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Did he use a pipe?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did he use a cigar �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � to try as a way to wean himself or change over?

A.  Yes.  All these are the typical things that people try to do.

Q.  Did he use nicotine gum?

A.  He did.  He describes the packaging of the nicotine gum, and this is a strange part of the case because he � he obviously knew about the nicotine gum, because he described the little � the little tablets in the package exactly the way they are.

So there's no way he could have known that if he had never used nicotine gum, and he says he used nicotine gum around a dozen times over a six-month period.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=250
Page 5744 The strange thing about it is the

nicotine gum didn't even come on the market until

1984.  So that's a puzzle.

Q.  Does � because of what you said about theatres banning smoking, the period of time that he met with and got some inspiration from Yvonne, as well as this characteristic description of the nicotine gum �

A.  Right.

Q.  � are � can you � are these pieces of evidence that date his smoking cessation to this mid '80s period in conflict with what we see in the '70s?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  What does it tell you about when he may have quit smoking?

A.  It suggests that he quit later than '75, but, you know, strange things happen.  And if somebody quits or they � they remember quitting, but then they're smoking again.

So the most likely outcome of any attempt to � to quit is relapse.  That's just a fact of my field.  That's the most likely � and the relapse rates are similar to heroin and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=251
Page 5745 cocaine and alcohol.

Q.  What is the best cessation method ever

when it comes to nicotine addiction?

A.  Never to start.

Q. You know, have you � have you appeared before a national audience to try to teach folks how to get off cigarettes, a national television audience?

A.  I did.  I did do the Oprah show.

Q.  Tell us about that.

A.  Well, it was an interesting experience for me.  We tried very hard.  It was the whole show.  It was the whole hour.  We had 300 smokers in the audience, and we spent a month or a month and a half preparing.

We tried to do the best job we can, because that show reaches millions of people, and if we said anything wrong, we could � we could misinform people.  So we tried very hard to get every detail right.

We worked as hard as we could, and it was good.  It was a good show.  It was an important show.

I think we got out to a lot of people the message that people may think they're smoking

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=252
Page 5746 for stress, but it's not going to � it doesn't

help with stress.

Because if you have real problems in

life, smoking is not an answer for your real

problems in life.  It doesn't change what's going

on in your life in a good way.

Q.  Were you offering � who was in the audience?  What was the audience made up of?

A.  There were 300 smokers in the audience.

Q.  Were you � were you trying to help them?

A.  Well, we were trying to do everything that we could.  We had a smaller group that were presenting specific kinds of issues to us, and � and I think it came off as a positive public education.

I'm trying to do public education because I have learned a lot over the years.  I've been running a blog out of The Huffington Post. I'm trying to do different things to get out the word about how dangerous the product is.

Q.  Last area, you had talked about the fact that when you work with physicians at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center that the � and I

Page 5747 guess some of these are faculty physicians?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Oncology?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Pulmonology?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Doctors who are doing lung cancer?

A.  Exactly.

Q.  Thoracic surgeons removing lungs?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Doctors treating for COPD, doing lung transplants for � for emphysema?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And are � these are the kinds of doctors who are sending patients to you to help them break their nicotine dependence, even though they're smoking in the face of this disease?

A.  Yeah, because doctors don't do this, really.  They might do it a little bit, but they're very, very busy people.

They have many, many things that they need to do, and so they're happy to have somebody else � to work collaboratively with somebody, because they can't make progress.

Q.   (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Is smoke �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I can move on.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Is smoking, despite the harmful consequences or disease, an important feature that defines addiction?

If someone knows it's bad for you or is lose � getting short of breath or getting sick from it, is smoking � despite that, is that one of the hallmark indicators of addiction?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Cumulative.

THE COURT:  Sustained, and strike the last answer, because I've sustained the objection. The jury should disregard it.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Do you have an opinion, based upon a reasonable medical probability, as to whether or not smoking, despite knowledge or experience of harm, is a feature of addiction?

define this earlier yesterday in one of the

definitions

A.  I think that we have defined what "addiction" is.

Q.  Okay.  I'm not going � I'm not going to belabor it, but what I want to know from you is: In Mr. Shulman's case, did you come to a conclusion as to whether or not, in fact, the smoking diseases he suffered from, the bladder cancer, the heart disease, and the emphys- � the COPD, were substantially caused by his smoking addiction?

MR. FURR: Objection. Leading. Not a proper subject for this witness, Your Honor. We went over this yesterday.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I think I've established the predicate.  I can try again, Judge, briefly.

Q.   (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  My questions prefatory to this are:  Do you work with the physicians that treat the patients who suffer from the smoking-related diseases?  They send them to you?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=256
Page 5750 A.  Yes, they do.

Q.  So does the reason they're sending them

to you have something to do with the fact that the

diseases they got are from the addiction that they

want you to treat?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

MR. BRENNER:  Calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You explain it. Explain why doctors who treat tobacco-related diseases are sending their patients to you to treat for nicotine dependence, please.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This is cumulative.  We talked about this ten minutes ago. He gave a lengthy explanation as to why people � how busy they are, why they send him their patients.

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  I'm going to go with the three sustained in a row means you're done.  I'm going to say:  No further questions.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. FURR:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Seidman. A.  Good morning.

Q.  We met yesterday when the jury was out of the room.  My name is Jeff Furr.  I represent RJ Reynolds.

I am going to follow up on the same types of topics and questions that Mr. Schlesinger has been asking you.

Okay.  You've been � you've been very forthcoming with us so I won't belabor this, but, obviously, you're not a medical doctor, right? A.  I'm a clinical psychologist.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=258
Page 5752 Q.  So you're not a medical doctor?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And as you just told us, you can't prescribe medicines to treat patients for nicotine addiction?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  You don't diagnose and treat people for bladder cancer?

A.  No.

Q.  You don't diagnose and treat patients for COPD?

A.  No.

Q.  You don't diagnose and treat patients for cardiovascular disease, correct?

A.  Well, the only thing I would like to say about that is by treating the smoking, you actually are treating those illnesses.  You're treating heart disease, you're treating bladder cancer, you're treating COPD, because those conditions can't get better as long as you're smoking.

So in that sense, I do treat those things.

Q.  You treat the smoking component?

A.  I treat the smoking component,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=259
Page 5753 exactly.

Q.  You don't treat the underlying disease?

A. Well, it is treating the underlying disease, because those diseases get worse if you're smoking.

Q.  Okay.  Well, let me ask you this � let me talk about something else.

Throughout yesterday and today, on multiple occasions, you testified as to what Mr. Shulman thought or believed or what he intended.

Do you recall doing that?

A.  I testified about what he said in his deposition.

Q.  Exactly, because you're not a mind reader, are you?

A.  Well �

Q.  Are you a mind reader, yes or no?

A.  Of course I'm not a mind reader, but � can I finish?

Q.  No.  That's a yes or no question. You're not a mind reader?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Judge. Just for protocol, if he asks to finish, could he please be allowed to finish, because Your Honor

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=260
Page 5754 can only strike it if what he did was

nonresponsive.

Blocking it may �

MR. FURR:  I think it was �

THE COURT:  No, generally, I let you handle that on redirect.

So let's just proceed.  Ask your next question.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Now you � as you just said, what you did during your testimony was simply repeat things that you read in the record, correct?

A.  No, that's not correct.

Q.  Well, when you were talking about what Mr. Shulman believed or intended or thought, what you were doing was repeating parts, but not all, of what you saw in the record, right?

A.  What I was doing is interpreting it based on my experience, expertise, and knowledge, which is why I'm here.

That's the whole purpose of me being here, is to read the record with my experience, knowledge, and training and give an opinion. That's why I'm here.

I'm not just taking something at face

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=261
Page 5755 value.  I'm bringing 25 years of experience in

this field to it.  So it's � no, it's not face value of what � what he said.

Q.  When you said � when you told the jury what Mr. Shulman thought, you were telling the jury what you had read in the record, correct?

A.  Well, I was � I was taking what he read [sic] in the record, and I was looking at in terms of my experience and saying:  Wow, that's � that rings true.  That's the same kind of thing that my patients say.

That's � when he says things like, you know:  I can't live without a cigarette, that's the stuff I hear all the time.

So I'm taking it and I'm using my experience to understand it, which is my understanding of why I'm here.

Q.  I understand that � you also told the jury what you believe statements meant that he made, right?

You're telling us if he said something, you could share with the jury your experience and what you believe that meant, but that's not my question.

My question is:  When you told the jury

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=262
Page 5756 what Mr. Shulman thought, you were repeating part, but not all, of what you read in the record, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  Asked and answered, Judge.  That's the third or fourth time.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I read thousands of pages about this case, and I thought a lot about Mr. Shulman, and I'm giving my opinions based on my training, experience, and knowledge in response to what I read.

I'm not taking it at face value.  I'm looking at what he said, and I'm saying:  Wow, this rings true with what I've seen in severe addiction.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Similarly, when you told this jury what Mr. Shulman believed, what you were doing is repeating part, but not all, of what you read in the record on specific issues, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Same objection, Your Honor.  Again, it's � I know I've heard this question a third time now.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, you're assuming that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=263
Page 5757 I agree with you, and I don't agree with what

you're saying.  I'm not just taking it at face

value.

I'm listening to it carefully, and I'm

saying:  These are the things I've heard from

untold numbers of patients in the same kinds of

things.

Why � if somebody says that, they

obviously have a condition, because how would they

know those things unless they had that condition?

So it rings true to me, and that's my

opinion.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Similarly, when you told Mr. � this jury what Mr. Shulman intended to do, what you were doing was repeating part, but not all, of what you read in the record, correct?

A.  No, I � no, that is not � that's not correct.

Q.  Wouldn't you agree with me that on multiple occasions over the past day and a half, when you were addressing specific issues related to Mr. Shulman, you provided opinions that were based upon some, but not all, of the facts in the record?

A.  I read everything carefully, and I

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=264
Page 575: thought about everything very carefully, and I

considered everything in the record.

I didn't just consider part of the record.  I considered all of the record.  And my opinion, I think, is based on the totality of the record.

If I missed something, I apologize, but I looked � I read carefully.  I thought very hard about it, and I wasn't selectively reading it to make a certain kind of case.

I was looking at it and saying:  Wow, these are the things that fit what I know about, because I do this kind of work.

Q.  Well, that's exactly one of the topics that we are going to explore at some length.

We are going to explore whether you selected the facts that fit your theory of the case and presented only those facts on multiple issues to the jury.  We're going to talk about that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge. Move to strike.  That's argumentative and harassing.

MR. FURR:  I'll withdraw it, Your Honor.

And I want to do this in the context at

pgNbr=266
Page 5760 first of the types of patients that you told the jury make up your practice.  Okay?

I listened carefully yesterday, and I wrote down six different ways that you described the patients in your practice.

One is, you called them hard core smokers, right ?

A.  Well, I may have used that term once, but I said there's a variety.  There's a whole, you know, degree.  Some are � some are mild smokers.  Some are moderate.  Some are severe.  I get them all.

Q.  Okay.  I'll rephrase it.

Your patient population includes hard core smokers, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And, in fact, you told the jury that you had patients who had already failed in previous quit attempts, right?

A. Yes, that's why they come to me. If they could quit on their own, they would have quit.

Q.  You told the jury that you had � that many of your patients had been referred to you by their doctors, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=267
Page 5761 A.  Yes.

Q.  And you told the jury that many of your

patients already had a disease that they thought

to have been caused by smoking, right?

A.  Some do, and some don't.  Some get it years after I successfully help them quit, unfortunately.

Q.  You told the jury that patients come to you because they are scared to death and desperate to quit smoking, right?

A.  Well, yeah, they're � they're worried about their health.  They tend to come around the age of 40 when they don't feel so immortal.

Q.  Those are the type of patients you get, right?

A.  Some are less addicted.  Some are more addicted.  I get a variety of patients, but all of them are having trouble quitting smoking, or why would they come?  It wouldn't make sense.

Q.  All the ways that we just reviewed that you described your patients to the jury yesterday, those are the types of patients you get, right?

A.  Yes.  Yes, of course.

Q.  Okay.  Now in the context of you treating those types of patients, you never tell

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Seidman, the reason you never tell your patients that they can't quit is because you recognize � that even among the types of patients that you treat that we just talked about, you recognize that the decision �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=270
Page 5764 that the � that it is their decision whether to

smoke or not, correct?

A.  That's partially correct.  They have to make a decision to quit, and then they have to be able to quit, and that's a two-part process.

So I � I believe that it's not for me to judge.  I'm there to help them.  I don't know who is going to quit and who isn't going to quit when they first come to me.  Of course, I'm going to try to help them.

	Q.
	(BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  The question for
	
you,

	, is -
	� when we look at prior transcripts,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=273
Page 5767 the only question that you're being asked is whether I correctly read your prior sworn testimony.

Do you need me to read it again? A.  Can I look at it?

My thought here is that it's their � Q.  Sir, sir � A.  Well, can I answer?

Q.  � the procedure in the courtroom is as follows �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � when I hand you a transcript �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge � Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  � the question that you were asked is whether I have correctly read your prior sworn testimony, and the answer is yes or no.

A.  Well, I think it's misleading �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, may I ask � THE WITNESS:  � because the context � if you don't understand the context � MR. FURR:  Excuse me, sir. Your Honor, will you instruct the witness?

THE COURT:  The witness is instructed to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=274
Page 576: answer the question.  It's a yes or no question.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

That's what it says there, yes.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  Thank you.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now, may I, for rule of completeness, ask that we read the lines �

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  � leading up to it? That's from Line 2 through Line 15, please.

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir. Q.   (BY MR. FURR)  QUESTION:  It's not generally.  I asked you, have you told a patient that they were incapable or unable to stop smoking?

ANSWER:  There are patients I see that it takes them even years to quit smoking, and I don't tell them that it's impossible.

But it's understood they're going to be smoking for a while because they're having a hard time with it, and some of those people can quit ultimately and some of them can't.

It's not really for me to say.  If they want to try to quit, I'll try to work with them.

QUESTION:  All right.  So you've never told a patient then that they couldn't quit

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=275
Page 5769 smoking?

ANSWER:  I think it's their decision.

Sometimes they might decide to smoke or not.  It's

not up to me.

Did I read that question and answers

correctly, sir?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Thank you.

Sir, you told us on direct examination about a couple of books that you have written, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  One is a book titled "Smoke-Free in 30 Days," right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  That is a book that was published just a few years ago, in the year 2010, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  A second book that you published was a book titled, "Helping the Hard-Core Smoker:  A Clinician's Guide," correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And in those books, you expressed many opinions about cigarette smoking and nicotine addiction, in addition to the opinions that you've

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=276
Page 5770 expressed here in this courtroom, correct?

A.  Well, you know, there's � by nature, it's limited.  Yes, there are other opinions. Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Again, I want to start with some basics.  Sir, wouldn't you agree that addicted smokers have the capability of quitting?

A.  Well, of course, they have the cap- � they have the potential and the capability of quitting.

Q. Sir, wouldn't you agree that even highly addicted smokers can and do quit smoking and quit for good?

A.  Some do, and some don't.

Q. But even highly addicted smokers can and do quit smoking and quit for good, correct?

A.  I believe everybody has that potential, and I work with people that way.

MR. FURR:  Could I have the Caprio deposition, please?

May I approach the witness, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Seidman, I'm going to hand you a transcript.  I'11 ask you to look at the front page so we can verify what it is, sir.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=277
Page 5771 (Hands transcript.)

A.  Okay.

Q.  Sir, would you agree that this is a copy � this is a transcript of the deposition that you gave in a case called Edward Caprio on April 18th, 2014? A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  Let me ask you to turn to Page 322, Lines 19 through 23.

Are you there, sir? Are you there? A.  Yes, I am.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Mr. Furr, can I ask this time to read the prefatory questions that lead up to it and so we do the rule of completeness in order, starting at page �

MR. FURR:  No, no, I'm going to read the question that I'm asking about now, and you may request it from the judge.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.  Go ahead. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, isn't it true that you were asked this question and gave this answer: QUESTION:  Let's break them apart.  You agree that highly addicted smokers can and do quit smoking and quit for good?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=278
Page 5772 And your answer was:  Yes.

Did I read that correctly? A.  Yes, you did.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Now can I ask that you read Pages 321 at Line 22 through 322 at Line 17, please?

MR. FURR:  Yes. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  QUESTION:  Okay.  And they were able to quit smoking notwithstanding being addicted?

ANSWER:  I think you're covering the same ground.  Some people are less addicted, and some people are more.

The only thing that predicts an outcome for a quit attempt is the level, whether you're a high-nicotine dependent or low nicotine, not how hard you try, as we've seen over again � over again and again.

So he made all kinds of efforts. He's still making all kinds of efforts, but he hasn't been unable to be successful.

The other thing that predicts success is being low-nicotine dependent versus high-nicotine dependent.  So you're putting both of these groups together.  It doesn't make sense.  It's not

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=279
Page 5773 logical.

QUESTION:  Let's break them apart.  You

agree that highly-addicted smokers can and do quit

smoking and quit for good?

And your answer was:  Yes.

Did I read that correctly?

A.  Well, there was one word off, but it's

close enough, I guess.

Q.  Thank you.

Now by "quit for good," you mean quit

without relapsing, don't you?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  Okay.  Again, some very basic

principles.

Before someone can quit smoking, they

have to make a decision that they want to quit

smoking, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And as we just discussed, it is the

individual smoker that has to make the decision

about whether they want to quit smoking or not,

and no one can make that decision for them, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And when they make that decision that

they want to quit, that's what sets the stage for

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=280
Page 5774 quitting, right?

A.  It sets the stage for quitting.

Q.  Yes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  You agree with that?

A.  So far.

Q.  That's all I've asked so far.

Before a person can successfully quit, that person has to decide that they truly want to quit, correct ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Just saying that a � when a smoker says that they want to quit, that's not sufficient; they have to make a commitment to quitting, correct?

A. Well, the ones who are trying and failing need to try something new. It's a complicated question.  I'm sorry.

Q.  Okay.  I'll ask it slightly different. Do you agree that a commitment to quitting smoking is essential in a smoker successfully quitting?

A.  Well, sometimes you make an effort, and it's counterproductive.  So that's � you know, that's what happened in this case, that the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=281
Page 5775 efforts he made led to a feeling of failure, not a

feeling of success, unfortunately.

So just making an effort, if it's not

the right kind of effort, is not helpful.

Q.  Do you agree that a commitment to quitting smoking is a helpful prerequisite to quitting smoking?

A.  It's a good thing, but if you don't know what you're doing, it's not going to necessarily get you to your goal.

Q.  Okay.  I want to talk further about your observations about this � about the patient population that you treat that we looked at how you described it just a moment ago.

Sir, you agree that most of your own patients walk away smoke-free and stay smoke-free, right?

A.  More than half, but, unfortunately, there are patients that I can't help also.  I don't have an exact number for you, but �

Q.  More than half of them walk away from your program smoke-free and stay smoke-free, right?

A.  I think that's true over the years, maybe 60 percent, but that's not everybody.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=282
Page 5776 Q.  And by walking away smoke-free, you mean they quit smoking, right?

A.  That what I mean.

Q.  And by staying smoke-free, you mean they don't relapse, right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Now, sir, wouldn't you agree that within this patient population that you treat, that you described to us, that most of your own patients are surprised by how easily they quit smoking?

A.  No, I wouldn't agree to that, because I explained that some quit, and they are surprised, they don't even have a withdrawal symptom.  They come once or twice.

Some have to work at it for months or years, that's a lot of work.  And some don't make it, even with everything that we have that we can throw at the problem.  And this guy was trying to do it on his own, and he didn't really know what he was up against.

Q.  Sir, wouldn't you agree that, outside this courtroom, you have stated that:  Most of my patients walk away smoke-free and stay smoke-free. They are surprised at how easily they did it? MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=283
Page 5777 "Outside this courtroom," I object.

MR. FURR:  It's a prior inconsistent statement.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's not confronting a prior inconsistent statement.  It's improper. It's hearsay.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I'm happy to do it that way.  I was trying to adhere to the rule, which is that if he agrees that he makes the statement, I don't have to show him the hearsay, but I'm happy to go straight to it.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure I understand. Do you want to approach?

MR. FURR:  Sure.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  So, Your Honor, I am making an objection based on � I'm making an impeachment based on a prior inconsistent statement.

And the way � the rules are very clear. The way you do that is you confront the witness with whether he made this prior inconsistent statement.

MR. HAMMER:  You know, Judge, this is our objection.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=284
prior

Page 577 MR. FURR:  I'm not done yet.

MR. HAMMER:  This was our objection.

MR. FURR:  If � if he has made the

MR. HAMMER:  It was our objection, and

it's �

MR. FURR:  � inconsistent statement, if he admits that he made it, that's the end of the inquiry.

Impeachment only comes in if the witness denies that he has made that statement elsewhere. If he then does that, then you impeach him with his prior inconsistent statement.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, this is the problem: First of all, with that question, the way it was phrased, "outside of this courtroom" implies: Within this courtroom, you'll say one thing, but outside the courtroom, you'll say another.

They're attacking our litigation. That's � that's something they have filed a motion �

MR. FURR:  Of course I'm attacking his credibility.

MR. HAMMER:  No, no, no, you're attacking our � our presentation of the case.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=285
Page 5779 MR. FURR:  No, I'm saying it's �

MR. HAMMER:  Excuse me, Counsel.

It's saying:  Inside this courtroom, you'll say one thing, but outside, you'll say another.

That is totally improper. It's � it's an improper attack on the witness.

Now if he wants to �

THE COURT:  How is it an improper attack on the witness?  There is such a thing as prior inconsistent statement.  And the question is �

MR. HAMMER:  Absolutely.  I agree with that, Judge.  However, the way that question was phrased � and if you'll look at it, it says:  In this courtroom, you'll � it's basically saying: In this courtroom, you'll say anything, saying: You'll say anything �

THE COURT: Okay. Well, why don't I � I sustain it in the sense of not � not using the term "in this courtroom."

So rephrase it, and avoid using "in this courtroom."

MR. FURR:  Okay.

MR. HAMMER:  And if he does want to impeach, then the proper way to impeach is to take

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=286
Page 5780 the transcript, cite him to a page, and not just

start flailing away, you know, with statements

that he said outside the courtroom supposedly.

MR. FURR:  There's nothing to impeach until he denies it.

THE COURT:  Right.  Okay.

MR. HAMMER:  Yeah, but �

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't understand what's going on.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, isn't it true that you have previously stated that most of � let me start again.

You have previously written that, quote: Most of my patients walk away smoke-free and stay smoke-free.  They are surprised at how easily they did it, or that they could do it at all, exclamation point.

Isn't it true that you've previously written that?

A.  Yes, and the reason I write that is because �

Q.  Excuse me, sir.  The only question is

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=287
Page 5781 whether you've previously �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No.  Judge, he's absolutely allowed to answer that.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, that's a � MR. SCHLESINGER:  No.  Judge, it's perfectly appropriate for him to explain �

THE COURT:  You'll cover that on redirect.

All right.  Proceed to next question. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  The word you used in the quote that we just read was "easily," correct? A.  That's what you just read. Q.  That's what you wrote, right? A.  That's what I wrote. Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

Now you talked about different � certain smoking cessation aids that help people quit, right?

A.  I did.

Q.  And you talked about the types of counseling that you and others can provide to help people quit, right? A.  Correct.

Q.  But it's certainly true that most smokers quit smoking without any form of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=288
Page 5782 counseling, right?

A.  The evidence is that the ones who are more heavily addicted have not made the kind of progress that the general population of smokers has made.

So most people quit on their own. That's how we do it in this country.

Q.  So most people quit smoking without any form of counseling, correct?

A.  Only four percent of people get some kind of treatment or help, counseling for smoking. It's very, very unusual.

Q.  Sir, you would agree that Mr. Shulman quit without obtaining any counseling, correct?

A.  Well, he � he had � he had a relationship with his daughter-in-law, who was one of these natural-type therapist people, who inspired him with hope and challenged his � his beliefs, and I felt that she was an important influence in helping him to quit.

So I felt that she functioned as a therapist even though she was not a trained therapist.  She was one of these natural therapists that you find in life.

Q.  Are you talking about his

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=289
Page 5783 daughter-in-law?

A.  I'm talking about his daughter-in-law.

Q.  And what was her educational background and work background?

A.  I'm just talking about that she's a natural type of therapist.

Q.  No.  My question is:  What was her education?

A.  I don't know anything about that.  I know that she � she knew what she was doing.

Q.  What was her work background?

Q.  What training did she have in providing therapy?

A.  No, she � she didn't.  I'm sure she didn't, but she � there are people who are naturally good at helping other people �

Q.  Okay.  Let me ask the question �

Q.  Let me ask the question this way: Wouldn't you agree that Mr. Shulman quit smoking without obtaining any professional counseling?

A.  Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right, and I had a feeling that if I to go with my client, Mr. Shulman, going � he would not be able to go until 7 p.m.

So I've got a videotape, but it may be that if Mr. Shulman is not up for the testimony this afternoon, we play the videotape and that would be the end of it for us for the evening.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I just wanted to give the Court a heads-up, that's all.

THE COURT:  All right.  And that videotape will take us until about 7 p.m.?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I don't know.  It depends on how long the cross goes.  I don't know how much longer Mr. Furr has for his cross.

THE COURT:  See you at 2:00.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay, Judge.

BY MR. FURR:

CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION

Q    Good afternoon, Dr. Seidman.

A    Good afternoon.

Q    Are you ready to continue?

A    Yes.

Q    I want to begin � move next to � talk about quitting in a little bit more detail.  I want to begin by asking you some questions about how you define a serious quit attempt, okay?

Because there's certain things you look for in a serious quit attempt, right?

A    Well, there are different definitions of it, depending on the situation, whether it's clinical or research.

Q    Well, what you look for and what you define as a serious quit attempt is a quit attempt that involves, first, a self-assessment, right?

A    Well, if somebody is in treatment.  We've already established that only 4 percent of people get any kind of counseling.  So that's only going to be true if someone is getting counseling.  Most people, including Mr. Shulman, never got any counseling.

Q    Okay.

	Q    Sir, please confirm for the jury that you

	Question:  How would you define a serious

	quit attempt ?

Page 5795 self-assessment, preparing to quit, proper use of

medicines, choosing a specific date to quit.  So I

think if all those things are dealt with, then they

are going to have a much more � a higher chance of

success.  They're going to be able to make a more

serious attempt to quit.  I don't think that throwing

your cigarettes in the toilet and hoping for the best

is the proper way to quit.

Did I read that correctly?

A    Yes, you did.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Rule of completeness,

could you continue reading down to line 18 on

the next page, please?

MR. FURR:  Do you think it's a serious

attempt -- question:  Do you think it's a

serious quit attempt?

Answer:  I think those were very desperate

people.  They didn't know what to do.

Question:  Do you agree that a serious quit

attempt is one that involves not smoking for at

least 24 hours?

Answer:  I think that some people in the

research context define it that way because they

need to create an arbitrary standard to do the

research, and that's a standard that they set.

quitting.  If they get only a portion of that

day, they don't consider that a marker for

quitting.

MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, did I read that correctly?

A    Yes.

Q    Back to your definition on the serious quit attempt that we just read.  In addition to self-assessment, you said preparing to quit, right?

A    These are the things that I do with a patient when they see me as a clinical psychologist. This is not what happens out there in the world.

Q    Sir, I'm asking you how you define serious quit attempt when we asked you in your deposition and you said preparing to quit �

A    Right.  I'm talking about what I do as a clinical psychologist.  That's not what 95 percent of the people out there get.

Q    You also said proper use of medications, correct?

A    If they're working with me, but that's not a usual situation.

Q    So am I correct, that's what you said in your deposition?

them,

Q    And you said choosing a specific day to quit, right?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  Choosing quit date.

And you believe that these are the sorts of things that are helpful to a person in being successful in quitting, right?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  I need to approach, Judge, briefly, please.

THE COURT:  Okay. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is � the problem here is time frame.  He hasn't made this in a time frame to Mr. Shulman.  For instance, there was no medicine, there was no behavioral therapy, there was no quit dates, there was no cessation center.  So just like Proctor and those letters --

THE COURT:  He's not asking him about Mr. Shulman.  He's asking him in general what he does .

MR. FURR:  Right.  I'm asking in general.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Then it's not relevant.

to Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  It's relevant to the issues of his expertise and how he handles his expertise and how he does things, I believe.

MR. FURR:  Right.  I'm going to be able to �

THE COURT:  In other words, this is like a doctor or like some sort of an expert, okay, he's a psychologist, and he's asking questions about when you treat patients that -- you know, about quitting, do you normally do this, do you normally do this.  You covered that kind of stuff in your cross.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Not up till today.  They objected on stuff that he was doing today because they said it wasn't relevant to Mr. Shulman and I think it has to be �

MR. FURR:  I think it has to go both ways.

THE COURT:  This goes to his qualifications, how he does things.  He's allowed to test, you know, how this guy does his counseling and his therapy.  Then you're going to ask a bunch of questions about Mr. Shulman and his time.

Page 5799 MR. FURR:  Of course.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  But the predicate for this thing has to be that this is what he's doing today.  He has to define the difference in time frame.

MR. FURR:  That's for the witness to tell me.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No.  If it doesn't � it would be unfair because there was no medication for smoking, cessation, quit dates.  None of that existed in the '60s or '70s.  There was no such thing.  Unless you contextualize what he's talking about is his current qualifications, his current practice unrelated to Shulman, then there is no predicate.

THE COURT:  In my opinion � you can ask him on redirect.  I don't think it's a predicate issue.  You can ask him on redirect.  All that stuff you told Mr. Furr, is that what's done now?  Okay.  Then you can say, was that available back then?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I just need it to be contextualized in a time frame.  My objection is relevance to Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Let's start with something that I think we

can agree upon.

Mr. Shulman no longer smokes, does he?

A    Yes.  He quit smoking, yes.

Q    He quit smoking?

A    Yes, he did.

Q    So he did quit, right?

A    Of course he did.

Q    I knew we'd find common ground here. Mr. Shulman quit smoking without seeing a professional counselor, such as yourself, and making a self-assessment, correct?

A    I don't know how he assessed himself.  I think he assessed himself as a failure, and it took him a lot longer and he got sicker because of it, that it took him so much longer.  If he'd been able to come to me, maybe I could have helped him do it quicker.

Q    Do you remember the question I asked you?

A    No, I don't.

Q    I didn't think so.

Mr. Shulman quit smoking without seeing a professional counselor, such as yourself, and making

Page 5801 a self-assessment pursuant to that counseling, right?

A    I don't know what sort of self-assessment he made.  He's not my -- he may have made some assessment of himself.

Q    Mr. Shulman successfully quit smoking without going through an exercise in preparing to quit smoking, right?

A    I don't know about that.  He tried a lot of different ways to quit smoking.  Some of them were counterproductive over the years.

Q    Mr. Shulman quit smoking without having the assistance of a physician to help him properly use medications, correct ?

A    I think he did use the nicotine gum.

Q    Mr. Shulman denied that he used nicotine gum, right?

A    What?

Q    He denied that he used nicotine gum in his deposition, right?

A    No, that's not correct.

Q    We'11 show that in a minute.

A    He talks about it in a certified medical exam, I know that.

Q    Mr. Shulman quit smoking without choosing a quit date, correct?

Page 5802 A    Maybe he backed into it.  I don't know if

he had in his mind a date that he was going to do it.

Q    So you don't know whether he did any of

these things?

A    No, because I didn't work with him.  He didn't have the benefit of professional help.  He had to figure out how to do it himself.

Q    Sir, you would agree, with respect to making a serious quit attempt, it is important to be smoke free for one day, right?

A    If you can be smoke free for one day, that's a prognostic sign that you can do it for a year.  But the people who can't get a day are the people who are more seriously addicted who have given up hope or are having serious problems.  If you can get a day, you're one of the lucky ones.

Q    Because if you can be smoke free for one day, you can be smoke free every day, right?

A    It's a good prognostic sign if you can get a day.  The most likely outcome of every quit attempt is relapse.  That is the unfortunate reality.  It's 75 percent try and 3 percent succeed every year. Seventy-five percent want to do it.  Three percent do it.

Q    Sir, this is going to be � I think you

Answer:  Is that a guarantee?  Obviously not.

Did I read that correctly?

Sir, did I read that correctly?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Line 20 of the next page, Mr. Furr, all the way down.  Keep going to line 20, page 155, please.

MR. FURR:  That's not related to the question I asked.  I disagree, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Why don't you approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR: Sir, if you look at the previous page, that's the question -- that's highlighted, that's the question and answer I read. He now wants me to read down to page 20, the next page. I think it's a different subject matter and it's not the rule of completeness.

THE COURT:  Which is the line that you actually read?

MR. FURR:  The previous page, the highlighted.

THE COURT:  Do you deny that you have

Page 5805 written if you can be smoke free for one day --

and you want him to read what?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I want him to continue after the answer.  If you read the next question and answer, it goes all the way down to line 20 on page 155.  If you keep reading, it's right on point about whether or not you can quit one day for every day.  It's the exact same thing.

THE COURT:  You want � the question I didn't say guarantee, is that what you --

MR. BRENNER:  Right, right.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, all the way down. You can -- it says here:  You can certainly be smoke free every day, true?

And it says Answer:  It's not true.  It's not true.  Not true.  It's not a guarantee at all.

Then he explains why.  So that's, the total context is that every day --

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, which line do you want, 155, line 5?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  155, line 2 through line 5, and then it continues down to line 20.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let me see here.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me.  You don't tell me what to do, Mr. Schlesinger.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sorry.

MR. FURR:  The next question is a totally different question.  It's about nine months.  It's about pregnant women.

THE COURT:  You want him to read �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He can just read � Judge, just to make it simple, 155 through line 5.  He can stop there and that's it.  That's every day.  That's the same question and answer. It's right in context.

Is that a guarantee?

Obviously not.

If you can be smoke-free for nine months, you certainly can be smoke-free every day, true?

Answer:  It's not true.  It's not true.

We can stop there and make it simple.

MR. FURR:  It's not related to the question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's right on the everyday question.

THE COURT:  All right.

THE COURT:  What happens is � the rule of completeness, the way I understand it, maybe I'm missing something here, but the way I understand the rule of completeness � I don't pick sides.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  I'm trying to follow what the law formally says.  The way I understand the rule of completeness is that if a witness continues to give an answer in his deposition, and you only read part of it, you can read the rest of the answer.

Here, he's already finished giving his answer.  He's starting a whole new thing.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Actually, I think the rule of completeness is if the context --

THE COURT:  You can use it on redirect because you can use an expert's deposition for any purpose.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.  Rule of completeness is not for making sure you read the whole answer; that you have to do.

Rule of completeness is if you read a question and answer that is out of context and

Page 5808 they say smoke free every day, and the very next

question is can you be smoke free � you

certainly can be smoke free for every day, true

and then he says answer, it's not true, it's not

true, that's right on point.

The one he wanted to read is can you be smoke free every day.

He says, In theory, you have the potential.

Then they say � and then he says, It's not a guarantee.  It's obviously not a guarantee.

Then they say, If you can be smoke free for nine months, you can certainly be smoke free every day, true.

Then he says, It's not true.  It's not true.  So it's right on the every day.

THE COURT:  It's a different question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's only one more line. It's only one more line.

MR. FURR:  It's getting into the pregnancy issue.

request for rule of completeness on this one?

MR. FURR:  May I proceed, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Dr. Seidman, you talked about this

on direct examination.  But based upon the record

that we have reviewed, the longest that Mr. Shulman

ever went without smoking before he ultimately quit

for good was 14 or 15 hours on one occasion, correct?

A    Yes, that's correct.

Q    Before Mr. Shulman threw his cigarettes

away and quit, he had never gone more than 24 hours

without smoking, correct?

A    Correct.  As far as I know, yeah, as far as

I read.

Q    So, sir, we know that, based upon the

Page 5810 record, that the one time that Mr. Shulman went

longer than 24 hours without smoking, he quit and

never smoked again, right?

A    Well, there's a lot of uncertainty about when he quit, whether he quit in '75, '85, '90, '95, it's not clear exactly what happened in all those quit attempts.

Q    Okay.  I didn't ask you about the years yet.

A    But at some point, we do know that he quit. Either he smoked 40 years, 50 years or 60 years.  And we know he got sick from it.  But we don't know exactly what happened in all of those quits.  We know that he's not smoking now.

Q We know that the one time that he went 24 hours without smoking, he did successfully quit and never smoked again, right?

A    No.  We don't know what happened -- he says that he quit in the mid '80s to the late '80s.  His son said he quit when he got cancer.  So, you know, he struggled with this mightily.  He struggled with this over a long period of time.  And so, no, that's not a simple answer for you.

Q    Okay.  We are going to look at what the record evidence shows about his quit attempts before

Page 5811 we complete today.

Sir, you would agree that some smokers

simply don't want to quit, correct?

A    I think there are some out there.  And I think a lot of them just have given up, that they feel they can't do it, so they say they don't want to do it.  That's my personal belief.  Most of them --90 percent say that they wish they never started, and consistently year, year, year after year, 75 percent say they wish they could quit.  So yeah, if 75 percent say they wish they could quit, some of them say they don't want to quit or fail to quit.

Q    So if 75 percent say they wish they could quit, I guess 25 percent of them are not saying they wish they could quit, right?

A    That's what it says in the surveys.

Q    Sir, you acknowledge that smoking is pleasurable for many people, correct?

A    It's pleasurable for a minority of the people I see.  Most of the people I see hate it and don't know how to get out of it and smoke just to feel normal.  So there's a minority of people who do get pleasure out of it later in their smoking careers.  When they start, sure, there is a pleasurable element.  Some of it has to do with doing

Q    Do you acknowledge that smoking is

pleasurable for many people?

A    Not the ones I see.  If 90 percent of them wish they hadn't started, it can't feel that good.

Q    Haven't you previously written that smoking is pleasurable for many people?

A    It depends when in their smoking career. When you're a teenager, the reward is greater, the withdrawal is less.  When you get deeper into your 20s and 30s and 40s, the withdrawal is worse and the pleasure is less.  So it draws you in and then it doesn't feel good.  Then you're just doing it to stay even.  That's my experience.

MR. FURR:  I propose to show the doctor this .

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me look up the page. One second.

MR. FURR:  Any objection?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm just looking.  Let me make sure I have it.  Sure.

Page   5813 clinician's  Guide,   right?

A         Yes.

Q    I want to look at something from that book. Please read along with me, sir.  Is it correct that in your book for other doctors to use, you wrote, with respect to smoking, It is used as a tension reducer in anxiety-provoking situations.  It is also pleasurable for many people, and this pleasure is reinforced when smoking accompanies activities such as a meal, coffee or sex.  The constant repetition of smoking behavior many times per day involves tremendous habit strength and conditioning, and can become an automatic part of life, a ritual.  In fact, smoking behavior is so overlearned that smokers often light up a cigarette and let it burn down in an ashtray without even realizing it.

You wrote those words, didn't you, sir?

A    I believe so.

Q And you believe that the statements contained here were true when you wrote them, correct?

A    I did believe them when I wrote them, yeah, and I believe most of it now.

Q   Okay.

completeness, can we read from the next page the

inset quote from 1985?

MR. FURR:  I don't have it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I have it.

MR. FURR:  Can I see it?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.  That's the very

next page.

MR. FURR:  No, we have to show Your Honor

this.  Do you want to argue this?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I can do a redirect, or

you can do it now.

MR. FURR:  You can do it on redirect.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.  Fair enough.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.

A    You know -- there's no question, so I'll

wait.

Q    Okay, sir.  I want to ask you

some different questions about smoking in general.

You and Mr. Schlesinger have talked about

urges and cravings, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that the action

that a smoker takes in response to urges and cravings

A    You know, I love the way you pick and

choose out of my writings �

Q    Excuse me, sir.  Do you agree?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I think he's

allowed to answer.

MR. FURR:  I don't think he's allowed �

THE COURT:  The witness was kind of making

an editorial comment and that's really not

appropriate.

You need to answer the guestions that are

posed to you, sir.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'm sorry, can you

repeat the guestion.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Do you remember the question?

A    No.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that you agree that the

action a smoker takes in response to urges and

cravings is a choice?

A    Yes, I think that they tend to do certain

things, but they can't do it because of their

addiction.  So that's � my job is to help them

implement the choices that they want to make in

relation to this.  If they could do it, I wouldn't

and quit, then I certainly wouldn't have a job.

Q    Sir, would you agree that when an urge is not acted on, no matter how powerful that urge is, the urge occurs less often and becomes easier to ignore?

A    If someone can do that.

Q    Okay.  Sir, wouldn't you agree that, in your own words, you have stated that a cigarette does not have any magical power unless the smoker gives power to the cigarette?

A    But because of the addiction, they do give power to the cigarette.  The cigarette has power over them.  Their autonomy is diminished and compromised because precisely because of the product itself.

Q    Okay.  Sir, you told us yesterday about an online app that you have to help smokers quit, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    One part of that app is called Up In Smoke, correct?

A    That's the name of the app.

Q    And one of the videos on that app is titled Protect Your Body, correct?

A    Yes.

with quitting smoking, right?

A    No.  There are over 100 videos, so I hope you're not picking and choosing.

MR. FURR:  I propose to show that application.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I need to approach.  I have no problem showing it as long as we show the other ones.  I want to put it in context with the rule of completeness. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, Internet multimedia is giving the courtroom transcripts, but this witness has got an app on the iPhone. I can show it to you.  It's got hundreds of videos that all run together.  They want to pull out one of the videos, about a one-minute video.

I have no problem with them playing it as long as rule of completeness, I can play the other video that is relevant to this issue in context now, so the jury can see it together. Each one is about a minute.

I can show you both, and you can make the decision, or, alternatively, if Your Honor is of the mind of just making me do it on redirect,

preference would be, I think, rule of

completeness, I've got another video.  I know

the video he wants to play.  It's a one-minute,

give or take, clip.  I've got a one-minute clip.

I think they should both be played together in

fairness to avoid miscontextualization.

MR. FURR:  I haven't seen these clips.  We should look at that on a break.  If it's relevant, then he could play it on redirect. But my cross-examination should not be broken up for him to play other apps that I haven't seen.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Then he can wait on this until you make a decision.

MR. FURR:  No, I'm impeaching him now, Judge.

THE COURT:  What was the objection, other than rule of completeness?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yeah, rule of completeness only.  He's got a section of the video from the phone app �

THE COURT: You want me to see it so I know whether it's rule of completeness? Is that what you are saying to me?

I have no problems if you do it on

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They've seen every one of them, Judge.  They have gone through every single video on his app, every one of them.

THE COURT:  I don't know the rule of completeness � that goes to a transcript.  I've never heard of rule of completeness used on a video.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's because this is cutting-edge stuff.  This is a phone app.  It's the same principle.

THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule and have you do it on redirect.

Go.

Q    Dr. Seidman, I want to look at one of your

online apps titled Protect Your Body.

MR. FURR:  Would you play that clip? (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Urges and cravings to smoke are not choices.  However, the action you take in response to the urges and cravings is a choice. The cigarette has no magical power except what you give it.  When not acted on, urges to smoke, no matter how powerful, occur less often and become easier to ignore.

By not acting on the urge to smoke, you chose voluntarily to protect your body and your health.  You chose not to act on the urge to smoke because you truly believe this will make life better. (Thereupon, the video clip ended.) BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Seidman, easy question.

Q    Three times within that one-minute application we played, you used the word "choice," didn't you?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Well, can you read the next question and answer?  Just finish the page, please.

MR. FURR:  No, I'm not going to do that. It was objected to in this trial and kept out. It was stricken by the trial judge.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ask your next question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I want to approach.

MR. FURR:  The trial judge struck that second question and answer.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, he struck it from the jury in that case under that set of circumstances.  That's like saying what some other judge's ruling is, is binding on you.  He wanted to use a transcript.  This is sworn testimony that he gave.  It was stripped from the trial record in another case in another context with a whole other set of circumstances.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  But that's sworn testimony that is in the context.  It's not fair to use something to impeach someone who has given a completed answer.  In this setting, it's perfectly appropriate to use it.  It may not have been appropriate for the other jury.

MR. FURR:  Here is why it's important.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  In this case just now, this witness asked Mr. Furr the same question, what is your denominator?  He said 60 million people.  And he said to Mr. Furr, over what period of time, and then he said, okay, I'm going to impeach you.

statistics that you're familiar with.

that between 1966, when the cautionary label went on,

and 1970, that 13 million people quit in the United

States, right?

time.  A lot of people went on to the filters

instead.

Can I approach?

1970

A

Yes

Q    I believe you also told Mr. Schlesinger that you agree that there are more ex-smokers in the United States today than current smokers, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  Different topic.

I want to ask you about regular smokers, okay?  You define a regular smoker as someone who smokes every day, correct?

A    Well, I don't use the term "regular smoker."  That's not my term.

MR. FURR:  Could I have the Irimi deposition from January 14, 2013? May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Seidman, let me ask you first to confirm for us that this is a copy of the sworn testimony that you gave in your deposition in the Irimi trial on January 14, 2013. A    Yes.

A

Yes

Q    Sir, is it true that you were asked this question and gave this answer:

Question:  Can you define a regular smoker? Answer:  Somebody who smokes every day. Did I read that question and answer correctly?

A    They asked if I can define it.  I said that's how I would define it.  It's not a term I use all the time.  I talk about six different kinds of smokers.  I don't use the term "regular smoker." They asked me to define it �

Q    Did I read that question and answer correctly?

A    -- and that's how I defined it.

Q    Did I read that question and answer correctly?

A    Yes, you did.

Q    Thank you.

Sir, would you agree that about one half of the regular smokers meet the criteria for nicotine dependence?

A    Well, in DSM-IV, 90 percent of them met it. In DSM-V, 50 percent.  That's why people have some questions about DSM.  But it depends how you measure

Q    Let me talk about how � the types of information that you need to diagnose whether someone is nicotine dependent, okay?

You would agree that, just because someone smokes a pack a day for many years, that does not mean that they are nicotine dependent, right?

A    No, I wouldn't agree with that.  The chance that you can smoke a pack every day and not be nicotine dependent are very small.

MR. FURR:  Can I have the Irimi deposition

from December 17, 2012?

I believe everybody has this. BY MR. FURR:

Q    It might take you a moment to find it, Dr. Seidman.  This is your December 17, 2012 deposition in Irimi.

Let me know when you have that, sir.

A    That's the one I was just looking at, right?

Q    No.  That was trial testimony we looked at.

A    Yeah, I may have it.  What's the first page?

A    Let me see if I've got it.  Okay. Q    I want to look at 220, lines 13 through 221, line 8 on the next page.

MR. GDANSKI:  What were the lines? MR. FURR:  220.  We'll begin at line 13 and we will read through 221, line 8 on the next page.

MR. GDANSKI:  We object.  That's more than one question.

Answer:  I'd have to know more about that

person.

Did I read that question and answer correctly?

A    Yes.

Q    You would want to know about their patterns of smoking, right, sir?

A    I would want to know a lot more about a person.  I don't like to diagnose someone that I haven't met or studied extensively or something like that.  I would have a lot of questions about it.

Q    You'd have a lot more questions about that person, right?

A    Yes.  Nonetheless it's very unlikely that someone smokes a pack a day without some level of addiction.

Q    There's no question pending.

A    I'm finishing my answer.

Q    There is no question pending.  It was, did I read it correctly.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, you have to

look at the transcript to see that it was the

appropriate back and forth.  There's no �

nothing inappropriate �

THE COURT:  I will strike the last answer

given by the witness.  The jury should disregard

it. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, I want to talk with you about an aspect of the DSM-V.  Because during your direct examination, on multiple occasions, you talked about the limitations of using the DSM-V for diagnosing nicotine dependence.

Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that when you make a diagnosis for nicotine addiction in a patient, that you use the DSM-V?

A    Well, I use it, you know, after I've done an interview.  I don't sit there and fill it out.  I do an interview and then I get what I need.  Usually you need a diagnosis like that for administrative purposes, not so much for clinical purposes.

all the time, don't you?

A    Are you asking me or telling me?

Q    I'm asking you.

A    No.  I don't refer to it all the time.  I know the criteria.  I know what it looks like.  I do my interviews and I do make a diagnosis.  But that's not � I look at the Fagerstrom, I look at other sources.  I look at my own experience.  I don't rely on it solely and I won't do that.  I wouldn't think that was a good idea.

MR. FURR:  Could I have the doctor's

deposition in this case from February 16th of

this year?

May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Seidman, let me ask you to first confirm for us that that is a transcript of the deposition that you gave in Mr. Shulman's case, the case that we're here in on February 16, 2015.

Q    Let me ask you to turn to page 600, line 25.

A    I am.

Q    Question:  I'm sorry you feel that way, but

when is the last time you used the DSM-V to assess

someone for nicotine addiction in your clinical

practice?

Your answer was:  I refer to it all the

time.  You know, it might be one of the � any time

that I have a patient that I have to make a

diagnosis, I'll think about that, as well as any

other diagnosis I have to make.

Did I read that question and answer

correctly?

A

Yes

Q    Thank you.

The DSM-V has, as you and Mr. Schlesinger discussed, has 11 criteria that you must consider to evaluate whether a particular patient has the tobacco use disorder, right?

A    Correct.

Q    Sir, you would agree that under the DSM, a smoker must demonstrate clinically significant impairment or distress for that diagnosis to be made, correct?

A    That's how it's defined by the DSM in the clinical setting.

Q    Sir, you mentioned on direct examination that one of the instruments that you used in this case was a Fagerstrom test, right?

A    Correct.

Q    Well, sir, you don't know whether the Fagerstrom test has ever been validated for use by someone who smoked in the past, right?

A    It's the only way you can make a measurement � it's the most reliable, valid measurement that we have for nicotine and it has been used for reviewing people in the past.  That's what I do with it.  I get referred a lot of people who quit

later they're still suffering from it.  I go back and

do a Fagerstrom and figure out what their nicotine

dependence level was.  It is the most reliable way to

predict what's going to happen to people when they

quit smoking.  Much more than the DSM.  That's what's

used in research.  That's why nicotine researchers

use it and they don't use the DSM.

which one it is.

Q    When you find it �

A    It's a deposition?

Q   Yes, sir.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  What page?

MR. GDANSKI:  He's explaining himself. MR. FURR:  Move to strike. MR. GDANSKI:  It's the truth. THE COURT:  I will grant the motion to strike.  The jury should disregard the additional answers that the witness gave.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Rule of completeness, can you read page 395, line 24 through 396, line 6, please?

MR. FURR:  Sure. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Did you hear that, Dr. Seidman?

A    Yes.

Q    We'll go to 395, line 24.

Question:  By the way, you agree, don't you, the Fagerstrom test is designed to be asked of a person who is currently smoking, correct?

Your answer was:  I'm not sure about that. I mean, I think that you can do it by history also.

Q    Now, one of the instruments that you used in this case to evaluate Mr. Shulman was something called the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Sir, in fact, that's not an instrument that you have used in your own practice, is it?

A    Well, I do now.  I'm interested in it now, but I don't necessarily use any of these instruments because I've been doing this for 25 years.  I don't sit there filling out forms when I'm seeing a patient.  I'm listening for -- I have a baseline of whether -- what kind of things I'm looking for.  I'm listening to the story.  I'm not filling out checklists.

Q    Sir, when you began � the way that you � let me strike that.

You didn't even know about the existence of the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist until Mr. Gdanski

Page 5841 told you about it, right?

A    Yeah.  I was -- I've been very interested in it since they told me about it because it captures some important features of the loss of autonomy of smokers because of the product that they use.

Q    But you don't use this Hooked on Nicotine Checklist in your clinical practice, do you?

A    That doesn't mean I'm not interested in the whole question of autonomy.

Q    Sir, my question is, you don't use it in your clinical practice, do you?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I object, Judge.  That

was an unfair interruption.  I think the witness

was giving a very brief responsive answer.  I

think that was an unfair interruption. THE COURT:  The Judge ruled. Overruled. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, you don't use the Hooked On Nicotine Checklist in your clinical practice, do you?

A    I deal with the subject matter of that without filling it out.  I don't fill it out, but I deal with what it measures, because I'm interested in what it measures.  I think it's a very important part of the problem.

Page 5842 Q   You learned about it because when you got a

call from the Schlesinger law firm, you were new to

this kind of work and Mr. Gdanski told you, hey, you

might want to look at this, right?

A    I looked at every kind of measurement there was when I started doing this work because I wanted to do a good job.  That's one of the things that they brought out, sure, but that doesn't mean I haven't been interested in that subject matter in my whole career, which I have.

Q    Was what I said correct?

A    I think we said yesterday that they are the ones that told me about that particular instrument.

Q    Okay.

A    We said it yesterday.

Q    And I want to be clear, sir, you don't use the Fagerstrom instrument and the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist in your clinical practice because they're mainly for research, correct?

A    Anybody in the field is aware of those things.  Time to first cigarette, number of cigarettes per day, anybody is going to get that information.  You don't have to be a researcher to want that information.

That's the problem with the DSM.  It

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Seidman, we're now going to look at

your trial testimony in Irimi.  It's the one that

begins on page 3237 of that trial.  I'm going to ask

you to look at � in order to get all of this, we're

going to have to go from 3319, line 12 through 3319,

line 25.

Are you there?

MR. GDANSKI:  3319 through?

Q    Are you there?

A    I am, but I'm having trouble reading the

MR. GDANSKI:  This is about nicotine.

THE COURT:  Does somebody have something

with bigger print for the witness?

THE WITNESS:  I think I can look at it.

It's just going to take me a minute.

Q   Are you there, sir? A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  Isn't it true that in your sworn testimony in the Irimi trial you were asked this question and gave this answer:

Question:  Now, speaking of the test, it's true that the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist that you did was a test that Mr. Gdanski sent you, correct?

Answer:  I was looking around for different things.  He said you might want to look at this because I was new to this kind of work.

Question:  And that test, the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, that's not one that you used in your private practice.  It's one that you got from Mr. Gdanski.  Correct?

Answer:  I don't use most of these in my private practice.  They're mainly for research. They're not for experienced clinicians necessarily in

Did I read that question and answer

correctly?

A    Yes, that's fine.

Q    Okay.  I want to talk in a little bit of detail about withdrawal symptoms.

Sir, you would acknowledge, wouldn't you, that many smokers have exaggerated expectations of how difficult it's going to be to quit smoking?

A    Yeah.  I think -- well, half of the smokers don't even have withdrawal, significant withdrawal. It's a lot easier than they think.  They're afraid to try and they avoid it.  If you can get them to try, it's not as hard as they think.  And yet they still go back for other reasons.  But it is true, what you said.

Q    Do you also agree that many doctors needlessly exaggerate the difficulty of nicotine withdrawal?

A    Well, they've scared everybody into thinking that they can't do it.  That's part of the problem, so they don't try.

Q   Do you agree that that's a problem?

A    Yeah.  Some people don't have the problem. Some people have extreme withdrawal.  Some people

Page 5846 have very little withdrawal.  It's important not to

lump those people together.  That's a major point

that I'm trying to make today.

Q In fact, sir, you would agree that many smokers fail to quit because the fear of quitting prevents them from even getting started, right?

A    That's one of the biggest problems with the whole field, is that people, when they fail, they go into a bunker, they lose their confidence.  And confidence is about two-thirds of what it takes to quit.  If you lose your confidence and you're afraid to try, then you avoid the whole subject, and that's a big problem that we have to deal with.

Q    Sir, you would agree that a lot of the failure of smokers to quit results from exaggerated, irrational, phobic fear, correct?

A    I have -- one of the kinds of smokers that I talk about are the ones who are afraid to try to quit because they're like a stripped gear.  Because they've tried and failed, and we know that once they've failed, it's harder the next time.

Because what happens when you fail, when your efforts and your outcome don't align, people are afraid to keep trying.

Q    So do you agree with that statement?

Q    Sir, you do agree, don't you, that when smokers get around to the quit date, it's literally never as bad as they feared it would be if they prepare and follow through?

A    Well, I'm making that statement to a general audience of all of the smokers.  That's in a self-help book.  That's not for people like Mr. Shulman who are in the top group of highly addicted people.  That's for the general audience of all smokers.  So that statement, it's confusing to people because if you �

Q    Dr. Seidman, you spoke earlier about your 2011 book Smoke Free in 30 Days:  The Pain Free Permanent Way to Quit, right?

A    Yes.

Q    I have an excerpt from page 6 of the introduction.

Keep in mind before you quit:  Many smokers fail to quit because the fear of quitting prevents them from even getting started.  Like people learning to ride a bike, they are focused more on trying not to fall down than on getting up and riding.  For most people, once you get past the fall-down stage, your confidence goes way up, even if there are a few bumps along the way.  A lot of the failure that smokers experience results from exaggerated, irrational, phobic fear.  When they do get around to the quit day, it is literally never as bad as they feared if they prepare and follow through based on the

A    You did.  I'm trying to give people hope in that statement.

Q    Those are your words?

A    That's right.  I'm trying to give people hope that they can do it.

Q    There's no question pending.  I'm asking for follow-up, those are your words, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay, sir.  As you have told us, you worked in your practice with many hard-core smoking addicts, correct?

A    All kinds of addicts, including hard-core addicts.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that even among the hard-core smoking addicts that you treat, many of them � excuse me � more often than not, many of them are surprised about how easy day one is of their quitting smoking?

A    Yes, because I'm treating them.  These are not out -- they're coming to a psychologist and they're getting medicines and they're getting a lot of things that most people don't have access to because smoking cessation treatment in this country

Page 5850 is not funded.  So this is something that I'm doing,

which is an unusual situation, providing them with a

professional service of a psychologist.  Most people

don't get that.

Q    Among the patients you treat, more than 50 percent of the hard-core smoking addicts are pleasantly surprised by how easy day one is for them, right ?

A    If they're on medicine, if they're on combined nicotine replacement, if they're working with a psychologist, yes, they have a much better chance of doing it.  That doesn't mean I can help everybody, because I can't and I'm not going say I can.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that there are smokers who are nicotine dependent, yet when they quit, they experience no withdrawal?

A    Yes, that does happen.  Yes, that happens for mild cases, sure.

Q    Wouldn't you agree that a smoker can be heavily dependent and still not experience significant withdrawal symptoms when that person quits smoking?

A    There's 45 million smokers and there's a lot of variety of what happens when they try to quit.

come to me, I assume I'm going to do everything I can

to help them quit and give them hope that they can do

it.  And some of them can and some of them can't.

Q    Sir, do you agree with the statement I just read to you?  Do you remember what it was?

A    No.

Q    Do you agree that a smoker can be heavily dependent and still not experience significant withdrawal symptoms when that person quits smoking?

A    Part of the definition is withdrawal. Sometimes they don't have it, that's true.  Sometimes they don't have serious withdrawal.  They may have some manageable symptoms.

Q    I'm sorry?

A    They may have some manageable, easy symptoms, especially if they're on some kind of medicine.

A    Yes.

Q   Sir, isn't it true you were asked this

question and gave this answer?

Question:  A smoker can be heavily

dependent and still not experience significant

withdrawal when he quits smoking, true?

Your answer was:  Yeah, there are different

patterns of dependency.

Did I read that question and answer

correctly?

A    Yes.

Q   Thank you.

I wanted to talk a little bit more about

withdrawal.  I want to talk about the timing of

withdrawal, the time course of withdrawal, okay?

Sir, wouldn't you agree that when a smoker

quits smoking, that the nicotine is out of their body

in two or three days?

A    Yes.

Page 5853 Q    Wouldn't you agree that, generally

speaking, for smokers, the withdrawal symptoms will

peak within 72 hours?

A    Well, sometimes it's -- there's a lot of variability in it from an individual point of view. It says that in certain places, but my own experience, sometimes it goes up after a few weeks. Sometimes it gets worse.  And in about ten percent of smokers, it doesn't stop even after a month.  It goes on for months.  So there's very different patterns, like I just said, the quote that you put out there. There are different patterns to this.

about 72 hours, right?

Your answer was:  It's true for many

people, yes.

Did I read that question and answer

correctly?

A    Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can you read line 8 � on

2953, lines 8 through 23, please.

MR. FURR:  Sure.  Counsel has asked me to

read line 8 -- I guess you want line 9 which is

an answer.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  2953, line 8 is where the

question begins.

MR. FURR:  Sure.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    We're going to back up to line 8 on the

previous page.

A    Okay.

Answer:  Well; there's a tremendous amount of variability within that.  So if you're lumping together things that don't belong together,   hard-core smokers, low-dependent smokers, and you put it together,   there's going to be more people who are going to peak in the first week.  But one of the surprises is it goes up and down.  And then you have people with a prolonged withdrawal; which doesn't get better and doesn't get easier and doesn't peak within the first week.  So there's a lot of variability. Now, I think by lumping everybody together; it's very misleading.  So I think it's important to state that.

Question:  Well; thank you for saying that; but here is my question:  Generally speaking; for most smokers; the withdrawal symptoms will peak within about 72 hours, right?

Answer:  It's true for many people; yes.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

A    Yes.

Q   Sir, do you agree that for most smokers within a few weeks most of the nicotine withdrawal symptoms are gone when they quit?

A    I would say by a month 90 percent of the

Q    In fact, you'd say within two to four weeks they're in pretty good shape, right?

A    Yeah, something like that.

Q    Now, we compared � you compared a bit nicotine addiction to addiction to other substances during your direct examination.  I just want to be clear, sir, withdrawal from nicotine is not the type of potentially life-threatening medical problem that withdrawal from alcohol can be, correct?

A    Yes, that's true.  Alcoholics may find it harder to quit smoking than they do alcohol, but it's not life-threatening to quit nicotine.

Q    Okay.  I want to now turn closer to examining more of your testimony with respect to Mr. Shulman specifically.

I want to make sure we begin by understanding what you reviewed in this case to prepare to testify, okay?

A    Yes.

Q    When you were hired by Mr. Schlesinger's firm, you had never met Mr. Shulman, right?

A    No.

Q    I believe you told us you met him yesterday for the first time, right?

Page 5857 A    That's correct, yeah.

Q    In preparation to testify in this case, you

read Mr. Shulman's deposition, right?

A    There are 12 volumes of it.

Q    Am I correct you read his deposition?

A    I read all 12 volumes of it.

Q    You know why there are 12 volumes, don't you?

A    Yeah.  Yeah, because he's � it was hard for him to be under deposition.

Q    Because he's 95 years old.

A    Because he's 95 years old, that's right. I'm just saying there's a lot of it there.

Q    If you want to talk about the 12 volumes, I want to explore with you why there are 12 volumes.

You know that during these depositions Mr. Shulman always had one of these lawyers, Mr. Hammer or someone else, representing him at those depositions, right?

A    That's standard for all depositions.

Q    You reviewed those depositions, right?

A    I did review them.

Q    You also saw that any time Mr. Hammer or any other lawyer for Mr. Shulman said that they wanted to terminate the deposition for the day

	Mr. Shulman didn't feel well, that the

	Even though some of those depositions

	lasted a very short period of time because
	
11
	Mr. Shulman had had a bad night or wasn't feeling
	
12

13

	Do you remember how old Mrs. Shulman is?

Q    And you reviewed the deposition of Mr. Shulman's living son, Harvey, correct, two volumes, I think.

A    Yes.

Q    And you reviewed � excuse me?

A    Two volumes, I believe.

Q    You reviewed the deposition of Mr. Shulman's deceased son's ex-wife, Marcia Shulman, correct?

A    Correct.

Q    And you reviewed a CD on which the plaintiff's counsel provided you medical records, right ?

A    Correct.

Q    Finally, you spoke with Mr. Shulman briefly on the phone for somewhere between five and 10 minutes, correct?

A    Yeah, we had a very brief talk.

Q One of the things you did not do is you did not complete a clinical interview of Mr. Shulman, did you?

A    Well, I'm working in a trial.  I'm not working as a clinical psychologist.  It's not a patient/doctor relationship.  I had an interview

Page 5860 because I had questions and I wanted to fill in some

blanks, but it wasn't what you'd call a clinical

interview.

Q    Well, you interviewed him only on a few very narrow topics, correct?

A    I said five or ten minutes, and that's what we did.

Q    During your interview, you asked Mr. Shulman whether he smoked when he was sick, right ?

A    I did ask him that, and he said yes.

Q    You did not ask Mr. Shulman any questions from the Fagerstrom test, did you?

A    That is a question from the Fagerstrom test, by the way.

Q    You did not ask Mr. Shulman any questions from the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, did you?

A    I think they were all -- if I had my answers already, I wouldn't have asked him about it. I asked him what I had questions about.

Q    You really only discussed two topics with Mr. Shulman, one of those being whether he was smoking while sick, the other topic being something that's of no relevance to this lawsuit, right?

A    That may be.  I'm not sure what else came

Q    Let me ask it this way:  Everything that

you learned about Mr. Shulman was in the context of

this lawsuit, correct?

A    By reading the depositions, I think that's the standard way that I would learn.  I don't know how else I would learn about it in a lawsuit.  That's the only way you can learn about it.

Q    Okay.  I want to go back and ask you some follow-up questions on the testimony that you gave on direct examination related to specific aspects of Mr. Shulman's life, obviously focused on his pattern of smoking over time, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    Because you and Mr. Schlesinger talked about how Mr. Shulman began smoking, right?

A    Yes, we did.

Q    And Mr. Shulman began smoking because he wanted to belong to the group and he wanted to look cool, right?

A   He wanted to be cool and he wanted to belong.  He wanted to see what it was all about, and he forced himself to smoke daily because he wanted to be part of it.

Q    He wanted to be part of the group, right?

A

That's what he said

Q In fact, Mr. Shulman testified that there were no other reasons that he started smoking other than to be cool and be part of the group, right?

A    It was perceived as cool.  So wherever that came from, but yes, it was perceived as a cool thing to do.

Q    He said there were no other reasons he started smoking.

A He was in a social environment where it was perceived as cool to smoke. For whatever reason that happened, I don't know.

Q    Is my statement correct?

A    Yeah.  He thought it was a cool, popular way to belong.  That's a very typical way that people start smoking.

Q There were no other reasons that he started smoking for, right ?

A    I don't know.  I can't think of any at the moment.

Q    Okay.  Isn't it true that when Mr. Shulman started to smoke, it was because his older friends were smoking?

A No. He went out in recess when he was 14 years old.  The kids were smoking.  He wanted to be

Page 5863 part of it, and that's how he started.  From the way

the story is told, that they were out there smoking

and he took one of the cigarettes and he coughed and

they all laughed at him.  That's what happened.  Then

he wanted to prove he could do it, prove he could be

a man, prove he could be tough, and he did it every

day until he stopped coughing, until he stopped

getting sick from it.  Then he got himself addicted

within two months.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, can we approach, please?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  Hearsay.  It was prohibited.  Hearsay.  I object it's hearsay.

THE COURT:  You're using a party opponent's deposition?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, she's not a party.

MR. FURR:  She's not a party, but it's the information that he relied upon to form his opinion.  It's like he said here in the articles I relied on -- here are depositions I relied on.

I'm allowed to demonstrate to the jury that he's testifying inconsistently with the information that he relied upon.  This is impeachment.

hearsay.  They set that ground rule.  Your Honor

enforced it vigorously.  This is hearsay.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, whether something is hearsay or not depends on the purpose for which it's offered for.  At this point I'm offering this to show that this witness is testifying inconsistently with the very materials that he claimed to have reviewed, digested and relied upon to testify in this case.

How can I be prohibited from showing the jury, he's up here telling you X when the information that he read to prepare to testify says Y.

THE COURT:  It seemed to me that if the way this witness came about to come up with his conclusions, as opposed to the normal way, which is that somebody comes to your office and you do an evaluation and you treat them and you're a treating doctor � the way he did it was -- I did hear his testimony earlier that the way he came to his conclusions was reading these depositions.

door for you to come back on redirect.

MR. SCHLESINGER: No, no, then I would have done my whole direct differently, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You can still do it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He can ask if the record reflects or if there is evidence in the record of other folks that did other things or derived other information.  He can challenge him with the information.  He cannot read from the depo to them.  That is hearsay.  Your Honor strictly prohibited me from doing that.

THE COURT: You're going to have to ask the proper predicate questions to get to that point, obviously.

MR. FURR:  I will.

Page 5867 THE COURT:  Why are you saying we're not

going to finish this witness?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Because if we're going to sit around reading � you told me on direct -- I tried on direct � if I can't refer to the depos as they are hearsay, he can't refer to the depo, it's hearsay.  He can ask the witness if he had information in the record, if the evidence revealed from the record, but he can't quote from the page and line of the depo.  I was prohibited on hearsay.

THE COURT:  Again, I'll reverse the prior ruling and let you do it on � either reopen up cross or reopen up redirect.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's fundamentally unfair to do it that way because on direct, when we tried, we were blocked.  It looks like we withheld information from the jury because Your Honor had one ruling and now on cross of the same witness �

MR. FURR:  What we propose �

MR. GDANSKI: � Your Honor is � don't interrupt me. You get very, very tough when people interrupt you.

You can't have a different ruling on the

prejudicial to the parties to whom the first

witness was against.

THE COURT:  I'll reopen up direct.

MR. GDANSKI:  But it makes it look like � but he's challenging the witness for giving inconsistencies, which --

THE COURT:  You can say that all you want, but that's not the case.

MR. BRENNER:  I disagree entirely.  No, they can't on direct or redirect start reading from the depo.  There are different rules.  He is testing his reliance, which is like any other expert in the world.  So him telling you you acted unfairly is not correct.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure on direct that you would basically be allowed to do that.  He's trying to test where his conclusions came from.

MR. GDANSKI:  So what Mr. Brenner is saying now is that --

THE COURT:  If you want to test it, you can just put it on again.

MR. FURR:  I would like to give an example. This is like �

MR. GDANSKI:  There's no white noise.

MR. FURR:  This is just like the witness relying on a learned treatise on direct examination.  He can say he relied on it.  He can't read it because that's bolstering.

THE COURT:  Right, but once you get into it, that's going to open up the door for him to be able to do it.

MR. FURR:  I understand.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, can I just point something out to you?  This is what we talked about as far as silence as an admission.  In that same group of questioning she was asked --

THE COURT:  Are you trying to use silence as an admission?

MR. HAMMER:  Yes.  In fact, she was asked right here --

THE COURT:  Mr. Furr, are you trying to use silence as an admission, because I think that's not something --

MR. FURR:  No, I'm doing the opposite.

THE COURT:  What did she actually say?

MR. FURR:  What she testified that he started smoking �

THE COURT:  You can't do it on silence.

What I'm going to do is, she said that he started smoking because of his older friends --

MR. FURR:  � not silence as an admission.

THE COURT:  Do you have to run to the restroom?

THE WITNESS:  It wouldn't be a bad idea.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, when I'm trying to make a point, whenever we're trying to make a point, Mr. Furr gets in here and says I'm talking. That's fine for him to cut everybody else off. I take exception to that.  I started talking --

THE COURT:  I understand.  I really am not pleased with the way all of you guys have been doing that.  You all have been interrupting each other numerous times.  I'm not � actually, Mr. Hammer, I think is one that does it the least.  But just about every lawyer in this room has done that throughout this whole proceeding.

where it's asked about where she says his older

friends.

However, the two questions later:

Did Mr. Shulman ever tell you that he first tried cigarettes because his friends were older?

No.

THE COURT:  Are you going to get into that question?

MR. FURR:  No, I'm not doing that.

THE COURT:  He's not going to do that question, all right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Then what's the basis?

MR. HAMMER:  That's the whole issue, because the question before that is -- is that -- he's trying to bring out that he tried cigarettes because of his older friends, but she never had that conversation with Mr. Shulman. She didn't know him at the time that he tried to smoke cigarettes.

MR. FURR:  That's for redirect.

MR. HAMMER:  No, it's �

THE COURT:  Do you really think that this issue is that significant to this jury?

THE COURT:  You guys fight over some of the issues that I just � you know, they seem like red herrings to me.

MR. HAMMER:  You're right, except that I know what they're going to be doing.  If they're allowed to do this now, they're going to do this consistently with Mrs. Shulman's deposition where she did not have conversations with him about these topics, but they asked her questions about it and she was either guessing or giving her best estimate, and they can't do that. Because if they don't � if the witness doesn't have --

THE COURT: If they try to get into one of these where they're trying to use silence, then there is going to be an objection.

MR. FURR:  No, I'm not doing that.  We should address those as they come.

THE COURT:  And I probably will sustain those.

MR. HAMMER:  That's exactly what this is, Judge.  I've just asked you to read it in context, Judge, page 72.

THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

Page 5873 MR. HAMMER:  Read from I think it's line 2

down to line 20.  It puts it all in context that

she never had that conversation with him.

MR. FURR:  If you read lines 10 through 13, she tells you how she knows it.  She tells you how she knows it.  She met his friends.

THE COURT:  She said that she met his friends and -- he didn't tell her, but I guess the friends did.

MR. HAMMER:  You can't assume that.  See, that's the problem, Judge.  She might have known his friends.  She might have known him, but she didn't know him when he first tried cigarettes and she didn't ever have a conversation with Mr. Shulman.  And if she had a conversation with his friends, that's hearsay on hearsay.  So either way it's not admissible.  That's my point.  That's what they're going to try to do throughout Mrs. Shulman's deposition.

MR. FURR:  There's no objection to the deposition, Your Honor.  Mrs. Shulman says �

MR. HAMMER:  Actually, there was an objection.

MR. FURR:  No, there's not.  There's no objection in the deposition.

Page 5874 Mrs. Shulman says she knows it.

If they want to try to demonstrate � we don't know how she knows it because those follow-up questions weren't asked.  Then she knows it by virtue of having met his friends. That could give rise to any number of possibilities.

THE COURT: Well, but any way you look at it, this witness used that to come up with his conclusions.

MR. FURR:  Right.

THE COURT:  So he's trying to test what this witness thinks about these kind of concepts because it would be entirely -- it would be wholly unfair for this witness to be able to come up to whatever conclusion he wants, read this transcript and then not be able to question him on what it is � you know, did you rely upon this, and if so, then you're going to ask these follow-up questions.

MR. FURR:  He already told us he did.  We just got done from him saying he digested all of these.

THE COURT:  Right.  That question has been asked.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Doctor, we were talking about, to

use some of your terminology, the social environment

in which Mr. Shulman began smoking, okay.  As you

told us, Mrs. Shulman's deposition was one of the

sets of materials that you have digested in your

preparation to testify.

You've already told us that, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  Sir, isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman

testified that Mr. Shulman started to smoke

cigarettes because his older friends were smoking?

A    That was what she said, yeah.

Page 5877 Q    Okay.  Now, when Mr. Shulman first tried

cigarettes, he did not tell his parents that he had

tried the cigarettes because he didn't want to get in

trouble, right?

A    Because of the financial aspect, I think. Yeah, he was in trouble already in school, but he didn't go home and tell them the first day he tried it.

Q    Because he didn't want to upset them, right ?

A    That's an inference you can make.  He chose not to because most kids don't go home and say that, do they?

Q    I don't want to draw inferences.  That's what Mr. Shulman testified to in the depositions you read, right?

A    I think that's right, yes.

Q    Okay.  And it wasn't just a financial � I mean, Mr. Shulman testified that his mother thought that smoking was not for children, right?

A    Correct.

Q    Mr. Shulman testified that his mother thought that smoking was for people who were older, right ?

A    Yes.

Page 5878 Q    But he got caught by his parents.  They

came to recognize that he had been smoking, right?

A    Well, somebody on the roof saw him smoking, and they thought the tar might catch fire, and some of the people in the neighborhood were giving him cigarettes and his mother went and said don't do it. The school disciplined him and told the parents, yeah.

Q    Let's stick with the parents for just a moment.  When his parents learned he had been smoking, he testified that didn't go over big with my parents.  They really got on me after that.  Right?

A    That sounds about right.

Q    You mentioned this, but Mr. Shulman also testified that when he first � when he smoked that first cigarette, he got sick and choked and it was a bad experience, right?

A    Well, they all laughed at him when he choked.

Q    He got dizzy, right?

A    I think so.

Q    Okay.  Now, I want to go back to something that you mentioned on direct.  There was another episode where Mr. Shulman's mother learned that he was smoking because he was being given cigarettes by

A    That's right.

Q   Do you remember that?

A    Yes, I do.

Q   Mr. Shulman, as a teenager, used to go up and pump the organ for the Catholic church, right?

A    He did all kinds of jobs.

Q One of the interesting things he did was, just by virtue of pumping the organ, he learned how to say mass in Latin, right?

A    That was the story.

Q He said that the people in the neighborhood thought it was funny to hear a Jewish kid say mass in Latin, right?

A    And they gave him cigarettes for doing it.

Q   Mr. Shulman actually had a faculty with language his whole life.  Don't you know that from the medical records?

A    I don't know much about that, no.

Q   Did you see that Mr. Shulman speaks four languages?

A    I didn't see that.

Q   Now, when his mother learned that the people at the church would give him cigarettes for the work he was doing up there, she objected to it

A    Yes, she did.

Q    I want to talk to you next to see if � I want to explore with you the record as to how much Mr. Shulman smoked and when he quit smoking, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    Because, again, I have listened very carefully to what you've said on direct examination. And you said that, before filters, Mr. Shulman got up to two packs per day, right?

A    That was what I read in the depos.

Q    And you said that after filters he got up to 2.5 packs per day, right?

A    No, I did not say that.  I said he went above two packs a day.  He uses the word "incessantly" for his smoking at that point because he felt he couldn't get enough out of the filter, and he was agitated all the time, according to the report.  So he was smoking more than two-plus packs a day.  He didn't limit it in any way from what I read.

Q    Okay.  My mistake.

Two-plus packs per day, right?

A    Yes.

Q    You said that with respect to when Mr. Shulman quit, that the medical records were

MR. FURR:  Cliff, could you first pull up

2.296 in evidence. BY MR. FURR:

Q   You reviewed the medical records as you told us.  You got the medical records on a CD from plaintiff's counsel, right?

A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  See here, sir, this is a record from Mercy Hospital, right?  Mercy Hospital Department of Anesthesia, preoperative information, right?

A    Right.

Q   You see the record is from 8-22-95, right?

A    Yes.

Q   You see also, don't you, sir, that this is Mr. Shulman's signature at the bottom of the page, right ?

A    Okay.

Q   No reason to dispute that, do you?

A    No.

Q   You see he was asked, have you ever smoked cigarettes, if yes, how many packs per day? One.

How many years? 30.

Do you smoke now, right? A    Yes.

Q    So if he began smoking around 1945 at the age of 15 and he smoked for 30 � A    That would be 35. Q    Excuse me, thank you.

� thirty-five, and he smoked for 30 years, that would mean he smoked up to about 1965, right?

A    If that was correct, that's what it would mean, yeah.

Q    This was in his own handwriting, right? A    Yeah.  In the pre-op when he's going in for a big operation.  He wasn't really focusing on that, was he.

Q    You don't know what his mental status was then, do you?

A    It probably wasn't too good.

Page 5883 Q    You know that he was trying to provide the

best information he could to the anesthesiologist who

his life he was going to place in his hands, right?

A   Well, what he said, as opposed to what you're saying, is that he threw it out because he wanted to -- he didn't want to be talking about that. That's what he said.  And that it's incorrect.

Q    About this record?

A    About all these records.  Around the time of the pre-op he said he threw out a number and he just didn't want to deal with it.

Q    All right.  Let's look at it and see the pattern over time of how Mr. Shulman provided information to his doctors, okay?

A    Yes.

MR. FURR:  Let's next pull up 8774/75. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  You see this is another medical record dated 7-22-59.  It's actually a month earlier than the last record we looked at, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    It's a month earlier, so he is not filling out an anesthesia form.

Do you see this is from a Dr. Robert Smith, right ?

MR. FURR:  And let's pull up the social history. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Do you see here it says the patient is retired.  He is married with two sons.  He formerly owned a flying school in Beverly, Massachusetts.  He quit smoking about 20 years ago.  Right?

So that would mean that he quit �

In 1975.

1975, right?

Didn't the last one say he quit in 1965?

That was the calculation we did.

Right.  So this is ten years different than

A

Q

A

Q

A that one.

Q    Correct.

A    Okay.  So there's a discrepancy in the medical records.

MR. FURR:  Let's look at 2137/139. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  This is a medical record from Mercy Hospital.  It says Division of Nursing, admission assessment, from September 14, 1995.  In other words, a couple months later, right?

A    Boy, I can't see that writing, but okay.

A    Oh, okay.  Yes, sure.

Q    A couple months later, right?

A    Yeah.

MR. FURR:  Could we pull up the smoking

history? BY MR. FURR:

Q    Do you see it says, Social living habits, quit 20 years ago, right?

A    Right.  So that would put the quit in '75 again.

Q    That would again put it in 1975, right?

A    Right.

MR. FURR:  Let's pull up 288/92.  Could you

pull up the top? BY MR. FURR:

A    Yes.

Q    Do you know who Dr. Benedetto was and the role that he played in Mr. Shulman's treatment?

A    I'm sorry, I don't really remember much about it.

A    Okay.

MR. FURR:  Could we go to the social

history part? BY MR. FURR:

Q Okay. Under social history, it says, he smoked one pack of cigarettes a day until 20 years ago, right?

A    So all these records say he smoked for 40 years.  That's what they say.

Q    Excuse me?

A    If he smoked until 1975, he started in 1934, that's 40 years of smoking.  That's what they're all saying, right.

Q    You remember my question.  First, it says he smoked one pack of cigarettes a day, right?

A    That's what it's saying there, yeah.

Q Then it says until 20 years ago � which again would mean that he had quit in 1975, right?

A    Right.

A    Okay.

Q    Okay.  Let's go to the social history.  You see it says he hadn't smoked for 20 years, right?

So that means it's 1978? That would be 1978, correct?

So that means he was smoking for 43 years,

Do you agree that means he would have quit

A

Q

A okay.

Q    What question are you answering, sir?

A    I'm finishing my answer.

Q    Let's start at line 2 and read through line 18 together.

During his deposition was Mr. Shulman asked these questions and did he give these answers:

Thereupon,

the following proceedings continued from Volume 43 at 5:11

p.m.:

P-R-O-C-E-E-D-I-N-G-S THE BAILIFF:  Come to order.  Court is back in session.

THE COURT:  All right.  I think he's okay. We're going to put him at the end just in case he needs to run back out again.  He's having stomach issues.  We're going to leave the jury room unlocked so he can run back there if he needs to.

Okay.  I think we're ready to bring them in.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, before the jury comes in, Mr. Furr, I guess, is anticipating using � THE BAILIFF:  Jury entering. (Thereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  Feeling a little bit better?  All right.  You're going to put him on the end there, okay. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. HAMMER:  He's going to use the deposition of Mr. Shulman in referencing the medical records.  However, as Dr. Seidman

Page 5901 testified, it's going � if you go all the way

to page 104, it's totally consistent with what

Dr. Seidman just testified to, that being that

it's said that when he was confronted -- when

Mr. Shulman was confronted with it in his

deposition, he said, that's not true.  Those

aren't inaccurate.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. HAMMER:  Which is exactly what Dr. Seidman just testified to.

So -- you know, so when Dr. Seidman said, I relied on the depo, he didn't just rely on one line.  He relied on the entire depo.  You've got to take it in context.  That's the problem with going to one page of the depo and using it with the witness.

THE COURT:  Generally speaking, that's something that you would handle on redirect. You would point out that in other places he said this.  You would point out that -- so I don't think that's really a legal objection.

In other words, again, I've said this before several times, I think on both sides, no matter which side I've ruled in favor that there's such a thing as improper impeachment,

Page 5902 and there's such a thing as good impeachment and

bad impeachment.  Maybe it's bad impeachment

because the record says otherwise.

MR. HAMMER:  That's why �

THE COURT:  Generally speaking I allow impeachment even if it's bad impeachment.

MR. HAMMER:  This isn't impeachment because it's not Dr. Seidman's testimony.

THE COURT:  I guess it wouldn't be technically impeachment.  It's challenging the conclusion �

MR. HAMMER:  That's why I'm saying �

THE COURT:  � based on whatever he reviewed.

MR. HAMMER:  My objection is not improper impeachment.  It's improper use of the deposition because it's not using the deposition in a complete way.  Because we're talking about page 101, but he explains it -- Mr. Shulman explains it at page 104.  So if he's going to do that, we would ask for rule of completeness to jump to this page as well which covers it. That's �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, these depositions are 900 pages long.  You can't include all of

Y.  Somewhere else it might say Z.  They can do

that.  I can't be hamstrung.

THE COURT:  Yeah, that's really redirect.

Let's just go on.

MR. FURR:  Continue, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  You may proceed.

CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  We were talking about what

Mr. Shulman said with respect to the pre-anesthesia

medical record that he filled out showing in his own

handwriting that indicated, if we did the math, that

he quit in 1975.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  And a little while ago, I just

looked at the transcript, you testified that when

Mr. Shulman was shown that record, and he said he

threw that out because he didn't want to be talking

about that, right ?

A    That's what I just said.

Q    That's what you just said, but you have his

deposition up there, right?  We handed it to you

Q   Were you looking at page 101? A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  In the deposition that you reviewed and relied upon, isn't it true that Mr. Shulman testified as follows?

Question:  Do you recall before you went in for the surgery on your bladder you were given what they call anesthesia or anesthetics before the surgery?  Do you remember that?

Answer:  I don't.  They must have, but �

Question:  And your bladder surgery was a major surgery?

Answer:  Oh, yeah.

And do you recall talking to your doctors in advance of that surgery?

Answer:  Oh, yes.

Question:  You knew at the time that it was important to be truthful with your doctors when you were talking to them before this major surgery was conducted, right.

The answer was:  Yes.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

completeness right now?

already --

MR. FURR:  You just ruled on that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right.

the Cleveland Clinic of Florida, right?

	So, again, subtracting 30 from 2003, that

It says:  One, one and a half, more than one.  A lot of days I had � I smoked one pack a day. In the beginning I couldn't get cigarettes.  I would get whatever I could borrow or something.  It was less than one.  But most of the time it was one or more, one and a quarter, one and a half packs, sometimes it varied.  I guess when I filled this out, you know, got through it as quick as I could.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

A    He's talking about how it progressed in his life, that when he was a kid and he didn't have money, he could only get what he could get.  Then he had one pack, one and a half, and then it got up to two later in his life.  So he's talking about how it changed over the course of his life.  That's what

Q    You're going to tell us what he is trying

to say?

A    That is what he is saying. Q    Did I just read that question and answer correctly?

A    Yeah.  That's what he's saying. Q    Nowhere in that question does he say two packs a day, does he?

A    Not in this section. Q    Okay.

A    In other places he does.  You're picking and choosing.

Q    That's an interesting point that you bring up that we're going to look at more closely.

There are inconsistencies in the factual record that you reviewed on any number of issues, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Overbroad, Judge.  I object.  He's got to be more specific. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  His story is pretty consistent.  He says that he smoked a pack when he was 21, then it went up to 25 to 30, then it went to two packs.  And then it went past two

Q    Sir, as you analyzed this record and prepared to testify, you saw inconsistencies on a number of the issues that you testified on before this jury, didn't you?

A    That's not an inconsistency.  It's a developmental disease.  Nicotine dependence is a developmental disease.  It starts off with a few, and it goes up higher and higher.  That's one of the characteristics of the disease.  That's not an inconsistency.

Q    I'm not asking you about this specific issue now.

A    That's my answer.

Q    I said, on a variety of issues that you testified about in front of this jury you saw inconsistencies in the record?

A    What other?  What are you talking about?

Q    Well, we'll look at it.  We'll look at it. You told this jury that Mr. Shulman smoked in bed on a weekly basis, didn't you?

A    That's what I read in the CME, that's what it says, that he smoked more than once a week in bed.

deposition Mr. Shulman testified that he never smoked

in bed?

Q    Isn't that what he testified to in his deposition?

A    It may be there.  It may be there.

Q    Let me ask you first to confirm for us that that is a transcript of Volume 8 of Mr. Shulman's deposition.

A    Yes, it is.

Q    Let me ask you to turn to page 564, lines 2 through 5.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  What volume, 8? MR. FURR:  8, the one I just handed you. BY MR. FURR:

Q    In Mr. Shulman's sworn testimony, isn't it true that he was asked these questions and gave these answers?

Question:  Did you smoke it in the bed?

Answer:  No.

Did you ever smoke in the bed?

Answer:  No.

Question:  Was that something that Mrs. Shulman prohibited you from doing?

Answer:  No.

Question:  Why did you then not smoke in the bed?

Answer:  Because I didn't think it was safe.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  And for rule of completeness, page 565, lines 17 through 20, please.

MR. FURR:  17 through what, 2 0?

Q    Are you there, Doctor?

A    I am.

Q    Question:  So you never smoked in bed throughout your life?

Answer:  I wouldn't say that.  I've tried not to.

Did we read all of those questions and answers correctly?

A    That's correct.

Q    Now, when you testified and told the jury that Mr. Shulman smoked in bed, you did not tell the jury that there was inconsistent testimony and that his sworn testimony in his deposition was that he did not smoke in bed, did you?

A    I don't consider that inconsistent. There's a 40-year smoking period, and different things happen at different times.  You know, sometimes when he had a young kid there, he might not have done it.  Later he might have been more out of control with it, and he did it.  So both stories can be true.  They're not inconsistent.

Q    Sir, we just read a question and answer where he was asked, Did you ever smoke in the bed, and his answer was, No, correct?

A    He says right after that that he wouldn't

Q    My point is this.  You came in here and told this jury that he smoked in bed, as though that were the sole story contained in this record, and did not tell the jury that there were inconsistent answers by Mr. Shulman at different times, did you? MR. SCHLESINGER:  Before you answer, I

object, Your Honor.  Argumentative. MR. FURR:  I'll rephrase it. THE COURT:  All right.  Please rephrase. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Did you tell this jury that there are inconsistent answers by Mr. Shulman as to whether or not he smoked in bed?

A    I don't consider it inconsistent.  I don't say that he smoked in bed for 40 years.  There were periods of time where he smoked in bed, which is what I read.  I don't know exactly when it was, but he was very clear about it, more than once a week.

And the person interviewing him said, I'm surprised at that because you're a careful guy.  And he said, You don't understand my addiction.  I intended not to smoke in bed, but I did it anyway.  I intended not to, but I did it anyway.

A    No.  They're different periods of time. This is a 40 year at minimum, it might be 60 years, it was at least 40 years of smoking, different things happened.  It's a developmental disease.  It progresses.  That's what addiction is.

Q    Did you try to tell the jury the full story, or did you cherry pick the facts that supported the story that you wanted to tell?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Before you answer, Doctor, I know it is getting late and I don't want tempers flaring, but, Judge, that's argumentative, I object.

MR. FURR:  It's a fair question. THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the objection.  I have an emergency call coming in. I may have to take that.  Let's do a quick ten-minute recess.

THE BAILIFF:  Court is in recess. (Whereupon, a recess was taken at 5:31 p.m.)

THE COURT:  As soon as the lawyers are back in, let's bring them back in. THE BAILIFF:  All right.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let's go ahead. (Thereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom.)

Page 5917 THE COURT:  Thank you.  Have a seat.

My apologies for the interruption.  You may

proceed.

MR. FURR:  Thank you. BY MR. FURR:

Q    All right, Doctor, I want to explore another topic with you, and that's your testimony about Mr. Shulman choosing not to work at a gas station because he was a smoker, right?

A    Yes.

Q    That's what you told the jury, right?

A    Yes.

Q    You told the jury that that demonstrated to you that his smoking was interfering with him, right?

A    That was one example of things that interfered with his work.

Q    But you did not tell this jury that, in fact, Mr. Shulman worked at his father-in-law's gas station for three years in the early 1940s, did you?

A   Well, he could work at that one and go take smoking breaks.  At the first one they wouldn't let him smoke there.  That's why he didn't take a job in the Depression, because he was afraid it was unsafe, because he couldn't smoke there.  There's a difference.  They're not the same.  When he was

campus and take a smoke.

Q    You did not tell the jury that Mr. Shulman

worked for his father-in-law at a gas station for

three years and that he pumped gas while he worked

there, did you?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  Asked and

answered, Your Honor.

MR. FURR:  It's a different question.

THE WITNESS:  Well, the same thing.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Go ahead, you can answer.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.  It's the same thing.

He was � in one job he could take because he

could go off and smoke and one he couldn't take

because he was around gas and he wasn't able to

smoke.  He wasn't going to do it.  This was when

he was younger in the '30s.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    You put up a demonstrative listing a

whole � listing a number of withdrawal symptoms that

you said Mr. Shulman experienced when he quit

smoking, right?

A    Yes.

Page   5919 Mrs.   Shulman,   didn't  you?

A         Yes,    I   did.

Q    You know that Mrs. Shulman reported that she did not notice any withdrawal symptoms when Mr. Shulman quit smoking, right?

A    Well, she said a lot of different things at different times because she got very confused in the testimony, that's I remember about that testimony. She's getting older and she gets very confused.

Q    You know that she reported that she did not notice any withdrawal symptoms when Mr. Shulman quit smoking, right?

A    Part of it was that she weren't around. This guy worked 18 hours a day, and he wasn't around most of the time.  She said she was asleep when he came home.  His quit attempts didn't even last a day. So it's -- you know, in my mind that was the situation.

Q    I'm not talking about the quit attempts. I'm talking about when he quit smoking permanently at a time when he retired.

A    Do you mean in 1989?

Q    I haven't finished yet.  You saw earlier that he quit before he retired � excuse me, after he retired.  When he quit smoking permanently when he

notice any withdrawal signs, did she?

A    Well, they said that he quit in the mid to late '80s, that's what they said.  It's completely different than the medical records.  So are you talking about when he quit, when they said, both of them, that he quit in the mid to late '80s, that's what they said �

Q    I'm talking about when he quit permanently.

A    When did he quit permanently?  You tell me.

Q    I'm not a fact witness in the case.  These are the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that will determine issues like that.

A    Some of the records say '75.  He says mid to late '80s.

Q    Excuse me.  Do you remember the question I'm asking you?

A    I'm trying to figure out which quit you're talking about, when it was?

Q    Whenever it was when he quit permanently, Mrs. Shulman did not notice any withdrawal symptoms, did she?

A    You'd have to show me, I'm sorry.

Honor?

Volume 1 of Mrs. Shulman's testimony, correct, taken

June 12, 2014; is that correct?

do 9 through 15.

Question:  And did you notice anything

different about Mr. Shulman after he quit

permanently ?

Answer:  No.

Yes.  He smelied better.

And aside from not smelling like cigarette

smoke, did you notice anything different about your

husband when he quit smoking permanently?

Answer:  No.

Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A    You did.

that Mr. Shulman's smoking impaired his relationship

with his family members, didn't you?

A    Yeah, I didn't have any question about that.

Q    You did not tell the jury that Harvey Shulman testified that his relationship with his father was not diminished by his smoking, did you?

A    In his depo -- they all loved their father. They hated the cigarettes and the addiction and it caused problems for them, but they loved their father.

Q    Right.  I'm talking about what you reviewed before you told this jury that Mr. Shulman's smoking impaired his relationship with his family members?

A    It did impair it.  She hated it.  It was throughout the courtship and the whole marriage she hated his smoking.

Q    Do you remember what we're talking about? We're talking about Harvey now.

A    Harvey said he came to visit him and had to leave in ten minutes because he was so agitated looking for a smoke.  It was very disappointing to Harvey.  It didn't mean that he didn't love him.  He did love him.

Page 5924 Q    Didn't Harvey testify that his relationship

with his father was not diminished by this issue?

A    He loved his father, if that's what you're asking.

Q    I'm asking what I asked.  Didn't he testify that way?

A    He said that he was disappointed that his father had to leave so quickly because he was so agitated and anxious and craving the cigarillos. That's when the cigarette got in the way of their relationship.

MR. FURR:  Could I have Harvey Shulman's

deposition that includes page 100?

BY MR. FURR:

Q    The question preceding Harvey's testimony that it did not in any way diminish his relationship with his father was this question and answer:

Question:  We talked earlier about the � I think you described them as passionate discussions you would have with your father about quitting smoking?

Answer:  Yes.

Question:  Did that in any way diminish your relationship with your father? Answer:  No.

Did I read that correctly? A    He's talking about the fact that they had --

Q    Sir, the question is, did I read it correctly?

A    You read it correctly.  He's talking about how --

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I move to strike. This is not responsive.

THE COURT:  The witness should wait for the next question.

Question:  Was that a point of contention

between the two of you in the 1970s and '80s on?

Page 592� Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A    I believe so.

Q    Now, you also testified that Mr. Shulman's smoking was a source of contention and conflict throughout what's been a 73-year marriage, right?

A    That sounds like what I might have said. Q    But, in fact, it was a minor issue between them, wasn't it?

A    That's your opinion, isn't it?

Q    Don't you agree?

A    No, I do not agree it was a minor opinion. People hate secondhand smoke, passive smoke.  She couldn't breathe.  Her eyes hurt.  She hated the way it smelled.  She had a strong reaction to it and she was very vocal about it, and it was a problem throughout their whole relationship.  Did they get divorced because of it?  No.  But -- she loved him, but it was uncomfortable for her the whole time.

Q    All right.  Let's try to pin this down. Obviously they did not get divorced over it, right ?

A    No, they didn't get divorced.  They loved each other very much.

Q    They didn't seek marital counseling either,

A    Not that I know of.

Q    In fact, during that medical examination that you've referred to several times, Mr. Shulman testified that these arguments that they would have about smoking would affect their relationship for between two and five minutes, right?

A    I don't remember that.  It may be there, but I think it was a very serious conflict and problem.  That's my opinion.

MR. FURR:  Do we have that transcript? You know what, never mind.  It's not worth

doing.  I'll go on. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, isn't it true that the Shulmans never had to make up with each other after they had one of these discussions about smoking, they just went on with their daily business and everything was fine?

A    He said she screamed at him.  She put up signs in the house on the refrigerator.  It was a frequent thing.  And also he felt very guilty and he felt very bad about it.

And I know about this because I treat people who are letting their families down around smoking and they feel very guilty and they feel

And he had a big problem with this

throughout the marriage, and she had a big problem

with it.  That's my opinion.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman

testified that they never had to come back and make

up with each other after these discussions about

smoking?

A    They loved each other.  It wasn't a deal

breaker, but it was a source of a great deal of

unhappiness for her, and it was an ongoing conflict

for the whole time that he smoked --

up with each other after those discussions about his

smoking, did they?

about his smoking, would you then just go your

with his smoking?

correctly?

A    Yes.

rule of completeness?

MR. FURR:  Lines 5 through what?

A    At least part of it.

Q    Nothing about his smoking prevented him from doing any of those things, did it?

A    Well, when he got sick with bladder cancer, everything that he did that he enjoyed was taken away from him.  All of the activities that he enjoyed he could no longer do, boating, flying planes, riding bikes.  He was an extremely active, strong guy.  All that was gone as soon as he had that bladder cancer. That changed his life and his life was never the same after that.

Page 5938 Q    Do you remember the question I asked you?

A    That was the answer that I gave you.

Q    My question was nothing about his smoking. Would what you've described as his preoccupation with smoking have prevented him from leading a productive life and accomplishing all those things we've just talked about, did it?

A   Well, he was edgy and anxious all the time. So did he feel good?  Did it cost him something? Yeah, it cost him a lot.  Did he manage despite the smoking to be successful?  Sure.  It's the same thing as with the marriage.  He had a loving wife.  He had a good marriage, but the smoking is one of the things that made it a lot less good than it would have been.

Q    Yesterday Mr. Schlesinger asked � do you remember you had a conversation with Mr. Schlesinger about Karl Fagerstrom?

A    I'm sure that name came up.

Q    In fact, yesterday Mr. Schlesinger asked you whether in recent years Karl Fagerstrom had sold his nicotine gum company to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, right?

A    Yeah.

Q    You said, I've heard this.  It's a little disheartening to me personally, but I've read that,

A    That sounds like something I would say about it.  I am disappointed in Dr. Fagerstrom.

Q    Well, we're going to explore this a little bit.

Karl Fagerstrom, Dr. Fagerstrom is the researcher who developed the Fagerstrom test that you applied in this case, correct?

A

One of the tests I applied in this case,

yes

Q    One of the tests, right?

A    Right.  That's what he's most famous for.

Q    And in Sweden he developed a nicotine replacement therapy that could be used to help smokers stop smoking, correct?

A    I don't know that much about the details of what he's doing business wise.  I know he got $40 million or something like that from your company. That's all I know.

Q    You know that R.J. Reynolds paid Dr. Fagerstrom $40 million to buy a company called Niconovum that manufactures nicotine replacement products that are used to help smokers quitting prevent s, right ?

A    I don't know that much about his product

know that.  I don't have a lot of details about it.

So I'm really not in a position to talk about it.

Q    Try to track my question here.

You testified yesterday that you were disappointed that Dr. Fagerstrom sold his company to R.J. Reynolds, right ?

A    Yeah, that disappoints me.

Q    You know that R.J. Reynolds paid $40 million for that company, right?

A    Yes.

Q    And you know that what that company did was manufacture nicotine replacement products to be used to help smokers stop smoking, correct?

A    I don't know anything about the product. I'm not in a position to talk about the product itself.  I would have to research it.

Q    Sir, yesterday Mr. Schlesinger asked you in recent years did he actually sell his nicotine gum company to the R.J. Reynolds company to R.J. Reynolds and you said I've heard this, right?

A    I have heard this, but I don't know that much about it.  I don't like to talk about things I don't understand.  I don't have that much detail about it.  I'm disappointed that he would be in

Q    Do you know it was a nicotine gum company,

right ?

A    I don't know what you're going to do with it.  I don't know that much about the product.  I would need to know a lot more about it.

Q    You told Mr. Schlesinger that you knew that it was a nicotine gum company, right?

A    No, I didn't say that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I have to object Judge.

Q    Yesterday Mr. Schlesinger asked you in recent years did he actually sell his nicotine gum company to the R.J. Reynolds company to R.J. Reynolds and you said I've heard this, right?

A    I've heard this.  I don't know what you're going to do with it.  I don't know enough about the situation.  That's what I've heard.  That's about the sum total of what I've heard.

the nicotine gum company, right?

A    I don't know what they're going to do with it.  They could kill it.  I don't know what they're going to do with it.

Q    Don't you know that R.J. Reynolds has already gotten FDA approval to sell nicotine gum in the United States under a brand name called Zonnic to help smokers quit smoking?

A    Well, there's a lot of other things you're doing that are making my job harder �

Q    Sir, please track my question.

A    I don't know that much about the details. I've already told you that.

Q    You are � as you have told us, you are an expert on smoking cessation, right?

A    Yes.

Q    And you've told us that you are a proponent of carefully titrating the nicotine replacement medications that you use to help smokers quit, right?

A    That's true.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, objection.  I ask to approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I object to the current state of what they're doing because there is a whole debate now where or if they're distributing this gum as of current times.

THE COURT:  The question is whether this witness has any familiarity.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He doesn't.

THE COURT:  You'd have to, I guess, ask him if he knows anything about it.

MR. FURR:  Here is the question and response that he gave to Mr. Schlesinger at the bottom of the page.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right.  But you just asked him ten times, and he doesn't know what the use of the product is.  I was prohibited yesterday from going into the current effects of smoking.  This witness wanted to say that his job is getting harder so it's more addictive than ever, and Your Honor said it wasn't relevant.

MR. GDANSKI:  Also, with Dr. Proctor, every

Page 5944 time the word "today" or "current" or "right

now" or "in this day," you prohibited every one

of those questions.

Now Mr. Furr is asking about Reynolds making application and receiving permission from the FDA to sell Niconovum gum?  I had a whole line of questions about Reynolds blocking me --one second, Scott.  I had whole line of questions about Reynolds blocking the FDA, Reynolds objecting to the FDA.

Regulation is something Your Honor didn't permit at all, suing the FDA.  They've just let a huge cat out of the bag we would obviously need to put on rebuttal evidence for.

MR. FURR:  I would never introduce this, add an issue by myself.  Mr. Schlesinger put that issue -- why he chose to have this witness say that Reynolds bought this and he disapproves of it, I don't know, but surely I am entitled to probe what he knows about it.

THE COURT:  Make the objections, but you need to find out if this witness even knows anything more about it.

MR. GDANSKI:  He just said 10 times he doesn't.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Proceed. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, as a smoking cessation expert who advocates the use of nicotine replacement products, are you aware that R.J. Reynolds is making and marketing Zonnic, a nicotine-replacement product nationwide in convenience stores across this country?

A    No, I'm not aware of it.

Q    Your sworn testimony is you don't know anything about that?

A    I don't.

Q    Okay.  Well, let me ask you this question then.  If R.J. Reynolds is making and marketing a nicotine replacement in convenience stores across this country and making them available to help smokers quit at a price that is cheaper �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.  Excuse me. THE COURT:  Let him finish the question. BY MR. FURR:

Q    � at a price that is cheaper than Nicorette gum, isn't that a responsible thing to do?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm assuming he gave you the one that deals with the motion on responsibility.

THE COURT:  Which paragraph?

MR. FURR:  While they're identifying the paragraph, the pretrial ruling has to do with precluding plaintiffs from criticizing R.J. Reynolds or other defendants for failing to take responsibility in this case with respect to Mr. Shulman's injuries.

THE COURT:  So I don't know how this has anything to do with that.

MR. GDANSKI:  So asking about everything outside of the courtroom, whether that is examples of them behaving responsible or irresponsible is fair game?

in stopping smoking and that that product is being

packages that contain fewer number of doses to make

the product even more available and less costly than

other nicotine-replacement products on the market.

Would you agree that that would be a

responsible thing for R.J. Reynolds to do to help

smokers stop smoking?

A    R.J. Reynolds has been a force behind the

epidemic of death and disease �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me. Your Honor;

MR. GDANSKI:  He's just explaining.

THE COURT:  Could the witness answer the

question that's been posed to the witness?

MR. GDANSKI:  We are.

THE WITNESS:  It's not responsible in any

way because at the same that they're doing that;

Page 5953 Q    Sir, you testified on multiple occasions

that Mr. Shulman only continued smoking cigarettes

because he was trying to prevent withdrawal symptoms

from stopping smoking, right?

A    That was a large part of it, to get the nicotine that he needed.

Q    In fact, Mrs. Shulman testified that Mr. Shulman liked smoking, right?

A    She may have said that at one place and said something else.  She was very confused when she gave her deposition.

Question:  Fair to say that based on your

knowledge of your husband at some point in time when

he was a cigarette smoker he liked to smoke

cigarettes?

Answer:  Yes.

Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A    Yes.  At some point in time, not clear what

point in time that indicates.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Counsel, rule of

Would you say that he still liked smoking?

Answer:  Yes.  He was addicted to it.  He didn't like smoking.

Question:  Based on your knowledge of your husband and your position earlier that he did like smoking, I need to clarify whether you think he still liked smoking when you were living in Winthrop?

Answer:  He did.

Question:  He did?

Answer:  He liked smoking.

Question:  Now �

He had to smoke.  He was addicted to it. He could not leave them alone.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let this reflect that that was the answer starting at line 20. Counsel said question.  That was an answer. Could you clarify that? BY MR. FURR:

Q    Yes.  The question was:  Now �

And the answer at line 20 was:  He had to smoke.  He was addicted to it.  He could not leave them alone.

Page 5957 I know you told me I read them correctly

before.  I'll ask you did, again, I read those

questions and answers correctly?

A    Yeah.

Q    Now, Mr. Shulman himself testified in his deposition that he liked to smoke while watching television, right?

A    It's possible.  The point is that people like to smoke when they're addicted because it gets rid of the bad feelings that they're getting from the depletion of the nicotine.  So it feels good to get rid of something bad.  That's what happens with smokers.

MR. FURR:  May I have Volume 8 of Mr. Shulman's deposition, please? May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. FURR:  In an effort to try to move this along, it's almost 7:00, I will hand you another copy. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Let me ask you to confirm first that I have handed you Volume 8 of Mr. Shulman's deposition taken August 29th � A    Yes.

Answer:  Yes.

Could you please tell me what you mean by, I like to do it or I had to do it or I did it?  I don't understand.  My brain doesn't separate these things.  What do you mean by the question, did I like to do it?

Question:  You don't understand that question?

Question:  You don't know what the word "like" means.

Q    Sir, isn't it also true that Mr. Shulman testified that he smoked to relieve frustration?

A    The frustration of being addicted.

MR. FURR:  Could I have the CME � you know

what, it's too late.

Q    Sir, we talked about the social context of smoking, Mr. Shulman smoked with friends and co-workers while he lived in Boston, right?

A    I don't remember too much about that, but if you say so.

Q    Okay.  Now, I want to turn to a different topic, and that's Mr. Shulman's quit attempts because you testified at length about what you described as Mr. Shulman's numerous quit attempts, right?

A    He said that he tried dozens of times.

Q    Isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman testified that she has no recollection of Mr. Shulman ever making a quit attempt prior to his final quit?

A    No, that's not what she did -- you're really picking and choosing that one because she said

Answer:  He got very edgy and upset.  He would leave the house and smoke outside on the porch.

I did read those questions and answers correctly?

A    Yes.

Q    When did the Shulmans live in Winthrop?

A    I don't remember the timeline of when they were there.

Q    Based on the last two questions and answers that we've looked at, when I asked you about the rule of completeness that they asked me to read to you, isn't it fair to say that Mrs. Shulman testified inconsistently in her deposition about whether Mr. Shulman ever tried to quit?

A    I think she was confused.  That was my --in that one � I know one of the depositions they were asking her so many questions repeatedly that she got confused and they had to stop the deposition, and I don't know which one that was.  She was confused. She's getting old.  She is old.  And she was saying, yes, he quit and then she was saying different things at different times.

Q    Was Mrs. Shulman confused whenever she gave answers inconsistent with what you want to testify

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.

Argumentative, Judge.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Also, can we finish the

rule of completeness?  The part we gave you to

read, you didn't finish.

MR. FURR:  What else do you want me to

read?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's all highlighted.

MR. GDANSKI:  To the redline on page 18.

Q    Question:  Tell me what you remember about

Mr. Shulman trying not to smoke � and we'11 talk

about the other stuff a little bit later, okay.  But

right now my question is, what can you tell me about

Mr. Shulman trying to quit smoking when you were

living in Winthrop?

Page 5966 Question:  Yes, ma'am.

When you were living in Winthrop, what can you tell me about what Mr. Shulman did to try to quit smoking?

Answer:  He tried to stop, but he couldn't.

Question:  And what do you remember about Mr. Shulman trying to stop?

Answer:  Because I thought it was unhealthy.

I understood that,, and you told your husband that, right?

Answer:  Yes.

Question:  But what do you remember about what Mr. Shulman did to try to quit smoking?

Answer:  He tried to chew gum.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

A    Yes.

Q   In that passage that counsel just asked me to read, Mrs. Shulman testified that Mr. Shulman tried to quit smoking because she told him that his smoking was unhealthy for him, right?  Lines 8 through 14 that we just read.

THE COURT:  Are you on page 15 6?

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  8 to 13?

THE WITNESS:  8 to 13.

MR. FURR:  8 to 14, Your Honor, thank you.

THE WITNESS:  Remember � what else do you

remember about Mr. Shulman trying to stop?

Because I thought it was unhealthy.  That's what

she says, yes.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    8 through 14, you've read that?

A    Yeah.

Q    She testified that Mr. Shulman tried to

stop smoking because she thought it was unhealthy and

that she told Mr. Shulman it was unhealthy, right?

A    That's what she says there.

Q    And this is when they were living in

Winthrop, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, later in that answer she said that

what she remembered about him trying to quit was that

he tried to chew gum, right?

A    Right, in this passage it's what she's

saying.

Page 5968 Q    You know, based on the timing of this that

the gum she was referring to was just regular chewing

gum, right?

A    Did you say the year?  I'm sorry, I don't have that timeline.

Q    When they lived in Winthrop?

A    I don't know what year that was. Q    You don't know that?

A    No, I do not.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I know the Court indicated you wanted to go to 7:00, but the jury looks really tired to me.  My knees are killing me.  Under no condition are we going to finish this witness today.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No objection.

THE COURT: I'm sorry that your knees are killing you. This jury, as tired as you think they look, they have volunteered to stay until 8:00, if we can get this witness done tonight.

They're obviously concerned about the fact that this thing is dragging on and dragging on,

Page 5969 they would rather stay.  So I mean, I'd let you

sit down and question him if you need to sit

down and explain to the jury that you've got a

knee issue.

MR. FURR:  No, I'm fine.

THE COURT:  I think I'd rather keep going if we can.  Do you guys think we can get through this witness if we have until 8:00?

MR. FURR:  I do not.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They've got redirect.

THE COURT:  Let's keep going.  We can start at Thursday 9:00 a.m.  Because I don't have --I -- originally I was going to be out of town, as I recall, I canceled my plans because of this trial.  And so I had not scheduled 8:45.  So unless somebody staggers in thinking that I have 8:45s, I shouldn't have any.  So I'm thinking we can start at � I have an 8:30 to 9:00.  We can start at 9:00.

But I have an evening event to go to so I can only go to about 4:00 on Thursday, so we'll go from 9:00 to 4:00.  I'll take a short lunch break on Thursday.  So I just want to get as much as we can possibly get done right now.  The jury seems to be okay with staying.  The deputy

actually.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, two things.  One, and we can do it again once the jury is gone, we need to make a motion for a mistrial based on Dr. Seidman's objecting to statements about the 2014 Surgeon General's report.

THE COURT:  I struck it right away.  And you guys were questioning him, and it was in response to questions from at least your co-defendant.  And these are risks based on questions you ask sometimes as to what they're going to blurt out.

But I immediately struck it.  I instructed the jury to disregard it.  If you want me to give the jury a specific instruction that you'd like me to tailor that addresses the Surgeon General's report directly, I'm more than happy to do so.

MR. BRENNER:  We made it � at this point, however, you are denying the motion for mistrial?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BRENNER:  The second thing, I'll say this as I said before, Your Honor, I know you

Page 5971 said the jury wants to stay, my observation is

that there's not a jury or anyone that can sit

through 14 hours a day and have the same level

of attention.  I'd say the same thing if they

were doing it.

THE COURT:  They had a very long lunch break.  They had a long break.  And I would not keep them past 7:00 except for the fact that they volunteered to do so.  You know, they know it's not � you guys are not requesting it. They know it's their desire.

MR. BRENNER:  I'd reiterate my request, it's not appropriate to have cross-examinations of key witnesses in the case going to 8:00 at night, whether the jury says -- they want to stay, Your Honor, because we told them the trial was going to be over.  Because you were told by counsel when this trial would be over, and we're now past the end of the trial.  They haven't rested their case yet.

THE COURT:  I understand that, but I've got to get done with this thing because you guys are not the only case I have.  You're only one of 14-, 1,500 cases.

MR. BRENNER:  I get that, Your Honor.

Page 5972 THE COURT:  So I've got to get done with

this thing.  All right.  Let's go. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. FURR:

Q    All right.  I'm going to continue talking about Mr. Shulman's attempts to quit smoking, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    I want to go back to � we talked on direct examination about his smoking in high school, so I want to just talk about a few things there.  Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman testified that there was no smoking allowed in the school yard at his school?

A    Yeah.  They came out and they told him to stop, and they punished him if they found him.

Q    Isn't it true that he testified that he got � to your point, he got punished for smoking in school, right?

A    Yeah, for smoking in the basement, bathroom, or something like that, they told his parents.

Q    A hall monitor found him smoking, right?

A    Yes.

Q    The hall monitor told Mr. Shulman that he shouldn't be smoking in school, right?

A    He knew that.

right ?
	
	

A
	Yeah.
	

Q
	And the hall monitor took his cigarettes
	
away, right?
		

A
	Very possibly.
	

Q
	And crushed them, right?
	

A
	I don't remember that detail,

he wasn'

punished for it, he told the authorities at school
		
that he

would not smoke anymore, right?

two months, he said he was smoking every day, which

happens to youngsters, teens, it happens for about

20, 25 percent of them pretty quickly.

Q    Sir, I'm asking you about Mr. Shulman.  The hour is late.  Try to track my question.  Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman told the school authorities that he wouldn't smoke anymore?

A    It's very possible.  I don't remember that detail either.  I'm sorry.

Q    Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman was smoking within an hour after he left the school?

A    He was addicted, and he was always smoking.

Q    So is that a yes?

A    It is.  I don't remember every one of these details, but they sound right.

Q    Mr. Shulman was punished many times for smoking in school, right?

A    I don't know how many, but it was an issue. That's why he went to the family doctor for help because he didn't know what to do.

Q    His testimony is that he was punished many times, right?

A    That's possible, yes.

Q    Okay.  Now, with respect to the family

Page 5975 doctors, Mr. Shulman testified that sometime before

1940 he asked Dr. Coy for his advice in helping quit

smoking, right?

A    He did do that.

Q    So at that point before 1940, Mr. Shulman had formed a belief that he needed medical assistance to quit smoking, right?

A He was looking for help and he asked the doctor, and the doctor said, I don't know anything about it.

Q    So is the answer to my question right?

A    He was looking -- he was looking for help and he asked the doctor.  I don't know what was in his mind.  He was looking for help.

Q    Well, he asked the doctor for help quitting smoking because he believed he needed medical assistance, right?

A    That's what you're saying.  He was hoping the doctor could help him.  The doctor said, I don't know anything about this.  I don't know how to help you.

Q    And after that one instance before 1940, isn't it true that Mr. Shulman never approached any other doctor for help in quitting smoking?

A    Yeah, I think he didn't -- I don't know if

By the way, that's what most people do.

Most people do not go to the doctor.

Q    Excuse me, sir, I'm only asking you about Mr. Shulman.

A    But it's wrong --

Q    It's ten to 7:00.  We're going to try to get done today.  I'm only asking you about Mr. Shulman.

A    I'm just trying to provide a little context.

Q    I want to track, if we can, chronologically a little bit so we have some context about when Mr. Shulman tried to quit and what he tried to do, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    Do you remember when Mr. Shulman worked at a place called First Service Command between 1944 and 1955?  He testified about his work on the lathe, right ?

A    Right.  He was working on precision equipment.

Q    During that timeframe, when Mr. Shulman was being reprimanded for smoking at work, he once

Page 5977 deliberately left his cigarettes at work � excuse

me, at home so he wouldn't smoke at work, right?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember every detail of the record, it's 1,000 pages.

Q    You don't remember that ?

A    I don't remember � yeah, actually, it does ring a bell that he tried to do that.

Q    But then the first thing he did when he got to work was he borrowed cigarettes from another employee, right ?

A    Sounds like an addict to me.

Q    So is the answer to my question correct?

A    That sounds correct to me.

Q    In fact, he said, after he left the cigarettes at home, that he borrowed cigarettes from another smoker about 12 to 15 minutes after he left home, right ?

A    Yeah, that sounds like an addict.

Q    Now, you said on your direct examination that Mr. Shulman smoked a pipe in an effort to quit smoking, right?

A    He was trying to switch it up to see if that would help him to quit the cigarettes.

Q    How long did he smoke a pipe for?

A    I don't remember the detail.

Page 5978 Q    About a day and a half, right?

A    He tried it.

Q    Is that your recollection?

A    He tried it.  It didn't work.  That was one of the many ineffective things he tried.

Q    Excuse me, sir.  Sir, my only question to you was, do you remember he only smoked a pipe for a day and a half?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember every detail of the record, and the hour is late.

Q    Do you accept that representation?

A    I believe that it could be true that that's all he could do with it.  He probably figured it wasn't working.  He probably needed the cigarette.

Q    Mr. Shulman, you testified on direct examination that Mr. Shulman also tried cigars to try to quit smoking, right?

A    It was the same strategy, same ineffective strategy, self-help strategy.

Q    In fact, he didn't even smoke a single cigar because he thought it was too strong, right?

A    That's very possible.

Q    Now, I want to go to the Dave Frank's Automobile Store that we talked about earlier, the place where Mr. Shulman worked pumping gas for his

Page 5979 father-in-law.  Do you remember that?

A    I do.

Q    What years did he work there?

A    I can't remember the whole timeline.

Q    Does 1945 to 1948 sound correct to you?

A    It's possible.

Q    Do you dispute that?

A    I'm not going to dispute that now.

Q    Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman does not remember, does not specifically recall a time when he tried to quit smoking during those years when he worked at Dave Frank's Auto?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember that detail.  I don't.  There's a lot of details.

Q    Let's go to Clean Bright.  That's the business that Mr. Shulman built up to thousands of employees and sold, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    You know that he owned and operated that business from the 1950s to the 1970s, right?

A    Sound right to me.

Q    Mr. Shulman remembers an instance where one morning he decided that he was not going to smoke anymore during those years, right?

A    Sounds familiar.

Page 5980 Q    And he threw his cigarettes in the dumpster

because he wanted to quit, right?

A    Sounds like out of frustration and he was trying to do it, and that's another ineffective technique that he used.

Q    He actually told us why he tried to quit. He said he wanted � he tried to quit mostly for his wife, right, because she was urging him to stop?

A    Well, I think he believed that he couldn't stop, and he also believed that they wouldn't sell it if it was dangerous.  He believed both of those things.

MR. FURR:  Can I have Volume 9 of

Mr. Shulman's deposition?

May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Doctor, let me ask you to take a look at that transcript and confirm for us that that is Volume 9 of Mr. Shulman's deposition that was taken November 12 � excuse me, November 10, 2014?

A    Yes, that's correct.

Q    And let me ask you to turn to page 633, lines 1 through 9.  Actually, you need to go to 632, line 22 through line 9 on the next page.

MR. FURR:  Yes.

BY MR. FURR:

Q   Are you there, sir?

A    I'm sorry, I have to go to the next page. Q    632, line 22.  Are you there? A    Yes.

Q   Isn't it true that he was asked these questions and gave these answers?

Question:  I want to explore a little bit more of your memories of that episode in which you stopped smoking for 14 to 15 hours.  So let me start with this question.  Can you explain to us what caused you to stop smoking at that time and not smoke for 14 or 15 hours?

Answer:  I think mostly my wife.  She urged me to stop smoking several times because my fingers would get yellow from the tobacco, and I tried to stop for her, but I couldn't.

Question:  Your wife has testified � That was objected to.  I'll stop there. Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

A    Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  You stopped at line 9?

trying to keep up.

MR. FURR:  That's what I read, through

line 9.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's fine.  Thank you.

That's fine.  Thank you. BY MR. FURR:

Q    That 14 to 15 hour time span was the longest time that Mr. Shulman ever remembered going smoke free until the time he finally stopped, right?

A    I believe that's correct, yes, that's how I remember it.

Q    As we discussed, Mr. Shulman owned that Clean Bright company for over 20 years from 1950s to the 1970s, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Mr. Shulman did not recall any other specific instance where he tried to quit smoking while he owned Clean Bright, correct?

A    I don't know what he was -- you know, what his efforts were.  I know that at some point he got frustrated and felt he couldn't do it and was -- felt that it wasn't possible for him, and so in that

during those years.

Q    Do you remember my question?

A    You asked me if there were any efforts made during those years.  I'm not really in a position to say that.  They may not be in the record.

Q    We looked at this a little earlier, let me have you confirm, that Mrs. Shulman testified that Mr. Shulman tried to quit smoking because she told him it was unhealthy, correct, that's what we looked at?

A    He said throughout the record he wanted to please her and he couldn't, that he intended to please her and he couldn't.

Q    And she told him it was unhealthy, correct?

A    In the early days, she meant that it was �

Q    Sir, I'm not asking you what she meant. I'm asking you what she told him.

A    I'm trying to answer.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a long question,

Judge.  I think the interruption wasn't well

taken.  The witness should be allowed to answer. THE COURT:  Overruled.

The question is, she told him that it was

A    It was unhealthy, yes.

Q    You mentioned an episode where Mr. Shulman stopped smoking one afternoon and then ultimately called his neighbor, the pharmacist, and asked him for a cigarette, right?

A    Yes.

Q    That was an episode where Mr. Shulman threw his cigarettes down the toilet, right?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember all of the details of it.  I remember that he couldn't stand it. It was about 10:00 at night, he called a man who owned a pharmacy to get him to open it because he was desperate for cigarettes.  That's what I remember about the incident.  I don't remember anything more than that.

Q    Do you remember he threw his cigarettes down the toilet around 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon?

A    I didn't remember that detail.

Q    And by 10:00 at night he was asking his neighbor to open up the pharmacy for cigarettes?

A   That sounds right, yes, sir.

Q    All right.  This is a demonstrative that you used on direct examination with Mr. Schlesinger, right ?

Q    You told this jury that Mr. Shulman used nicotine gum to try to quit, right?

A    I believe that's true.

Q    Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman testified under oath in his deposition that he never used nicotine gum to quit?

A    I don't know if he was confused because in the CME he talked about the actual --

Q    Do you remember my question?  I'm asking what he said in his deposition.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That was an inappropriate interruption, Your Honor.  He was explaining right on point.

MR. FURR:  He started talking about a different source, Your Honor.

Q    Focusing on his sworn deposition testimony in this case, are you with me? A    Yes.

Q    Isn't it true that in his sworn deposition testimony Mr. Shulman testified on more than one

because

	looks    I

like.  I
	don't know

they didn't have it

saying that he did i

	a        I

six-month period, so
		at some point, that gum
	didn't

come out

it.

Question:  Well, let me ask you about that, because as I understand it, from your prior testimony, you never tried nicotine gum?

His answer was:  That's correct. Did I read that question and answer correctly, sir?

nicotine gum, did you?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection.

Argumentative, Your Honor.

MR. FURR:  It's not argumentative, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I can't get over the idea

that he knew what the package looks like and he

described the product.  So I don't know how he

would know that if he didn't use the product.

He said he did in other places, so that's why

it's here. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Do you remember my question?

A    In this deposition he says one thing.  In the other exam he describes the gum.  So he must have used it because I don't know how anybody would know about that gum if they didn't use it.

Q    But instead of telling the jury that Mr. Shulman testified one way in his deposition and another way in his medical examination, you simply chose to rely upon the facts that help the plaintiff's case, right?

Page 5991 You also told the jury that in his efforts to try to

quit, Mr. Shulman used over-the-counter cessation

aids, correct?

A    I don't think I spoke about that.

Q    That's your slide, right, that's your demonstrative?

Didn't you agree on direct examination that Mr. Shulman used all these techniques to try to quit?

A    That's true.  I'm not -- I didn't make up this slide.  This is a slide that's made up by the lawyers?

Q    The lawyers make them up?

A    Yeah.

Q    But you agreed that Mr. Shulman used all these techniques to try to quit, right?

A    I'm not sure what's being referred to there is over-the-counter cessation aids.  Gum wouldn't have been over-the-counter until much later.

Q    He couldn't have used �

A    There was something that he used.  He used some kind of wooden -- they sell a lot of these kinds of substitute cigarettes and plastic cigarettes.  He used something that was marketed as an over-the-counter cessation aid that you picked up in a pharmacy.  That's what that refers to.

Page 5992 Q    Now you remember?

A    Now I remember.

Q    Okay.

A    I just remembered.

Q    Okay.  With respect to using nicotine gum over-the-counter, that couldn't have happened because that wasn't marketed over-the-counter until 1996, right ?

A    Well, it could have happened.  I'll tell you why, because I have patients who are on that gum for 15, 20 years after they quit smoking because they still don't feel right.  So that could have happened. I don't know if it did happen, but I know that that man knows what that gum looks like because he described it.

Q    Sir, my question for you was, over-the-counter nicotine gum was not available to the public until 1996, right?

A    That's correct.

Q    I'm going to try to get through this as quickly as we can, sir.  Wouldn't you agree that beginning in the 1930s, when Mr. Shulman was courting Mrs. Shulman, from that time on throughout their marriage she asked him on a regular basis to quit smoking?

she loved the man.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that when they were

dating � which would have been the years 1937 to

1941, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Wouldn't you agree that when they were dating, Mrs. Shulman was telling Mr. Shulman that his cigarette smoking was not good for him?

A    She didn't like what it did to his teeth or his nails, yeah, she didn't think it was good.  She didn't like being around it.  It made her eyes tear and made it hard for her to breathe.

Q    Isn't it true that when they were dating, Mrs. Shulman told Mr. Shulman that he was addicted to cigarettes in the 1930s?

A    Yeah, that he couldn't � he didn't believe he could stop already.

Q    Sir, on multiple occasions throughout their marriage Mrs. Shulman told Mr. Shulman that his smoking was not healthy for him and that he should quit, right?

A    She also says throughout the record that he never believed it was unhealthy.

Q    Sir, can you answer my question, not the

Q    Can you answer my question?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He's answering the

question, Your Honor, I object.

MR. FURR:  He's not answering my question. THE COURT:  The witness is directed to

answer the question that's been posed to him. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Isn't it true �

A What she meant by unhealthy in those days, yes, she said it was unhealthy.

Q After they got married, Mrs. Shulman continued to tell Mr. Shulman that smoking was unhealthy for him, right?

A    She said it throughout the marriage, and she hated the smoking, she hated the addiction, and she tried to break through to him.

Q    By telling him that smoking was unhealthy for him, right?

A    I'm sure she said a lot of different things about it.

Q    Including they're unhealthy for him?

Page 5995 A    Yeah, that's what we just said, isn't it?

Q    Let's just try to get this done, sir.

Sir, isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman

testifies that � on a deposition that she saw

articles about smoking being harmful in the 1950s and

1960s?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.

Outside the scope, what she saw.  Do we need to

approach?

MR. FURR:  If there's any confusion, I can

clear it up with this question.

THE COURT:  Do you want to withdraw it and

ask another question?

MR. FURR:  Sure.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman testified

that when she read articles in the newspaper

reporting that smoking was harmful, she shared that

information with Mr. Shulman?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor.

Still outside the scope of this witness'

testimony, and it's based on hearsay outside the

scope of this witness' testimony.

THE COURT:  It's not in Mrs. Shulman's

deposition?

THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    You can answer, sir.

A    I believe she would bring him things to read.  I remember that somewhat.

Q    Isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman testified that when she would see information on television that smoking was harmful, that she would bring that information to Mr. Shulman's attention?

A    That sounds right.  She was trying to get him to quit smoking the whole relationship, the whole marriage.

Q    In the beginning of their marriage Mrs. Shulman bought cigarettes for Mr. Shulman, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    But she stopped buying cigarettes for him early in the marriage, didn't she?

A    I don't remember the exact timeline, I'm sorry.

Q    She stopped buying cigarettes for Mr. Shulman before their sons were born, right?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember that detail. MR. FURR:  Can I have Volume 3 of

Q   Please confirm first for us, sir, that I've

handed you Volume 3 of Mrs. Shulman's deposition

taken December 3, 2014?

A    Yes.

Q   Let me ask you to turn to page 208,

lines 15 through 21.

A    Page 208?

Q   Are you there?

A    Yes.

Q   Sir, isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman was

asked the following questions and gave the following

answers?

Question:  Okay.  Were you still buying

cigarettes for your husband when your sons were born?

Answer:  No.

Question:  You were not?  You had stopped

by that point?

Answer:  Right.

Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A    Yes, you did.

could you please read at 208 the question at

line 23 and the answer at line 2 on the next

page, 209, please?

MR. FURR:  Sure.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Question:  Yes, ma'am, but is it true that

by the time your sons Bruce and Harvey were born you

were no longer purchasing cigarettes for your

husband?

Answer:  I don't remember.

Did I read that question and answer

correctly?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Actually through line 6.

MR. FURR:  That's unrelated, it has to do

with specific brands, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, the brands

pertain to the years that he smoked.  That's why

he needs to continue.

MR. FURR:  I'll try to get this done.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Question:  When you bought cigarettes for

your husband, do you remember what brands you bought

him?

Did I read that correctly?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, to try to time stamp this thing with respect to Mrs. Shulman buying cigarettes for Mr. Shulman, their oldest son Bruce was born in 1943; is that correct?

A    That sounds right.

Q    You mentioned this before, but isn't it also true that Mrs. Shulman told Mr. Shulman not to smoke around the children because she believed that cigarette smoke would be harmful to their health?

A    I don't remember it quite like that, but that's very possible.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  Could I have

Mrs. Shulman's Deposition Volume 2. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You have it up there, sir.  If I could ask you to find Volume 2 of Mrs. Shulman's deposition, it's from October 13, 2014.

A    Volume 2 you're saying?

Q    Yes, sir.  I'll give you page and line as soon as you get there.

A    I have it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Can I approach, Judge?

THE COURT:  Is there an objection?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I move to strike as he

didn't connect it to Mr. Shulman.  He's talking

about what Ethel knew and what Ethel's concerns

concern were, but he doesn't -- this is not

connected to, did you tell that to Mr. Shulman

or is this from Mrs. -- that's why I said

outside the scope before, but on one of them you

went ahead and connected it to Mr. Shulman.

This one he's not connecting to Mr. Shulman.

He's just saying Ethel didn't like it.

MR. FURR:  Mrs. Shulman �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I move to strike that

last question and answer.

Page 6003 THE COURT:  He was asking her about what

Mr. Shulman said relative to this.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, no, I know that � here is what they didn't connect and why I say, she said she told Mr. Shulman -- she didn't like her husband's smoking around them.  I didn't object to that.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Then he went into a litany of questions about why Mrs. Shulman didn't like her husband smoking around them.  It was all about what Mrs. Shulman thought about smoking being harmful to the children.  There's nothing in there about Mr. Shulman thinking the smoking was harmful to the children or that Mrs. Shulman told Mr. Shulman it was harmful.

THE COURT:  This witness said he came to his conclusions based on reading both Ethel Shulman's and Mr. Shulman's deposition, so these questions are designed to challenge that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He is an expert on Mr. Shulman's addiction to cigarettes.

THE COURT:  Where are you reading Mrs. Shulman's deposition?  Didn't he rely on Mrs. Shulman's deposition for his conclusions?

deal with it in redirect because it's part of

the depositions that he reviewed.

in time a little bit, sir.  You know that � you know

the names of Mr. Shulman's sons?

A    Yes.

Q

A

Q right ?

A

Bruce and Harvey?

Yes.

You know they were born in the 1940s,

Yes

Q    Isn't it true, sir, that when they were growing up, Mr. Shulman told them not to smoke cigarettes?

Page 6005 A    Well, they didn't -- no, they said they

don't remember those conversations with him.  That's

what I read.

Q    Didn't Mrs. Shulman testify that their

father told Bruce and Harvey not to smoke cigarettes?

A She said -- and she thought that he had done that, but that -- I believe that Harvey said that he doesn't remember that conversation.

Q    Right.  I'm asking you what Mrs. Shulman said?

A

That's what Mrs. Shulman said

Q    Okay.  Didn't Mrs. Shulman testify that Mr. Shulman told Bruce and Harvey that smoking was a bad addiction?

A    That sounds like something -- she was very anti-smoking.  It sounds like something she would have said to her children.

Q    You don't dispute that, do you?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor. Ms. Shulman and the children, this witness � it's outside the scope of this witness' testimony about Mr. Shulman's dependence. That's what his area was.  This is not Mr. Shulman right now. BY MR. FURR:

Page 6006 Q    Maybe the question wasn't clear.  The

question was, Mrs. Shulman testified that Mr. Shulman

told Bruce and Harvey that smoking was a bad

addiction, right?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's double hearsay, Judge, I object.

MR. FURR:  The testing is what he relied upon, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Multiple hearsay objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule it to the extent that you rephrase it to make sure that's clear that it's based on what the witness reviewed in coming to his conclusions. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Based upon your review of Mrs. Shulman's depositions that you conducted in coming to your conclusions in preparing to come and testify here, isn't it true that Mrs. Shulman in the materials that you reviewed testified that Mr. Shulman told Bruce and Harvey that smoking was a bad addiction?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  She was under the impression

BY MR. FURR:

Q    And that he told them that it was a bad addiction, right?

A    That was her impression.

Q    And isn't it true, further, sir, that based upon your review of Mrs. Shulman's testimony that you reviewed in preparation for your testimony here that Mrs. Shulman testified that she and Mr. Shulman told Bruce and Harvey that they should not be smoking because it was addictive, it was bad for them, and unhealthy?

A    That's possible.  I don't remember those exact words, but it's very possible.

MR. FURR:  Could I have Volume 2, please? BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, I'm going to ask you to pick up Volume 2 of Mrs. Shulman's deposition.

A    Okay.

Q    Let me know when you have that one, sir, and I'11 direct you to a page and a line.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that during her deposition Mrs. Shulman was asked these questions and gave these answers?

Question:  Before Bruce and Harvey were smokers, to your knowledge, did you and Mr. Shulman tell them that they should not smoke cigarettes? Answer:  Yes.

Question:  What do you remember telling Bruce and Harvey about cigarette smoking before you knew that they smoked cigarettes?

Answer:  That it was addictive, it was bad for them, and unhealthy.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

A    Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Mr. Furr, would you for the sake of completeness, on page 183, just continue and read line 14 through 23, please?

Q   Are you still with me, Dr. Seidman? A    Yes.

Q    183, line 14, isn't it true that during Mrs. Shulman's deposition she was asked these questions and gave these answers?

Question:  And I believe the last time you had a recollection of Bruce and Harvey being told that cigarette smoking was addictive and cigarette smoking wasn't healthy from when they were around the ages of six to nine; is that right?

Answer:  No � older.

Question:  They were older?

Answer:  Older.

So � Question:  So when do you remember � strike that.

Do you remember yourself telling Bruce and Harvey that cigarette smoking was addictive, bad for them, and unhealthy, and that they should not smoke?

Answer:  High school age.

Correct?

A    Yes.  Well, see, if they were born in the mid '40s, yeah, late '50s.

Q    Okay.  Sir, Mr. Shulman � based upon your review of his deposition testimony, sir, you are aware that Mr. Shulman read the newspaper the Boston Globe, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Mr. Shulman in his deposition testified that he remembered articles in the Boston Globe reporting on messages from the Surgeon General, correct?

A    I'm sorry, I don't remember that.  I remember him mostly reading the sports pages, but I'm not sure.

MR. FURR:  Could I have Mr. Shulman's

deposition, Volume 10?

May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Sure.

the Surgeon General's � something about the

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Thank you.

Sir, isn't it also true that in his deposition Mr. Shulman testified that he remembered seeing messages on the side of cigarette packages?

A    Now we're getting much later.  The Surgeon General is '64 and then �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge � I have an objection.

THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  May it please the Court? It's outside the scope.  It's outside the scope of this witness' testimony.  This is addiction, dependence, Ph.D. psychologist, it's outside the scope, the warnings.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, this witness testified that Mr. Shulman did not believe that smoking was dangerous and that he did not believe that an American company would sell a dangerous product, so I want this witness to tell the jury that Mr. Shulman knew there was a warning on the side of the package.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's a good point.  I withdraw my objection.

THE COURT:  All right.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Mr. Shulman in his deposition testified that he remembered seeing messages on the side of the package, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    And he remembered reading the message, Caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health, right?

A    The caution in 1966, yes.

Q    Right.

A    He talked about that.

Q    He remembered that, right?

A    He thought it was a government regulation that they had to fulfill, he didn't believe it.

Q    Sir, my question was, he remembers reading that, right?  Is the answer yes?

A    They were always on the side of the packs when he was smoking, so, sure, after 1966 and then in 1970 with the warnings, yeah.

Q    And he remembered seeing those warnings on the package, right?

A    Yes, he thought it was a government regulation.

A    Yes, I've said that a number of times.

Q    I'm laying a foundation for the Court in some ways, sir.

Isn't it true that Harvey Shulman testified that he remembers seeing the same message, that is, Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health, on cigarettes?

A    That sounds familiar.

Q Isn't it true that the very first package of cigarettes that he saw with that warning on them he showed them to his father?

A    That's very possible.

Q Isn't it true that when he showed them to his father, he said, see, I told you, I told you?

A    Well, I don't know when he quit because he was a smoker, too, so --

Q    Can you answer my question?

A   He said, I told you, I told you, in 1966?

Q   Yes.

A    When the warning came out?  I don't remember that.

may be hazardous to your health?

It was a basic warning.

your father?

Question:  When did you show that warning

to your father?

Answer:  The first pack that I got.

Question:  What did you say to him?

Answer:  I said, see, I told you, I told

you, you know, over and over and over again.  Now

Question:  Did he say anything in response?

What do you want me to do?  I can't quit.  I can't

quit.  I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I can't

at that point � it's like �

Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A    You did.

Q    Okay.  Now, in that question and answer Harvey Shulman is implicitly saying that he had been warning his father about the dangers of smoking before the first caution message came on the package, right ?

A    They started talking about it.  They said that the science really came out in the '70s and he was learning more about it and he was bringing it to his father.  This would be in the '70s at some point?

Q    No, sir.  My question is, when Harvey Shulman says, see, I told you, I told you, you know, over and over again, now it's in print, that means that Harvey had been warning him before the caution label went on the package, right?

A    He was trying to appeal to his rationality,

Q    So is your answer, yes, he had been trying

to warn him before the caution label came on the

package?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Your Honor. THE WITNESS:  Warning and caution are two different things.  You are confusing them. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Had he been telling him that smoking was bad for his health before the caution went on the package?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, my objection is at page 3 they're talking about a warning. On page 114, line 3, it says warning.  I object. THE COURT:  There's a difference between a warning and a label, is that what you're saying?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  There were cautions in '66.  It was changed to a warning in '70.

MR. FURR:  I'll just change the question. THE COURT:  Rephrase the question. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Isn't it true that Harvey Shulman implicitly stated right there that he had been providing information to his father about the dangers of smoking before the caution label appeared in

A    He was supplying information, but he was addicted so he couldn't use the information.

Q    The question was about information, yes or no?

A it, yes.

Q    Thank you.

And in his deposition Harvey Shulman testified that he, in fact, showed the pack warning to his father multiple times, right?

A    Yeah.  He was bringing all kinds of science and he was saying, look, this is � things are coming out now in the public.  There's more of a debate. The debate heated up in the '80s, but in the '70s more information was coming out, and he was bringing it to his father and saying, this is a dangerous product.

Q    He would also tell his father, you're going to quit, you're going to get sick, quit this, right?

A    He was telling him everything he could think of.  They were fighting weekly, they said.  He said it was the most frustrating thing, they would fight about this.

Q    And he would tell his father, you're going

it �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I move to strike

everything after, Yeah, that's right �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.  It's

not � the witness has answered the question

given the time parameters that are being

talking about something else, Your Honor.

to be nonresponsive to the question, so I will

strike it.  The jury should disregard it.

Mr. Shulman that smoking could cause heart attacks?

Q    And cancer, right?

A    Is that what it says right here?  I didn't read that, but he was talking about the science as it was coming out in those days.

Q    By the way, in addition to the information Mr. Shulman was getting from his family, Mr. Shulman himself testified that he saw plenty of stories in the newspapers about smoking harming people, right?

A    He said in the 1980s, the horror stories were coming out left and right in the media, and that's when Yvonne spoke to him and tried to break through to him with her support and her challenging of the way he thinks about this and his beliefs.

Q    Did you say 1980s?

A    Yeah, that's when they worked together was the 1980s, not the 1970s.

Q    Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman subscribed to the Reader's Digest?

A    I'm sorry, I don't know if they subscribed to it.  If it's here, it's here.

Q    Do you challenge that Mr. Shulman � I'd like not to have to get a transcript out.

A    Right.

A    It may have come to the family, I don't know.

Q    Isn't it true that Mr. Shulman recalled seeing stories about cigarette smoking in the Reader's Digest?

A    Well, I remember that the horror stories were coming out in the '80s, when he was working with Yvonne, and when his son could no longer stand talking to him about it because he was so frustrated he asked his wife to do it.  They were married in the late '70s, and this happened in the '80s.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I hate to do it.  I

way to my question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge.

Objection.  They're talking about the timeframe,

and the witness is answering based on when the

timeframe is.

MR. FURR:  That was not my question.

unresponsive to the -- the answer is totally

unresponsive to the question.  I'm going to

A    Yes.

Q    Now, sir, are you aware that in 1959 the

Reader's Digest published an article titled The

Growing Horrors of Lung Cancer? A I've never seen that. Q    Okay.  Now, I want to back up to something

you said.  You said that Harvey Shulman began

discussing with his father information about the data

and the dangers of smoking as it began coming out,

right ?

A    That's what he says, that as he was

learning about it in the 1970s, he was bringing it to

his father.  That's what I read him say.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that information about

the dangers of smoking began coming out in the

newspapers in huge volumes in the 1950s?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I object. Outside the scope of direct.  I'm starting to have a flashback to Dr. Proctor's testimony at this juncture.  This witness is a � specific to Mr. Shulman's addiction to cigarettes and whether or not he's addicted to cigarettes, issues along those lines.  He is now asking him about articles in the '50s.  I think it's

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, isn't it true that Mr. Shulman testified that he is not certain as to when he quit permanently ?

A    He said either the mid '80s or late '80s, that's what he says.

Q    Could I have � no, it's too late.  Never mind.

Sir, now, you mentioned today on a couple of occasions the possibility that after Mr. Shulman quit smoking that he might have relapsed, didn't you?

A    I'm trying to understand how there is some evidence from 1975, some -- he says that it was mid to late '80s, and his son says it's when he got cancer.  I'm trying to put that together, and from my own experience, even people who I thought were quitting, I have a medical doctor who I thought quit, and she was outside smoking after a session --

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, this is

completely not responsive to my question.  He's

talking about some other individual.

of relapse --

question and answer again.

I'm going to strike the portion where he

says, In my own experience even people who I

thought were quitting, I have a medical doctor

who I thought quit, and she was out smoking

after smoking cessation -- that is completely

unresponsive to the question that was asked.

That portion of his answer is stricken and the

jury should disregard it. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, isn't it true that in the deposition material that you reviewed that Mr. Shulman testified that after he quit smoking, he never smoked another cigarette?

A    When he quit in the mid to late '80s, that's what he says.

Q    Sir, he didn't attach the mid to late '80s to those answers, he just said what I said, right?

A    No.  When he quit with Yvonne, that's what he said.  That's what he attributed it to.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  Could I have Volume 7,

please? BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, do you have Volume 7 up there of Mr. Shulman's deposition?

Page 6030 mind at that point that smoking could cause disease?

Answer:  Yep, there was no doubt � excuse me.

Answer:  Yes, there was doubt in my mind. The tobacco companies kept on telling everybody in the public the magic of filters, filters would take this out of cigarettes, they had me convinced that I could be all right to smoke if I had filtered cigarettes.

That was the publicity from the tobacco companies themselves.  That's why they put filters on the cigarettes, because they take out a lot of the harmful ingredients and so forth.  That's what complicated the situation more.  That's what made it harder to quit.

Question:  But regardless, at that point, you said those stories in your words scared the hell out of you?

Answer:  Yeah.

Question: So at this point when you started to cut down the amount you smoked, you finally quit permanently?

Answer:  Right.

Did I read those questions and answers correctly?

a series of medical records that contained some

information from his � in his own medical records

in evidence about when he quit.

Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I want to look at a couple more of those.

Q.  So again, doing the math, if this is 1995, 20 years previously would have been 1975, right ?

A.  That's what it says. Q.  Okay.  Let's go to the next record, which is a record � another record from the Maine Medical Center.

Any reason to dispute that? A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  Do you see here it says: Nonsmoker, 25 years, right?

A.  Yes, that's what it looks like.

Page 6047 Q.  So of course, subtracting 25 from the

year 2000, we would again be back in 1975, right?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So, sir, during the course of looking at these medical records, would you agree with me, we have now seen a total of 13 records placing Mr. Shulman's quit date at 1978 or earlier?

A.  That's what it says in the medical records.

Q.  Thank you.

A.  In these medical records.

Q.  There are some other medical records. Later there are some medical records that say different things, right?

A.  I think so, but I � I � that's what � that's what you just showed us, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  Well, I want to try to see if we can talk about this, when Mr. Shulman finally quit, and in a little bit more detail.  Okay?

You began telling us this on Tuesday, but, sir, isn't it true that Mr. Shulman's � the information that you reviewed in Mr. Shulman's testimony is that the main cause of him finally quitting was his discussion with his

Page 604� daughter-in-law, Yvonne?

A.  I said that was a contributing cause.  I said from the beginning that he either quit in 1975, 1985, the late '80s, or when he got the cancer, and that it's unclear in the totality of the record which one it is.

I've said that from the beginning.

Q.  I'm not asking you right now about a date.  I'm only asking you:  Isn't it true that based upon your review of the record, that Mr. Shulman said that most of the cause for his quitting was his conversation with his daughter-in-law, Yvonne?

A.  He said she had a big impact on him, and those discussions took place in the � in the '80s.

Q.  Sir, isn't it also true that the record reflects that � Mr. Shulman's testimony was that his daughter-in-law, Yvonne, provided to him information about how smoking had affected her family's health?

A.  Her father had died from it.  She had other relatives who had died from it.  And he said that it went from seeming like an abstract thing to something personal to him, the way she

Page 6049

described it.

Q.  Now Mr. Shulman also said in his deposition, didn't he, that when Yvonne told him about the health effects that her family had suffered, that it was no surprise to him?

A.  I'm not sure what the context is of that, but, you know �

Q.  Okay.  Well, we can clarify it. A.  That may be one of the things that he said about it, but he � the main thing that he said was that it became personal to him as opposed to something you read in the newspaper when he � when she discussed what it meant to her and what happened to her father, it really broke through his idea that they wouldn't sell it if it was unhealthy.  That's what he said.

MR. FURR:  Can I have Volume 10 of the deposition, please?

May I approach the witness, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Seidman. (Hands transcript.)

Page 6051 Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  You told the jury that

you had reviewed the transcript of Dr. Hoge's

interview of Mr. Shulman also, correct?

A.  Yeah, I think he interviewed him for three or four hours, something like that.

Q.  Right, he interviewed him on two sessions for two hours at a time, right?

A.  Yes, in addition to the 12 hours of regular testimony, yeah.

Q.  Sir, isn't it true that in his interview with Dr. Hoge that Mr. Shulman said that Yvonne challenged him to throw his cigarettes away?

A.  That sounds right.  She challenged his belief system.  She challenged him to quit.  That was what she was doing.

Q. And isn't it true that Mr. Shulman said that when Yvonne challenged him to quit, that he took the cigarette out of his mouth, right?

A.  Well, that may be there.  I don't remember that detail, but, yeah.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  Could I have that transcript, please?

THE WITNESS:  No, I'm willing to say that he threw it out at that point.

ANSWER:  No.

QUESTION:  Many times?

ANSWER:  Many times, but it was never � never so intense other times.  But this time, this particular time, it was.  It rattled � it really rattled my brain.

QUESTION:  Okay.

ANSWER:  And it � it � what she told me was so hard to compute in my head and so devastating that she challenged me to throw the cigarette away, which I had.  I was smoking at the time.

QUESTION:  You were smoking while you were talking to her?

ANSWER:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  And then she challenged you to quit right there?

ANSWER:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  And what did you do?

ANSWER:  Urn, I took the cigarette out of my mouth � I remember this vividly � took the cigarette out of my mouth and started to think � and I love this girl, and I wanted to please her, so I took my cigarettes, threw them into the waste basket, and I told her I would never smoke

QUESTION:  Was this at your home?

ANSWER:  Yeah, my home.

Did I read those guestions and answers

correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So as we just saw, Mr. Shulman testified

that he had a vivid memory of the conversation and

taking the cigarette out of his mouth and telling

Yvonne he would never smoke again, right?

A.  This is in the 1980s, you're talking

about?

Q.  Well, we're going to get to that.  I

didn't ask you anything about the date yet.

A.  Okay.  So that's what it says.

Q.  Okay.  And he said � the question was:

Was this at your home?

And he said:  Yeah, my home.

Right?

A.  That's what he says.

Q.  And then isn't it also true that

Mr. Shulman told Dr. Hoge that after he threw his

cigarettes away right there, that he never had

another cigarette in his life?

Page 6055 Q.  He said that he didn't taper down.  He

just threw them away and never had another

cigarette, right?

A.  I'm not sure about the taper part.  He may have tapered a little bit, but he says that's when he quit, in the mid to late '80s.  That's what he said.

Q.  Well, let's look at this a little closer.  We'11 pick up right where we left off on Page 23, Line 17.

The first question:  Okay.  And where were you living at this time?

ANSWER:  Winthrop, Massachusetts.

QUESTION:  This is when you were in Winthrop.  Okay.

So you threw them away right there while you were talking to her � talking to her?

QUESTION:  That's what you did?

QUESTION:  And you never had one again?

ANSWER:  Right.

Did I read those guestions and answers

A.  Yes.

Q.  So Mr. Shulman told Dr. Hoge that he did

not taper down, that he simply threw them away and

said, are you?

vividly remembers where he took his cigarettes out

and threw them away was when he lived in Winthrop,

correct?

A.  That's what it says there, yeah.

Q.  He also said that, in his deposition, that Yvonne's stories scared the hell out of him, right ?

A.  He said there were horror stories in the media and that she broke through to him and made it real to him, made it personal to him.

Q.  He said she scared the hell out of him, right ?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Well, let me just ask it to you this way:  Isn't it also true, sir, that Mr. Shulman testified that he never went back to smoking after that day?

Q.  Now you � sir, are you aware that Harvey Shulman and Yvonne Shulman that we've been discussing were married in August of 1977?

A.  That's what we just talked about, right.

Q.  Right.  And as we discussed, in his � in his � in that medical examination by Dr. Hoge, he said that happened in Winthrop, Massachusetts, right ?

A.  I believe that's what you showed us, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  And isn't it true, sir, that in his deposition, Mr. Shulman testified that Yvonne talked to him about the dangers of smoking when he lived at One Grovers Avenue, Winthrop, Massachusetts?  Do you remember that?

Can you remember where you were living when Yvonne started talking � when Yvonne started telling you this information and asking you to quit smoking?

ANSWER:  Yes, I can. Tell us where you were.

ANSWER:  One Grovers Avenue, Winthrop, Massachusetts.

Right? A.  Yes, that's right.

Q.  Now let's see if we can tie some of this together, because we looked at � we just saw it altogether, Mr. Shulman told Dr. Hoge he lived in Winthrop when he stopped smoking, right? A.  Yes.

Q. And in the deposition, he was a little more specific. He said he lived at One Grovers Avenue when Yvonne was talking to him, correct? A.  Okay.

Q.  I mean, we just saw that, right? A.  We just saw that.

Q.  Sir, I've just written on the board the date of November 29, 1979, right?

A.  Okay.  It doesn't change my opinion about addiction one way or the other.

Q.  One step at a time here.

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  Are you aware that on this day, the Shulmans sold this home that had the same address as Mr. Shulman testified as the location where he spoke to Yvonne?

Were you aware of that fact?

A.  No, I wouldn't be aware of that fact, but �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge. It's outside the scope of direct.  Where he began � where Yvonne started speaking to him is not anything he even said.  It's got nothing to do with his opinions in the case

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, it has everything to do with what he explained about the quit date.

Page 6067 QUESTION:  And when you had built this

place in Maine, did you still live in the place

that you had built in Winthrop?

ANSWER:  Trying to think.  I don't remember whether we sold it and moved to an apartment.  We moved to an apartment in Winthrop and went summers in Maine.

QUESTION:  And when did you build the place in Maine?

ANSWER:  I don't remember the year.

QUESTION:  And you said that you would spend the summers in Maine and the winters in Winthrop?

ANSWER:  Right.

When you spent the summers in Winthrop, would it be in the apartment you had?

ANSWER:  We spent in Winthrop in the apartment, and my husband did not like the apartment, so we moved to an apartment in Maiden.

Did I read that correct � correctly? A.  Pretty much.

Q.  So you see that after they sold the home they built in Winthrop in 19- � well, you don't know the year, they then moved to an apartment, correct?

ANSWER:  Six months, a year.  I don't

remember.

Did I read those questions and answers

correctly?

A.  Not really.  It says:  Maybe six months, but that's � that's picky.

Q.  Maybe six months, a year, I don't remember, right?

A.  Yeah, she doesn't remember.

Q.  She said:  Maybe six months, a year, right ?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So if, in fact, the One Grovers Avenue home was sold in 1979, and we assume they lived for a whole year at the apartment in Winthrop, the last time that the Shulmans lived in Winthrop was 1980, correct?

A.  Well, that's the way you're presenting it.  I don't know when they lived where.  I don't have any knowledge about that.  I'm here to testify about addiction.

Q.  Isn't that what the records we just looked at show?

A.  That's what you're � that's what you're

or where they lived, and she didn't seem that

clear about it either.

Q.  Okay.  I want you to assume that we're going to prove later in this case that this home was sold on this date, on 11-29-1979.  Okay?

Will you make that assumption for me?

A.  Sure.

Q.  So if they left that home then and they lived in the apartment � in the apartment in Winthrop for a year, that means that the last time they lived in Winthrop would have been 1980, correct?

A.  According to � yes.

Q. And if Mr. Shulman is correct that he remembers when � that he quit while living in Winthrop, then he quit before 1980, correct?

A.  It doesn't change my opinion in any way.

Q.  Can you answer my question?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Again, Judge, I think it's outside the scope of direct.  It's argumentative.  This witness has not, in any way, been asked to specialize in this particular detail of this case.

Page 6071 MR. FURR:  On direct examination,, the

witness testified at length his opinion about when

Mr. Shulman quit.  That's what I'm addressing.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to overrule it.

And even if it was beyond the scope, I can always reopen your � your direct if you don't want to cover it on redirect � I mean, if you don't want to cover it on redirect.

Go ahead. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  So we don't lose my question, if Mr. Shulman, with his vivid memory, is correct that he quit while living in Winthrop and that the One Grovers Avenue home was sold in 1979 and Mrs. Shulman is correct that the outside � the longest amount of time they lived in the Winthrop apartment was one year, then that means that Mr. Shulman quit smoking before 1980, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  My objection, Judge, is that it's overbroad, argumentative, and it misstates the predicate.

He's taking � taking the man's vivid recollection of the story with Yvonne and creating a vivid recollection of when he lived in Winthrop.

MR. FURR:  It's the same passage we read, Your Honor, where Mr. Shulman said he had a vivid recollection.

We also read the portion in that passage where he was talking about quitting while living in Winthrop.

THE COURT:  Let's see here.  Hang on a second.

Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Can you answer? A.  I'm sorry, I don't remember the question.

Q.  Okay.  I'11 be glad to repeat it.

If Mr. Shulman, with his vivid recollection is correct, with his vivid memory of quitting when he lived in Winthrop.

And if later the deeds, in fact, show that the One Grovers Avenue home was sold and the Shulmans no longer lived there after January � excuse me, November 29th, 1979, and Mrs. Shulman is correct that they lived in an apartment in Winthrop for at the most one year, the last time the Shulmans could have lived in Winthrop was

And, therefore, Mr. Shulman quit smoking before 1980, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Same objections, Judge, stacking inferences now and asking for an opinion outside the scope of this witness's qualifications.

MR. FURR:  Same question you just ruled on, Your Honor.  He asked me to repeat the question.  That's what I did.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I think there's evidence that he quit in 1975.  There's evidence that he quit later.

And I'm � it doesn't affect my opinion one way or another, whether he quit in '75, '85, or when he got the cancer.  My opinion is exactly the same.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  So is the answer to my question "correct"?

A.  No, I don't think we know.  I think that there's a lot of evidence that it must have been later.  And there's some medical evidence that it might have been '75.

There's evidence that it might have been

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Let me ask you a different question.

You have testified on multiple occasions that Mr. Shulman said that he quit in 1985, right?

A.  No, that's not right.  I said:  It's either '75, '85, late '80s, or when he got the cancer.

I've said the same thing all along, and I said it doesn't affect my opinion.

Q.  What you testified with respect to what you've told this jury about Mr. Shulman, you've told this jury multiple times that Mr. Shulman quit in 1985, right?

A.  That's what he says.  He says �

Q.  Okay.  And that's what you told �

A.  � he has a vivid memory.  It doesn't mean that he had it in 1975, 1980, '85, '89, or when he got the cancer.

A.  So a vivid memory is all you're talking about.

Q.  Let me ask you to � well, yes, we only have his memories of these events.  We don't have a video of it, do we?

Let me ask you a different question. Try to track my question.  Okay?

Isn't it true that you have told this jury multiple times that Mr. Shulman testified that he quit in 1985?

A.  He said that he didn't quit in 1975.  He said that's not correct.

He said that he quit in the mid to the late '80s, and that he had this experience with Yvonne.  That's true.

And his son says he didn't really quit until he got the cancer.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, my question is what he told his jury, not a recitation of the facts different than what I ask about.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  It's a simple question. Didn't you tell this jury on multiple times on Tuesday that Mr. Shulman testified that he quit in 1985?

A.  It's not a simple question.  You keep asking a question that doesn't have a simple answer.

THE COURT:  The witness � the witness

should not argue with the questioner.  The witness

should just answer the question, please.

THE WITNESS:  Okay, Your Honor.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Do you want me to ask it

one more time?

A.  I've indicated yes many times, that he

believes that he quit in the mid to the late '80s,

and he doesn't believe me quit in '75.

He said that a number of times in a

number of different places.

Q.  Okay.  That's my point.

But isn't it also true that Mr. Shulman

said that he was not certain that he quit in

1980s?

A.  I do not remember that.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go back to the transcript

you have up there of Dr. Hoge's interview with

Mr. Shulman.

And let's  go to Page  24,   Lines  23

Did I read those correctly? MR. SCHLESINGER:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So here's my question for you: In the medical examination, in addition to testifying that he quit in the mid to late '80s,

whether he quit in the '80s, right?  That's what

we just looked at.

A.  Well, that's how you're picking and choosing, right?

Q.  Isn't that what he � no, you're picking and choosing �

A.  No, I'm not picking and choosing. Q.  � because you told the jury that he quit in 1985 and that's what he said.  And you didn't tell the jury that Mr. Shulman said he wasn't certain about that, did you?

A.  Well, when you ask an old man a lot of questions �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Before you answer � Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Isn't that correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  My objection, "I'm not; you are," that's argumentative, Judge.

THE COURT:  Well, he � the witness started it because the witness keeps not responding to the questions.  The witness is arguing with the questioner.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir. THE COURT:  So I'm going to overrule the objection, and I'm going to instruct � I've

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Isn't it true, sir, that you chose to tell this jury that Mr. Shulman said he quit in the 1980s, and you chose not to share with this jury that Mr. Shulman said that he wasn't certain that he quit in the 1980s?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Again, Judge, that's argumentative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS

That's a detail that I did

not remember until you pointed it out to me. Thank you.

It doesn't change my opinion.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  I want to go back to something else along these same lines.

You told the jury that Mr. Shulman said that after he switched to filters, he went to � he increased his smoking and that he went to two-plus packs per day, right?

A.  That's what I remember from � from the volumes, yeah.

Q.  But isn't it also true that in Mr. Shulman's sworn testimony in this case, that

Page 6083 he said he smoked the same number of cigarettes

per day after he switched to filters?

A.  Well, he may have said different things in different places.

My impression was that he had trouble getting enough nicotine out of the cigarette after he switched to the filters and that he was already at two packs a day, and he went up from there.

That's my impression.

MR. FURR:  May I have Volume 9, please, of Mr. Shulman's deposition?

May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  (Hands transcript.)

QUESTION:  And when you started smoking the filtered cigarette, did you change the way you smoked your cigarettes?

ANSWER:  I don't know � I don't know how you can change the way you smoke them.

QUESTION:  You smoked the same number of cigarettes you had smoked before changing to filters?

ANSWER:  Yeah, I did.

Did   I   read  those   questions   and  answers correctly.

Q.  So in at least part of the record,

Mr. Shulman indicated that after he switched to

filters, he smoked the same number of cigarettes

per day, right?

A.  In that section, yes.

Q.  Right.  But you chose, when testifying to this jury, to only tell them about Mr. Shulman's testimony regarding smoking more cigarettes after switching, and you didn't tell this jury that the record was inconsistent on this issue also, did you, sir?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Wait, wait, Judge, may I approach, please?

THE COURT:  Yep.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Two objections. Its � it's � it's argumentative, but, more so, Your Honor prohibited me from using the testimony of Mr. Shulman.

Whenever I tried to refer to the testimony specifically, I was � there was an objection.  I was prohibited.

And so, as a result, this witness had to

the case.  He could not quote from the testimony.

So now Mr. Furr is putting him in a position where he says:  You chose not to show testimony.

That's after Mr. Furr objected to us showing testimony.

So that's � that's not appropriate, Judge.

THE COURT:  I don't recall that.  Do you guys have that on a transcript somewhere?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, not a single �

MR. FURR:  And I did not say:  You chose not to show testimony, because what this witness could have done on direct, he could have said: The evidence was inconsistent, but here's my opinion and why.

He could have acknowledged to the jury there was evidence cutting both ways.  Instead, he chose to testify as though the evidence only went one way.

And what I'm doing is what we talked about on Tuesday, Your Honor.  I'm simply showing the jury that there was record evidence that he reviewed that he chose � inconsistent with his

Okay.  But you chose, when testifying to the jury, to only tell them about Mr. Shulman's testimony regarding smoking more cigarettes after switching, and you didn't tell the jury that the record was inconsistent on this issue?

MR. BRENNER:  Right.

MR. FURR:  Yeah, I'm going to rephrase it without the word "testimony."

THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  Dr. Seidman, the question is this, sir:  When you testified to the jury that Mr. Shulman increased his smoking when he switched to filters, you chose not to tell the jury that there was inconsistent evidence in the record with respect to whether Mr. Shulman, in fact, increased his smoking, didn't you, sir?

A.  I looked at the preponderance, all � all of the evidence, and what I came up with was the idea that he was not getting as much nicotine from the cigarettes.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, he's not responding to my question.

THE WITNESS:  Well, that is � that is

the issue �

MR. FURR: He's not responding to my guestion.

THE WITNESS:  It's compensation.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, that's not fair.  He's definitely responding to the guestion.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.

I'm going to instruct the witness to be responsive to the guestion.  Please answer the guestion.

THE WITNESS: I didn't remember that detail, but I answered � I answered the way I thought was proper.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  I want to ask you about a slightly different topic, and that is: You told the jury on Tuesday � you provided the jury your opinion about how an individual's social environment, their immediate social environment is important with respect to whether they become a cigarette smoker.

Do you remember giving that testimony? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  I want to talk about Mr. Shulman � your understanding of Mr. Shulman's

Wouldn't you agree that Mr. Shulman's

parents never smoked?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Wouldn't you agree that his siblings never smoked?

A.  I guess that's correct.

Q.  You don't dispute that, do you?

A.  I don't remember.  There was maybe on her side somebody was a smoker, yeah.

Q.  I'm talking about Mr. Shulman.

A.  I know.  I know.  I don't think so. You're right.

Q.  Okay.  And wouldn't you agree that Mrs. Shulman's family did not smoke?

A.  I think her sister died of lung cancer, didn't she?

Q.  Okay.  Well, let me ask you:  Wouldn't you agree that Mrs. Shulman's parents did not smoke?

A.  Her parents didn't smoke.  Her sister was a smoker who died of lung cancer.

A.  Oh, yeah.

Q.  Sir, based upon your review of the record, isn't it also true that Mrs. Shulman never saw Mr. Shulman smoke in front of his parents?

A.  Mr. Shulman never saw �

Q.  No.  Mrs. Shulman never saw Mr. Shulman smoke in front of his parents?

A.  That's possible.  I don't remember that detail.  There's thousands of pages.

MR. FURR:  Could I have Mrs. Shulman's deposition, Volume 1?

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Doctor, if you would, please, turn to Page 64, Lines 21 through 23.

A.  Where am I looking?

Q.  Yes, sir, it's Volume 1 of Mrs. Shulman's deposition.

A.  What was the page number?

Q.  Page 64.  Let's look at Lines 21 through 23.

Are you there?

A.  I'm on Page 64 now.

Q.  Okay.  Isn't it true that during her deposition, Mrs. Shulman was asked this question and gave this answer:

Page 6095 QUESTION:  Did you ever see Mr. Shulman

smoke in front of his parents?

And the answer was:  No.

Did I read that question correctly?

A.  Yes, you did.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's on Page 64?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And isn't it also true

that Mrs. Shulman testified that Mr. Shulman tried

to hide his smoking from her parents?

A.  Well, she didn't like it and her parents

didn't like it.  And it was a � it was against

him in their book, so that's very possible.

Q.  Do you remember that?  Do you dispute

that in any way?

A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  Again, looking at Mr. Shulman's

social environment, isn't it true that during the

medical examination by Dr. Hoge, Mr. Shulman

stated that at the time he began smoking, it was

frowned upon for kids to be smoking and that they

did it in defiance?

A.  There is something about that in the

record, but I � I'm sorry, I don't remember that

detail.

And it was against the school rules. His mother clearly didn't like it.  We went over that already.

Q.  Right.  And Mr. Shulman actually said they smoked "in defiance," right?

A.  They smoked in the bathroom.  They got caught.  They got in trouble.

So obviously, it was against the rules in school.

Q.  And the word he chose to use was "defiance," correct?

A.  That's possible.

Q.  Okay.  Last topic.  I want to make sure the jury understands the compensation that you have received for the testimony here, or will receive in this litigation.

Your hourly rate for reviewing materials is $300 an hour; is that correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Your deposition and trial testimony is $600 per hour; is that correct?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.      In  other words,   $4800  a  day,   right?

A.      That's   correct.

A.  Yeah.

Q.  So that's another $10,000 or so, right?

A.  That sounds about right.

Q.  So your compensation for your work in this case will be somewhere in the range of slightly over 30,000.

Does that sound about right?

A.  Yes, since I started.

Q.  You've made somewhere in the range between $25,000 and $35,000 per case, right?

A.  Something like that, yeah.

Q.  So as Mr. Furr just demonstrated with you, it's fair to say that there were things in the record that you reviewed that, for whatever reason, you chose not to share with the jury, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, I didn't think it was my job to share everything I read with the jury.  I thought I was here to express an expert opinion.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Right.  So what you did is you reviewed, as you called � well, first of all, let's remind the jury.

And on issues that you were asked about,

you made a decision, based on your clinical

judgment, your professional experience, which

information was to you most credible, and you

shared that with the jury?

A.  I believe that's my job.

Q.  Right.  You did not see as your job, for example, to share with the jury, for lack of a better word, both sides of the story and then explain why you chose one or the other.

You just chose to share one side of the story, correct?

A.  I don't think that's correct, because I said that the medical records, a lot of them indicate 1975.

Q.  Right.

A.  And I didn't � I didn't pretend that the only story was that he � what his son said, that he quit when he got cancer in the 1990s.  I didn't say that.

I said the medical records � I said what the medical records say.  So I did tell both sides of the story.  I told all the sides of the

Q.  But, for example, on one of the issues that you also stressed a lot, and Mr. Furr just went through with this you briefly, that he increased the amount he smoked when he switched to filters.

You had directly contrary evidence from Mr. Shulman's deposition, which Mr. Furr just went over with you, that you did not share with the jury, correct?

Page 6104 getting enough nicotine after he switched to the

filters because he was more agitated, because he

left his son's house after ten minutes, which

disappointed his son, that he was leaving, that he

was more edgy.

I thought that he had compensation. That was my professional opinion.

Q.  My question to you was a little simpler.

My question to you is � and maybe you'11 tell the jury you just forgot about it.

My question to you is:  You had sworn testimony about whether he smoked more when he changed to filters that went directly opposite of what you told the jury and you didn't share that with them?

That's a yes or no question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Objection, Judge. It's not a yes or no question if the witness can't answer yes or no.  It was a very long question, a very long question.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It seems to me that every time you bring out one little section of the transcript, that around it, when you look at a fuller picture, when you look at all of the

Page 6105 evidence, there's evidence that changes the

meaning of that.

So when I look at the evidence around it, my opinion is based on the totality of the evidence, not one little narrow thing where he might have used the word "no."

I felt that the totality of the evidence was that he was smoking more than two packs after he switched to the filters and that he had compensation.  That was my professional opinion about that issue.

Q.   (BY MR. BRENNER)  My only question to you, sir, I'll ask it again:  Is there a sworn deposition testimony where Mr. Shulman is asked the direct question:  Did you change the amount you smoked when you switched to filters?

He said:  No.

You just went through that with

Mr. Furr

My only question to you is: You did not share that with the jury. You made that decision, correct?

A.  I figured that was your job to bring that out.

job to bring out the other parts, that's fair?

A.  No, I bring out the whole record.  I didn't think � I didn't agree with that.

I don't agree with that when I look at the whole record, so I'm not going to say something I don't agree with.

Q.  Okay.  So let's look at that particular issue because you had three sources of information.

You had the sworn testimony where Mr. Shulman said he did not increase the amount he smoked when he switched to filters.

You had the interview with Dr. Hoge where he says he did, right? That's what you relied on?

A.  Yes, that's where I got that information.

Q.  Right.  You had a third source of record � you had a third source of information, which is the medical records, right?

A.  Well, the medical records say about one pack, one-and-a-half-pack.  That's what they

say

Right

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER) In fact, the medical records are replete with Mr. Shulman reporting to his doctors how many packs a day he smoked, correct?

It's not one or two times?

A.  They're replete with it, yes.

Q.  Right.

A.  The medical records are replete with it.

Q.  Correct.  And your testimony was that before Mr. Shulman switched to filtered cigarettes, he was smoking two packs a day; that was your testimony?

A.  That was my testimony.

Q.  And after he went � started smoking way more, right?

A.  That was my reading of the material.

Q.  Right.  In the medical records, you would agree with me that the overwhelming majority

These are my opinions based on my experience, training, and knowledge of this field, This is what it looks like to me.

Q.  Right.  So in some areas, you decided that you would share with the jury certain facts but not others because, in your judgment, they weren't important ?

Q.  Okay.  So, for example � let's just give this a little context.  For example, you told the jury that Mr. Shulman switched to filtered cigarettes because he thought they were safer.

That's what you told this jury, correct?

A.  That's what they just read to the jury the other night.

Q.  You agree that Mr. Shulman gave lots of other reasons why he switched to filtered cigarettes that you did not share with the jury. Do you agree with that?

A.  His wife was talking to him for years about switching to filtered cigarettes, and she finally convinced him and he did it, to please her.

Q.  So one of the reasons he gave was to please his wife, right?

A.  She convinced him and he did it.

Q.  One of the reasons he gave was to please his wife, correct?

A.  He was trying to please his wife, yes.

A.  That may be in there.  I don't remember that, but, sure, I mean, it makes sense.

Q.  Another reason Mr. Shulman said he switched to filtered cigarettes was to try the amount � try to limit the amount of yellow stains on his fingers.

Do you remember that?

A.  Well, that's possible.

Q.  Do you remember it?

A.  I don't remember that detail.  I don't remember every detail.  There are thousands of

If not, I'll read it.  We can do it either way, sir.

Q.  Sure.  Sure.  Mr. Shulman was asked the

following question and gave the following answer.

QUESTION:  So your reason for switching to filters was you were hoping that the filter would prevent your fingers and teeth from turning yellow?

ANSWER:  I did that and other reasons, several other reasons.

Right?  Did I read that correctly? A.  That's what it says. Q.  Right.  So �

A.  Sure.

Q.  And then � I'm just continuing down. Next question:  What are the several other reasons, sir?

It softened the smoke when you inhaled it.  When you smoke a cigarette, there's just a hint of bitterness or something when you smoke, not enough to irritate you, but it was there.

And I figured that the filter would take out that too, and I smoked, and the filter was really attractive.

Did I read that correctly? A.  Yes, you did.

Q.  Okay.  So Mr. Shulman gave several reasons why he switched to filters.  We've just gone through the ones in addition to the ones you had shared before, correct? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Another thing you told the jury about filtered cigarettes was that some folks wanted to quit but then filtered cigarettes came out and that kept them smoking.

Do you remember you said that? A.  I did say that. Q.  Okay.  That's not true for Mr. Shulman,

A.  Mr. Shulman wanted to quit from when he

was a teenager.  He always wanted to quit.  He

always intended to quit, but his addiction

prevented him from quitting.

He always � he always wanted to quit.

That was clear from the beginning.  His son said

it all along.  It's just clear.  It's clear

throughout the record.

Q.  At the time Mr. Shulman switched to

filtered cigarettes, it was his intent to keep

smoking, correct?

A.  He was trying � he didn't believe he

could quit.  He didn't believe it was possible for

him, and he thought this would limit the harm.

If there was harm.  If there was harm,

because he didn't believe the Surgeon General's

first report.

Q.  Okay.

MR. BRENNER:  Let me have Dr. Seidman's

deposition, please?

May I approach, Your Honor?

He's then asked:  At that point, at that point he switched?

And then you say:  After 30 years of failing to quit, the filter was � he did see it as a kind of solution that would please his wife and in some way be better.  It was filtration, sounded like it was going to get rid of the impurities.

If there was as problem with smoking because the Surgeon General's one point of information, but there were others � you know, there might have been other inklings there could be a problem.  If there was a problem, this might be a way to solve it.

I'm not sure what the objection is.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He wants to impeach him with prior testimony, not from the depo, not from the other records, but from trial testimony in this case, which I understand he can refer to something he said during testimony.  I don't have a problem with that.

What he wants to do is he wants to make an exhibit board out of the testimony and then put it up in front of the jury, and that's just hearsay.

The record of it is hearsay.  In other words, this witness testified.  He can challenge him, he can say:  Did you say..., or:  Isn't this true...

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Well, it's �

THE COURT:  It cannot possibly be hearsay.  It's an in-court statement.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, no, but � he said it in court, but it's improper use of trial testimony.  If you take the printed version, that's just hearsay.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm sorry.

THE COURT:  Mr. Hammer has another point

to make.

(Mr. Brenner approached sidebar.)

MR. HAMMER:  Yeah, the problem is, is impeachment is the use of prior inconsistent statements.  This is trial testimony, and while counsel �

THE COURT:  It's a prior inconsistent statement at trial.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not inconsistent.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm not impeaching him with it.  I did not say �

MR. HAMMER:  Excuse me.

While � while it's perfectly proper to confront a witness with:  Well, didn't you state on direct exam... �

THE COURT:  Yeah.  Right.

MR. HAMMER:  � to show the testimony, as Mr. Schlesinger is emphasizing, is testimony out of context.

You could ask, did he say that? You can explain it, but to then show it is improper use of trial testimony.  He can use it in closing

A.
	I think so.

Q.
	And this is when you were asked about �

this is
	one of the times you were asked about �

that he
	smoked a lot more when he switched to

filtered cigarettes, right?

you:  Did he go to 2.5 packs per day?  And you

actually corrected him and said:  I don't know the

actual number, but he went to more.

It wasn't limited in any way, right?

A.  That sounds right.

Q.  Right.  Now you said � in this sentence, the word "he" is who?  Who are we talking about there?

A.  That's the � that's Mr. Shulman.

Q.  Right.

A.  Mr. Robert Shulman.

Q.  Right.  So you told the jury that Mr. Shulman said that when he switched to filtered cigarettes, he, quote, smoked "incessantly" because he couldn't get enough out of the filter, correct?

That was your testimony to the jury.

A.  Yes, that's what I believed.

Q.  Where do you get that from, sir?  You say you get it according to the report.

A.  Yes.

Q.     What  report?

A.      You   know,   this   is   a  thousand  pages.      I don't   know  where   I   got   it.      I   can   find   it,   but,

Q.  Okay.  So let's do it this way, the "incessantly" comment you're saying is as a result of switching to filters, correct?

A.  He may have said it before, too, but he's certainly saying it afterwards.

Q.  Stop for a second, Doctor.

Q.  Excuse me, Doctor.  Excuse me.  Okay?

What you communicated to this jury is that Mr. Shulman said when he switched to filtered cigarettes, he began smoking "incessantly."

That's what you told the jury? A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Okay.  We know it's not from his deposition because in his deposition he says he didn't increase the amount he smoked.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Judge. It's improper impeachment.  He wants to guote page and line of something?  I mean, I object, Your Honor.

We can � I can give the witness a computer with the transcripts and the word search function if you want to find the word "incessantly" in the record.  If that's what his debate is, I'll do that right now.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I will get to that.  Right now I'm just asking the witness to confirm for me again that in his deposition, Mr. Shulman says he did not increase the amount he smoked when he switched to filtered cigarettes.

deposit

That's argumentative and unfair to the witness.  I object and move to strike.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may I proceed?

THE COURT:  Wait.  Let me read it.

Overruled. Q.   (BY MR. BRENNER)  It is � you said it appeared several times.

The truth is there's one time in all the materials you read that this quote, "incessantly" word is used.

Do you dispute that? A.  I honestly don't know if it was used once or more.  I'm not � you know, I'm saying he may have said it for the filters.  I don't know when he said it, but it is a word that I believe he used.

Q.  Correct.  He used it to describe his overall smoking history, that he was smoking incessantly.

It has nothing to do with filtered cigarettes, correct, Doctor? A.  I don't know that.

Here, you were pretty sure it was due to

filters, but now you don't know one way or the

A.  I know that he was smoking more, that he was more agitated, that he was more anxious, that he was leaving his son's house after ten minutes and disappointing his son.

I know he was having a harder time with the filters, and I know he said he couldn't get enough from the filters, so �

Q.  Sir �

A.  That's the totality of my interpretation.

Q.  � I understand you're �

A.  Yes, go on.

Q.  Can you confirm for me that there is nowhere in this record that Mr. Shulman says what you said he said, that he started smoking incessantly because he couldn't � he felt he couldn't get enough out of the filter?

You can't point to that anywhere, can

Q.  I'm not asking for the page number.  I'm asking you to tell the jury whether it exists.

A.  I believe that he used the word "incessantly."

Q.  I believe he used the word "incessantly," too to describe his overall smoking history.

My question to you is:  Did he ever use that word to describe his smoking as a result of switching to a filter?

A.  You know what, I have to look back and see.  I'd have to really look at the � I'd have to go back and review it.

Q.  So you don't know?  As you sit here right now, you don't know?

A.  I know he used the word, and I know he had trouble with the filters.  So I'd have to go back and look at it more carefully.

Obviously, you've done � you know, looked at it minutely.

You also said when he switched to

to the report, right?  That's what you said?

A.  That is what I say according to this.

Q.  And it's different from � I'm sorry?

A.  Yes, according to this.

Q.  Again, in the totality of the record, he reports being agitated one time and one time only; isn't that correct, sir?

A.  That would surprise me if he only used that word.  He might have used other words, but...

Q.  Okay.  So let's � in the record you have, let's look at when he actually said that he was agitated and see if it has anything to do with filtered cigarettes.  Okay?

Because you're saying this is what caused his agitation, not being able to get enough nicotine out of the filter.  You were very sure at this point, right?

You told the jury that's why he said he was agitated, right?

A.  Yeah, that's my � that's my intention,

yes

May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  (Hands interview.)

Okay.  First, let's do something that I

don't � I don't think we've shared with the jury

before.

If you look at the very back of that

transcript, or the back pages, what is back there?

On the last five or six pages, what is that?

A.  Oh, these indexes are notoriously

unreliable.  I wouldn't �

Q.  Is that right, sir?  That's right?

Okay.  So the indexes report what every

word is said in the deposition, correct?

A.  Well, maybe they do.  I'm not � I'm not

in the legal field.  I'm talking about in normal

books, but, hey, if it's different here, it is.  I

don't know.

Q.  Right.  The computer takes every �

A.  I'm not a lawyer.

Q.  � word that's said and puts it into an

index, right ?

A.      I   didn't   know  that.      I'm  not   a   lawyer.

	the word "agitated," it does appear � you're

5
	
	He does say it, right?

6
	
	A.  Well, let me see.

11
	
	Q.  So let's go to Page 16, and let's see if

12
	Mr.
	Shulman's agitation, as you say, was due to

	the
	fact that he was supposedly not getting enough

	nicotine out of the filter, right?
	
15

	A.  Okay.

	for
	the jury how he describes when he's agitated.

19
	
	First of all, in this part of the depo,

20
	he was talking about when he was a younger man,
	
21
	right ?
	
22
	
	Look on the page before, he's talking

23
	about as a younger man why he started to smoke.
	
24
	
	A.  Okay.

25
	
	Q.  Okay.  So that's in the '30s or '40s, he

34?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So he's talking about what was going on with him in the '30s when there was no such thing essentially as a filtered cigarette, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And let's see what he says.  So this is what agitated Mr. Shulman.

What kind of events could you not get through without smoking?

That's the question.

ANSWER:  Social gathering where people became involved in things were beyond my comprehension, and they got me into a place where I felt left out.

I felt lost and also agitated because I didn't have the knowledge that was being discussed at the time.

And out of frustration, you know, I had to have someplace to go, and that was a cigarette.

Nothing to do with filtered cigarettes, correct?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Excuse me, Counsel. Let's just � on the same interview, on Page 39,

MR. BRENNER:  It has nothing � Your Honor, it has nothing to do with agitation.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right.

Why were you smoking Marlboros?  And because he was getting satisfaction out of cigarettes has nothing to do with this at all, right?

Your Honor, I'll show you this transcript.  This is exactly this area of interrogation, if I may, if I can.

THE COURT:  Can the parties approach, please?

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is not redirect. This is all about why was he smoking Marlboros, he couldn't get the satisfaction out of the cigarette.

This supports the witness's statement. It's the complete �

THE COURT:  What was the question?

MR. BRENNER:  My question is:  You used the term saying he was agitated all the time.

transcript?

MR. BRENNER:  I used Page six- � Page 16.

THE COURT:  Page 16.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm just using the witness's words that he said he was agitated all the time because he couldn't get nicotine out of the filter.

I asked him, the only time he talked about agitation was when he was left out at social events, 16, Line 5 to �

THE COURT:  What does that have to do with the brand of cigarettes?

MR. GDANSKI:  Marlboro is the filtered brand.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Right.  And, Judge, the page of the testimony that they still have on the board talks about agitation and smoking Marlboros because he couldn't get the satisfaction out of the cigarette, and they're trying to say that his answer is incorrect.

THE COURT:  Well, if you're done with this, you should take that down.

MR. BRENNER:  Yeah, I'll take it down.

MR. BRENNER:  Monday afternoon. May I approach? THE COURT:  Yes. Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Just so you know, this

2
	talking about, not someone else's testimony.

3
	Okay?

4
	We're on 5712.  If you feel you need to |;

	review other parts of your testimony to answer my \

6
	questions, you'll tell me that.  Okay?

7
	A.  Okay.

8
	Q.  Got it?

9
	A.  I have it in front of me.

10
	Q.  Okay.  Great.  So the first part of this ;

11
	answer is something we've already covered, your

12
	opinion that the record supports that he �

13
	Mr. Shulman increased the amount he smoked.

14
	Here you say:  He upped his smoking

15
	quite a bit.

16
	That was that opinion, right?

17
	A.  Yes.

18
	Q.  We've covered that.  I'm not going back

19
	to that.

20
	This is all in the context of what you

21
	say happened to him when he switched to filtered

22
	cigarettes.

23
	A.  Right.

24
	Q.  Just to orient you, right?

25
	A.  Right.

Page 6150 Q.  We're on the same page?

A.  That sounds correct.

Q.  And then you said:  He had to puff harder, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  That's different than smoking more cigarettes.

You're saying he did two things, he smoked more and he puffed on the ones he was smoking harder, right?

A.  I do say that.

Q.  Right.  You would agree with me, sir, that in the entire record you reviewed, whether his deposition, his medical records, or his interview, that he never said that at all; you made that up, sir?

A.  I believe that that's part of what happens when they compensate.  So I may be extrapolating from the fact that he was trying to get the nicotine out, and that's what you do when you try to get the nicotine out, you puff harder.

So I may be extrapolating from it there, but � because I believe that he had compensation �

Q.  So some smokers �

Q.  So he doesn't say he puffed harder, right?  It fact, he says the opposite.

A.  Not right there.

Q.  Okay.  Let's switch topics. On direct examination with Mr. Schlesinger, he asked you that in order for you to do what you do, meaning a clinical psychologist, that part of your practice deals with folks that have � that are trying to quit smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  As part of that practice, in order to do what you do, you need to know why it is that cigarette smoking is bad for you, correct, because you counsel them?

A.  That I need to know that?

Q.  Yeah, you counsel them.  One of the things � when you talk to people that are trying to quit smoking, you tell them both the � not as a medical doctor, but as a clinical psychologist, what can happen to them if they keep smoking, correct?

A.  Well, like, I might say:  1200 people die every day from it, something like that?

A.  I do tell them the benefits of quitting.

A.  Well, I'm trying to give people hope, and a lot of times people do much better when they quit.

Sometimes they die, too, get sick unfortunately.

Q.  Okay.  Let's switch topics.

I want to follow-up just a little bit on something Mr. Furr covered with you. First, let's get some basic facts down.

The various quit dates in play, as you said, were 1975, right?  That's one of the possibilities?

A.  One of the possibilities.

Q.  Right.  Then you have this 1985 to late '80s, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That was what you said that Mr. Shulman testified to, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And then you have 1995, right?

And that is � do you know that's when Mr. Shulman was diagnosed with bladder cancer?

A.  Right.  When he had that huge surgery.

Q.  Right.  And you said there's evidence in the record that that's when he quit, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  That's all.

And that's the end.  No one goes past that, right, that you read?

	A.  No.

	Q.  Okay.  It would be kind of silly, right?

3
	A.  Well, I � that's all � that's all I

4
	read.

5
	Q.  Okay.  So let's talk about that in the

6
	context of � this is a slide you used during your

7
	direct examination.

8
	Do you remember that?

9
	A.  Yes.                                         \

10
	Q.  And you talked a little bit about �

11
	with Mr. Furr about these over-the-counter

12
	cessation aids?

13
	A.  Right.

14
	Q.  And this is your testimony as the ways

15
	Mr. Shulman tried to quit smoking, correct?

16
	A.  Yes.                                         i

17
	Q.  And you said one of the ways he tried to

18
	quit smoking was nicotine gum?

19
	A.  Right.

20
	Q.  Okay.  So let's see if that is � and

21
	you covered with Mr. Furr Tuesday that in his

22
	deposition, he says he never used nicotine gum.

23
	So you had that information, correct?

24
	A.  Yeah, he just said:  No.

	Yeah, his deposition.

Page 6161 Q.  Okay.  Then you said that you saw other

information in the interview � by the way,

nicotine gum, another fact, comes on to anyone �

the first possibility anyone could have nicotine

gum is 1984 by prescription, right?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  And 1996, after anyone says Mr. Shulman tried to quit smoking, is when it becomes over the counter, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  And when you were confronted with the deposition testimony of Mr. Shulman saying he never used it, you said:  Well, he said it in another place.  In the interview he did.

And you were particularly struck by how he remembered what nicotine gum looked like.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So, as a trained �

A.  And he also said that he used it a dozen times within a six-month period.

Q.  Right.

A.  He was very clear about that.  And he described what it looks like, which how could anybody know.

Q.  So is there any way � and actually, the

and it had nicotine amounts, dosage amounts.

That's the only thing he described about

how it looked.

A.  I think he described the little squares, but, you know �

Q.  Do you want me to show it to you, his description of it?

A.  I'd rather keep moving, if we can.

Q.  Okay.  So is there any way that you can think of, as a trained clinical psychologist, that the someone would know, apart from using it, that � is there any way that you can come up with that someone would know that nicotine gum comes in pieces?

Is that a possibility, that someone could come to that information short of actually using it?  Can you think of anything?

A.  I mean, it's possible.  Maybe � maybe he saw somebody else using it.  I don't know.

Q.  Right.  Maybe they went to the store and saw it, right?

A.  Maybe they did, but it's in a box, you know.  And you'd have to open the box, and you'd have to look inside.  And you'd have to open it up

	MR. BRENNER:  May I approach, Your

3
	Honor?

4
	THE COURT:  Yes.

5
	Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Okay.  So let's see if

6
	you need to open the box to learn the two things

7
	Mr. Shulman said about nicotine gum.

8
	Just take a look at it and then we're

9
	going to put it up on the screen.  Okay?

10
	A.  Okay.

11
	Q.  So if one were to go to CVS or Walgreens |;

12
	without ever having used � without ever been a

13
	smoker, what would they know about nicotine gum?

14
	They would know, one, that it comes in

15
	pieces, correct, without opening the box?

16
	A.  I guess so.

17
	Q.  And they would know, two, that it comes

18
	in dosages, right?

19
	A.  I guess they might.

	Q.  Right.  Now as a clinical psychologist,

21
	you are confronted all the time �

	A.  Could you lower your voice?  You're

Q.  It's annoying you.  I apologize, Doctor.

I don't mean to annoy you.

A.  Yeah, I hope not.

Q.  Okay.  You would agree as a clinical psychologist, and as you've done � as you said in this case, you're often confronted with conflicting information from folks that you counsel, right?

A.  Well, sometimes they say they're smoking ten.  And then when you start talking to them and you learn more about it and you do follow-up questions, it turns out to be 20 or 25 or 30.

So it changes if you're really working with someone.

Q.  Right.  In this case �

A.  In this case, there was � nobody was really working with him around smoking �

Q.  I'm not even talking �

A.  � just the medical records.

Q.  I'm sorry.

I'm not talking even about smoking. Just in general, therapists, when you deal with people � for example, sometimes people remember things that didn't happen, right?

things that didn't happen for various reasons,

correct?

A.  Well, that sounds strange to me.  I'm not sure what you're referring to.  That's just kind of a weird, blank statement.

Q.  Okay.  So in this case, you were confronted with � because you didn't treat Doc � excuse me, Mr. Shulman, you were confronted with two pieces of information.

You were confronted with, one, information that he never used nicotine gum, or Nicorette gum in his deposition.  And, two, you saw him saying that he did use it in his interview with the doctor, right?

A.  I think he said he used it a dozen times.  He was very clear, and he described it.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So that seemed convincing to me.  It had the ring of truth.  I don't know.

Q.  Okay.  So let's see if it had the ring of truth.

Doctor, he � in addition to saying what it looked like and that it came in pieces, he was actually really clear about how he got it, wasn't

Mr. Shulman was describing buying nicotine gum

over the counter, correct?

A.  That's what it says right there, yeah. Q.  Okay.  We can look if you want �

A.  And I don't have any problem with that. Q.  Right.  So �

can

Q.  Sure.

A.  But why don't you say where you're going first.

Q.  So, therefore, the earliest Mr. Shulman would have used nicotine gum is 1996, correct?

A.  If it's over the counter, yeah.

Q.  Right.  And you agree it is over the counter.  I can show you where he says �

A.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No argument.  No argument.

Q.  Okay.  And your testimony was that he used nicotine gum in 1996 or later, 1996 or later, to help him quit smoking, correct?

Q.  Right.  So does it now cause you to

question your testimony that Mr. Shulman used

nicotine gum as a way to quit smoking?

A.  Not at all �

Q.  Okay.

A.  � because obviously you don't work in the field.  Can I explain?

Q.  You explained it to Mr. Furr the other day that you said years after � years after people quit, they may still use nicotine gum?

A.  Well, a lot of my patients use it for years.  Some use it for 15 or 20 years.

Q.  He didn't.  In his own words, the most he used it for was over a six-month period?

A.  Okay.  So maybe he needed it then.  He was having cravings, and he used it.

Q.  So �

A.  A lot of people use it after they quit.

Q.  So �

A.  That's fine.

Q.  Right.  So �

	That indicates that he quit in '95, and

Q.  I just thought of this.  So, anyways, is this from 1985 when it was a prescription?

that in a second.

But do you see what it says right here:

For those who smoke their first cigarette within

30 minutes of waking up?

A.  Right.

Q.  What does that sound like to you?

A.  It sounds like for people having a hard time, and that's the formula brand.  That's the strong stuff.

Q.  What � what test does that correspond to?

A.  The Fagerstrom test which everybody uses �

Q.  Right.

A.  � in the field anyway.

Q. So to determine nicotine dependence, you said the number one key consideration was whether you smoked within 30 minutes of waking up?

A.  That's the best predictor of how you're going to do a month out, a month after you quit.

How many cigarettes you smoke a day and how soon after you wake up you take your first

Q.  And so did you share with the jury on direct what you found in the record with regard to uncertainty of when and if and how Mr. Shulman used the gum?

A.  I did.  I said � you know, that he says he used it as one of the ways that he quit �

Q.  Okay.  And �

A. � or that he used it. He needed it � maybe he needed it not to relapse. I don't know why he used it.

Q.

Didn't we show that to the jury?

A.  We did.

A.  This is the third time I've ever been in a courtroom.

Well, we'd object.  Objection.

THE COURT:  Do you need to approach on the objection?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Our objection is it's beyond the scope of any cross, and it's hearsay.  He wasn't asked any questions about Huffington Post by us .

Mr. Schlesinger did it on direct, but we didn't touch it on cross.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, Judge, they extensively asked about his publications.  They cross-examined about excerpts � excerpts of his book.

I asked for rule of completeness of what other chapters there were, what other things he wrote about.  You said it would be on redirect.

This is redirect.

MR. FURR:  We need clarification from the Court.  May we approach?

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  You just ruled on this, Judge.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  It's my objection.

Your Honor, during the course of our cross, you did tell them that he could use any parts of the publication that he needed to for rule of completeness.  I don't dispute that.

That is not, however, a green light to start reading a bunch of unrelated topics, some of which are prejudicial and inflammatory potentially to certain members of the jury.  They have nothing to do with the scope of cross, and I think �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are the subject matters �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me.

I think this is improper bolstering if it's not really a rule of completeness.

Again, if there's a part that I used, and, in all fairness, if it were to create a misimpression that could have been left, then the

that.

But it's not a green light to start bolstering his testimony with publications on unrelated topics, including some that have nothing to do with Mr. Shulman, are prejudicial, prenatal women, inner city women.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  � and identify some of the key chapters that he � that he � that he published on.

THE COURT:  Even if they have nothing to do with any of this stuff?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They have everything to do with this.  The whole book is about dependence and smokers.

You told me I could put anything in context.  You just ruled that I could do this, Judge.  You just ruled that I could � we went from The Huffington Post.  He said they didn't use it.  You said I could put anything back into context any way I wanted.

This is just the beginning.  I have a bunch of this, Judge.  It's 15 minutes; I haven't asked a single question of this witness without an objection and a sidebar.

THE COURT:  Right.

sidebar, and now they're taking advantage of it.

I don't think it's fair.

THE COURT:  Well, that was as to the things that were in the depositions, not as to a book.

I think I made it very clear that I didn't think books, you know, dealt with rule of completeness issues, that that was when you impeach a witness with regard to deposition testimony.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm just showing this as �

THE COURT:  But this isn't a rule � this isn't a rule of completeness issue.  Okay?

Now there are certain things that they covered on cross-examination, and there are certain things that you're going to cover on redirect.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, please.

THE COURT:  We are not going to repeat, you know, your direct examination again �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I didn't do this on direct.

THE COURT:  So the question is, for you to go through 15 different chapters �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I won't go through all of them, Judge.  I'll just � I'll put them up. I'll go through a few.  I'll do it quick.

I would have been done and on to the next board by now.  I can do it.  Just let me have a redirect.

This is � I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for their cross.  I didn't use this in direct.

I could have used this in direct, but I didn't because I didn't think I needed it, but now on redirect, I need it because of what they brought up, so I'm putting it in context.

They're saying he took � they're saying he picked and chose.

MR. FURR:  What the Court ruled on Tuesday was �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  You just ruled I could use this, with all respect.

MR. FURR:  You know, I really don't think we should get back into interrupting each other.

interrupt him if that's what I have to do, but

what the Court ruled was that the parties could

use any portion of any document used for the rule

of completeness if they needed to.

But, of course, under the rule of completeness, the material has to be reasonably related to the portion that was shown to the jury, and it has to be reasonably necessary to create a misimpression �

THE COURT:  But you brought his book into � into � you brought his book into � into issue here.

MR. FURR:  Right, I used his book to demonstrate prior inconsistent statements, the classic rule of impeachment that is condoned by the rules of course.

That doesn't mean that I put in play every prejudicial or irrelevant cumulative statement contained in his book that has nothing to do with my cross-examination.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to � I'm going to overrule the objection.  However, it's without prejudice to you bringing up further objections as the guestions go on about things

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Just � you were

asked some questions on cross about context and

picking and choosing.

Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were also asked some questions by

counsel yesterday, Mr. Furr � actually Tuesday,

about one of your books, this Helping the

Hard-Core Smoker book, which we have here.

And you said this was to help other

people treat addicts, right?

A.  That's for doctors and clinicians.

Q.  All right.  And then the Quit Smoking,

Smoke-Free in 30 days, was designed to be a

self-help guide to �

A.  To a general audience of smokers, to be

aspirational, inspirational --

Q.  And this is, what, a 2010 book?

A.  Yes.

Q. So this kind of book wasn't available to someone like Mr. Shulman back in the '60s or '70s when he was smoking?

A.  I wasn't around to write it.

Q.  So, for instance, in Helping the Hard-Core Smoker, I know they quoted a couple things, but you've got extensive chapters in here on such � on such issues as nicotine dependence, nicotine addiction, smoking with adolescents, smoking cessation, older smokers, nicotine replacement, hard-core smokers, right, hypnosis, the den � you talked about the dental profession? You've got a lot in there for clinicians to learn about cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence, right ?

A.  Right.

Q.  And, as a matter of fact �

A.  I'm the editor of the book.  I only wrote three of the chapters.

Q. Okay. But you still have responsibility for what's in it �

A.  That's true.

Q. � because you have to read it; you have to approve it?

I'd like to show it to you now. MR. FURR:  We have to approach. (The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  So apparently � THE COURT:  Hang on.  Hang on.   Hang on.  Wait just a minute.  Mr. Schlesinger is not up here.

THE COURT:  Hang on.

Mr. Schlesinger, are you here?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, sir.

MR. FURR:  Now what he seeks to do is start putting up hearsay statements in front of the jury citing other sources other than the words of this � we don't even know if this guy � if this witness wrote this chapter.

And if it's beyond the three chapters he wrote, it shouldn't be used in any event because it's a hearsay statement by somebody else.

But not only that, he now wants to put up references that contain citations to scientific literature.  Clearly bolstering and improper.

You cannot cite scientific literature. The Court has been very clear with all the witnesses.  The witnesses � you have not allowed any witness to do that.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't � I don't know that you can use this as a demonstrative because it's got the reference to the � to the � to those things.

But you can certainly ask this witness questions about what was in his book that deals

what they raised when they asked him about the

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'll take the reference off, Judge.  I mean they showed him stuff where they took certain references off.  I don't have a problem with that.

MR. FURR:  Actually, Your Honor, what happened to the reference �

MR. BRENNER:  You stopped me from taking the reference off.  I tried to do it, and you said that he wouldn't be able to answer with the reference and, therefore, I couldn't do it.

THE COURT:  Then why are you going to put it up?

MR. FURR:  Right.  That last demonstrative �

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  So in the chapter

on nicotine dependence � let me give this to you.

I want to show you something from your

book.  Okay?

A.  Okay.  Thanks.

Q.  So, as a matter of fact, they showed you

a � Helping the Hard-Core Smoker:  A Clinician's

Guide.  We showed that.

One of the things that Mr. Furr showed

you was with regard to coffee, sex, pleasurable

activities.

Do you remember that quote?

A.  Right.

Q.  That was in the chapter called, "Habit

Versus Addiction," right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  He didn't show you that.  He didn't show

you the name of the chapter.  The chapter was

Habit Versus Addiction.

What was your conclusion, what did you

teach other doctors cigarette smoking was, a habit

or an addiction?

MR. FURR:  Can we have a clarification

as to whether this witness wrote this chapter,

Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Well, I think that could be � it sounds like a predicate objection or foundation objection?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll sustain that.  Ask him a predicate question.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Cigarette smoking, habit versus addiction, which is it?

A.  So the old model was that it was a habit.  It was � either you were � you were weak and you didn't quit or you were strong and you did quit.

And the modern view is, the scientific view is that you don't choose addiction, that something changes in your brain, that you intend to quit, you want to quit, and that thing � the addiction is the thing that gets in the way between what you want to do and the actions that you take.

That's the modern view.  So I'm making a distinction in this chapter between habit and addiction.  Addiction is the modern scientific view.  Habit alone was just a willpower view that

Q.  Okay.  And in that regard, did you explain in this chapter whether nicotine was the main pharmacological agent in cigarettes that's been shown to be a powerfully addicting drug?

A.  Everybody agrees with that.  Everybody agrees with that.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, which chapter is this so we can follow along?

When you explained how pharmacologically powerfully addictive the drug was, did you explain that for a very long time, cigarette smoking was perceived as just a habit because it didn't have debilitating, intoxicating symptoms or marked social and occupational impairments associated with the use of other drugs, such as alcohol or

A.  That's right.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain the objection.  I'll strike the last answer.  The jury should disregard it.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  Can you tell us � and you can use your sources of reference � can you tell us why you wrote for a long time that it was perceived as just a habit, please, sir?

A.  Because � because you didn't get high like from heroin.  You know, it's a more � the effects are there.  They're mood-altering.  You do it more than heroin.

You do it � if you smoke a pack a day, 200 times a day, you're changing your brain, but you don't get high in the same way as you do from alcohol and heroin, so people thought it was just a habit.

But what happened is more and more neuroscientists come in and all the authorities, every authority, every health authority in the country now believes that it's a powerfully addicting drug.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The jury should disregard the reference to any other health authorities he's referring to.

I've stricken that from the record, and the jury should disregard it.  The rest of the answer stands.

Go ahead.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  All right. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Did you also � when you're teaching, not � not the actual patient, as in the one book, but when teaching clinicians and practitioners how to help folks, did you also explain that � in your book, that folks that had had addictions to alcohol, heroin, and cigarettes found that, of all of them, the hardest one to quit was cigarettes? A.  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.

THE COURT:  The witness should not answer when an objection is pending.

THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  So, let's again, let's look at your chapter, the excerpt I gave you from the chapter to put it in context of what Mr. Furr read.

You have a chapter.  In the chapter, do you discuss the relative degree of dependence of folks that were addicted to more than one addictive drug at the same time?

A.  So a lot of the people who go into rehab for alcohol, heroin, and cocaine say that it's harder to give up the cigarettes than the drugs that they went in for.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay, what other people say.

Q.  All right.  So did you also explain in

your book, and this is the chapter we're referring

to, with regard to � part of the reason it's even

harder to quit nicotine, to get off the dependence

to nicotine than things like alcohol and heroin,

are because cigarette smoking, more than any other

addictive substance, is so pervasively

intermingled with the smoker's day-to-day

activities and behaviors?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading.

MR. FURR:  And cumulative of direct.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  In any event, did you come to conclusions that you taught other doctors to understand why nicotine is the � one of the reasons that nicotine is the hardest dependence to break?

A.  Yes, because you do it so much more.  If you smoke a pack a day, that's 200 times a day you're altering your brain chemistry.

There's no other drugs where you do it that much.  So I think that's part of why it's so heavily reinforcing, so that � I guess I'll leave it there.

Page 6202 Q.  All right.  And in the context of when

Mr. Shulman was a smoker, does it matter to you

whether he smoked from 1930 or 1934 through the

mid to late '70s as to whether or not during those

40 years he was dependent on nicotine?

In other words, if he only smoked until

'75, does that mean he wasn't dependent on the

nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Not that all.

Q.  Okay.  And if we're being conservative and you stay with 1975, based on the records grouped around the time he was diagnosed with this dangerous disease �

A.  Right.

Q.  � can you tell the jurors, assuming hypothetically that's it, was he dependent during that period of time, addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  He smoked for 40 years.  Even though he intended to quit the whole time, he didn't because of the addiction.

Q.  The � with regard to one of the � I'll just do this real quick.

A.  Right.

Q.  And, again, another four hours or so of a medical exam by the fellow they asked to talk to Mr. Shulman, right ?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And when you are treating patients, when you are interviewing or dealing with patients in your practice, do you ever have 16 hours and 800 or 1,000 pages of questions and answers about their smoking?

A.  Well, it's a completely different setting, so I don't know how to answer that.

Q.  Understood.  And so we showed some medical records in the July � in the August '95 time frame that talked about when he quit in the '70s.

Did you see anything further than those single lines in the checked box in the actual treatment about when he quit?

A. Well, one of the things that concerned me about it was there was no clinical attention about it. Nobody as saying � well, nobody was talking to him about it.

What do you mean?  What do you mean when you say "satisfying"?

So I'd light up another Marlboro to try to get back the flavors of the � whatever it was that � that I needed at that time.

Okay.

So it increased my use of cigarettes at that time.  That, I remember.

Okay.  Do you think you smoked more after you switched to filtered?

ANSWER:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  And do you think this is � is that when you went to two packs?

Again, I don't want you to �

ANSWER:  No, no.  I went to two packs long before that.

Q.  Did you try to be responsible in �

A.  I read everything, and I thought hard

about everything.

Q.  And spent a great deal of time, many,

many hours �

MR. FURR:  Mr. Schlesinger, could you

read through Line 8 on that page?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.  Sure.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Page 40, Line 6,

keep going.  Okay.  I'11 go.

Do you know how far you went?

ANSWER:  No, because, again, at that

time, I think this whole thing happened around

1960.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's it?

MR. FURR:  Thank you, sir.

A.  I did.

Q.  Okay.  Expensive, tens of thousands of dollars worth of your time working on this, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  I don't know if you � did you read any of the testimony of any of their � the witnesses that they asked questions about, Hoge? Did you ever read Dr. Hoge's testimony?

A.  I read � yes, I did.  I read his testimony.  I mean, not his testimony in the court.  I don't know anything about that.

Q.  No, he hasn't testified, which brings up a good question.

They asked you the other day about Mr. � Dr. Bernsley and whether you had been involved in � did you know that Dr. Bernsley testified?

Do you know that there's a rule called the Exclusionary Rule.  You're not allowed to read the testimony of the witnesses in court without Court's permission?

Did you know that?

A.  I don't even know who he is.

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  All right.  Do you think that but for all that smoking, he ever would have gotten sick and gotten bladder cancer, heart disease, or emphysema?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Expressing a medical opinion, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  The � on Smoke-free in 30 Days, Page 4, there is a section there I want to show from � that wasn't shown when Mr. Furr was examining you.

You � you had said:  This approach isn't based on willpower, motivation, or luck. Instead, it involves knowledge, effort, and commitment.

Smoking addiction has many ways of holding you in its grip.  I will show you how to stay one step ahead of this monster and outsmart

Is that right?

A.  Yes, that's correct.

Q.  That's like the same page or the next page from what Mr. Furr was reading to you?

A.  I guess it is.

Q.  So the � are you trying to sensitize your patients to take this addiction very seriously?

A.  Right.  That's a big part of my job.  I have to � I have to get people to understand that this is a serious problem, that this is not � this isn't just you decide to do it and you can do it.  It's not like that.

The addiction is a powerful force that interferes with their ability to implement their own wishes, what they want to do.

And they need to work at it like you would work at anything that � you know, long-term that you might have to work at to try to be successful.

And we all know that when you try to do something, it doesn't mean you can do it.  There's a lot of things in life we want to do that we can't do.

Page 6211 Q.  Okay.  And then we talked about nicotine

gum.  And I guess we all raced out to the

drugstores to buy nicotine gum.

Mr. Brenner bought � he wouldn't � he's Philip Morris.  He can't buy his competitors' brand, but Reynolds has a gum, Zonnic, and so we bought a box of the Zonnic Mr. Furr talked about.

There's a package insert in the Zonnic. This is the Reynolds' product.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor. Excuse me.

The witness � I was precluded from asking the witness questions about the product because he said he didn't know anything about it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He asked extensively about the product, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Approach.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Do you have the transcript? We'll get you the transcript, Your Honor.  I remember this very thoroughly.

THE COURT:  I don't remember the testimony about this.

direct examination �

THE COURT:  I think the witness said he

didn't know much about it

MR. FURR:  What's that?

THE COURT:  I think the witness said he didn't know much about it.

MR. FURR:  He said he didn't know anything about the product.

MR. GDANSKI:  And then what happened is Mr. Furr � and then after he said:  I don't know anything about it, Mr. Furr said:  Okay.  I'd like to you assume hypothetically, and then went into a whole string of guestions.

And then he was able to answer the guestions.  And then Mr. Furr stepped in when the witness started to talk about certain � you know, other things.  So that's what happened.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  There was a point where Your Honor truncated exam �

THE COURT:  It may be subject � it may be a proper subject of redirect based on the hypothetical.  That's why I want to just look at the hypothetical.

MR. FURR:  Here's the hypothetical right here, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not the point.

THE COURT: No, he was allowed to answer the hypothetical.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

THE COURT:  And then what's your question?

MR. SCHLESINGER: I just want to ask him about the internal package insert of this very one that says that smoking is an addiction.

THE COURT:  Well, you can � because it's related to cross on the hypothetical, you may ask, but you need to ask him a predicate question.

If he's not familiar with the packaging and he's not familiar with it, he may not be able to answer it.

So since you're going to ask him another hypothetical, you may have to ask him a hypothetical because you've got to first establish that he's familiar with these instructions.

If he's never opened up a box, he's not going to be familiar with it.

MR. GDANSKI:  So we'll just ask a

nicotine gum.

MR. BRENNER:  Please the Court, may I

proceed?

THE COURT:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  All right.  So we

were talking about the nicotine gum.

And you said you use nicotine

replacement products extensively, right?

A.  I do.

Q.  And you use dual therapy, multiple

therapy?

A.  I use it very aggressively.  It's called

combination therapy, right.

Q.  Right.  And so you've got patches and

gum?

Q.  Sniffers, lozenges, nowadays all kinds

of stuff, right?

A.  Right.

Q. So you're familiar with the drug and its indications for usage and all the Physicians Desk Reference required documentation, aren't you?

A.  I believe I am.

Q.  All right.  So when Reynolds says: Because smoking is an addiction �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, that's not the question he's permitted to ask, Your Honor.

You asked him to lay a predicate as to whether he knows anything.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He just laid a predicate.

MR. FURR:  No, sir, not about this product because the witness's sworn testimony yesterday was that he knows nothing about this product.

THE COURT:  Yeah, I'm going to sustain the objection.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  Assume hypothetically that Reynolds' package insert on Zonnic specifically says to plan ahead because

Page 6216 smoking is an addiction.

Would that be in comporting with the language you see in all of these nicotine replacement products, that folks are advised that they're using a drug to help them get off of smoking which is an addiction?

A.  That's what the science shows now. There's no � there's no debate about it now, that it's an addiction.

It's not like 1994 where they could get up and say:  This isn't an addiction.  Everybody knew that wasn't true then.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor. This is far beyond the scope of what the question was .

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You can finish. A.  They told everybody it was an addiction.

They knew it � this is 20 years ago, and it's still an addiction and there's more and more research coming out every day.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, I need to approach, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.  I've got a Binger objection.

MR. FURR:  The witness just launched into a diatribe about what the tobacco companies knew and what they didn't tell everybody.

Here was his answer during his deposition where he says:  I'm not here to do that.  I'm not an expert on what they knew or didn't know.

So I have a Binger objection.

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain it, and I'm going to strike it from the record.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

THE COURT:  All right.  The objection has been sustained and the answer the witness has just given is stricken from the record and the jury should disregard it.

Ask your next question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Why don't you also assume hypothetically that they say:  Smoking is addictive in two ways.  Your need for nicotine has become both physical and mental.  You must overcome both addictions to stop smoking.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, objection.  This was a hypothetical question, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. FURR:  Since the witness knows nothing about the product.

Q. (BY MR. SCHLESINGER) If they have a gum hypothetically where they put in the package that smoking is an addiction, Mr. Furr asked you about the warning labels on cigarettes.

Have you ever seen any warning labels on any of his client's cigarettes that say smoking is an addiction to this day, 2015?

ANSWER:  I don't remember what my thoughts were.  All I do remember is that I needed a cigarette.

QUESTION:  And you would smoke?

ANSWER:  Yes.

QUESTION:  But when I asked � I mean the question I initially asked was:  Did you ever smoke in a situation that was dangerous, and you immediately said:  Yes, and you immediately said: This is an example.  So �

ANSWER:  Smoking in bed, yeah.

QUESTION:  Yeah.  So from what you've described to me, you're a very careful person, so I'm a little surprised that you would intentionally smoke in a dangerous situation. That's my first reaction, frankly.

ANSWER:  Well, you shouldn't be surprised at it because of the way my brain works. If I had a desire � not a desire.  If I had � if I needed something, I would do it.

It wasn't my intention, but I needed a cigarette.  My addiction, okay, got the better of

examination?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you see the examiner.  Does it sound

like what a doctor does with a patient, or does it

sound like a lawyer cross-examining my client?

Is that how you interact with your

patients?

A.  Well, no, not at all.

Q.  Do you bore down to that granular level

of detail, like the Eagles song where they say:

The lawyer dwells on small details?

Is that how you go after a patient?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  In any event, do

you bore down to that level of detail and

Page 6229 than the cigarette.  They experience quitting as a

boxing match between smoking and nonsmoking.

But willpower plays a role in self-control.  Success in quitting is not simply about being a weak or a strong person.

After all, many strong, disciplined people have been defeated in their efforts to quit.  Yul Brynner, John Wayne tried to quit many times.  So quitting can't just be about being strong or trying harder.

Let's look at this problem in another way.  Can you imagine telling someone who doesn't know how to swim to just jump in the water and be strong or try harder, or someone who doesn't play the piano or read music to just be strong and perform what to them are incomprehensible notes on a page?

How you approach the problem of quitting smoking makes all the difference.  If you rely on willpower alone, you may end up feeling even more powerless than when you started.

The harder you try to buy time by stalling and delaying taking a smoke, the more you start to feel like a stripped gear that can't get traction.

Page 6230 The overall reliance on willpower and

being strong can actually backfire.  Many smokers

who use ineffective methods to quit eventually

give up.

They may avoid any talk of quitting and

take on a bunker mentality.  Many suffer a loss of

confidence, begin to feel helpless, and start to

believe they are just not strong enough to quit.

Strangely enough, this myth then becomes

one of the greatest obstacles to trying new

approaches to quit successfully.

But this is � this is the party opponent, which you could use � they could use for any purpose, the party opponent, but I don't know that you can use it.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  In redirect I can, and I'm just asking for a little leeway, and I'm not � I'm almost done with this witness, Judge. I have very little left to do.  This is important.

THE COURT:  So this is what they want to

use

MR.   FURR:      It's   hearsay.      It's

If you'd let me do it, this is going to be over very soon.  I'm just trying to � a little context is fair in redirect.  It's fair, and they used an awful lot of testimony, and I tried to do redirect.

THE COURT:  Why are you not able to tell me what you're using this for?  I don't understand.

MR. GDANSKI:  We are, Judge.  They cross-examined Dr. Seidman on the fact that Mr. Shulman was exposed to messages that smoking was bad, was smoking despite that people were warning him.

His wife was telling him to quit smoking all the time. She was nagging him to quit smoking all the time.

This puts it all into context.  This puts everything into context.  We tried to put it into context on cross-examination.  We were told to do it on redirect.

The reason we can't isolate and identify for you the specific pages and lines from cross is twofold.

Page 6241 A.  I think early on it was about kind of

the aesthetics, like that he smelled and his hands

were all yellow.

And she didn't like it in her eyes and she couldn't breathe around it.  It was more of those kinds of health issues, or aesthetic issues.

And later on, you know, she was scared about what she was reading, and then I think every- � you know, people started to know more about what it did.

Q.  Okay.  And, by the way, did you see in the testimony that right after he left Winthrop, whenever that was, he moved directly down to Lighthouse, Florida, Lighthouse Point, Florida?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.  Beyond the scope of cross.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They asked about that.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Did you see that? I mean I know you weren't, you know, focused on where he lived at a given time, but did you notice that he moved to Florida?

A.  I really wasn't focused on his real estate transactions.  I was trying to deal with

Q.  And then besides what he got from his family as to why he shouldn't smoke, whether it was a dirty habit, eventually that they said: See, it's dangerous, things like that, was he also being reassured by messages from the tobacco companies reassuring him that it was unknown, unproven filters were healthier and safer?  Did he describe that extensively throughout his testimony and throughout the medical examination?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Cumulative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  You may answer.

A.  He felt that it was a solution to the problem, that he didn't think he could guit, that this was a way to express his wish to be safe, his wish to be safer, that if there was a problem with the product, that this was a way to be safe.

And filters made a lot of sense.  They seemed to make a lot of sense to him at the time, and I think we read it at the end of Tuesday what he said about it, that he thought it was a safer alternative to a regular cigarette.

Q.  Do filters still seem to make a lot of

So they just played a portion saying that he relied on statements that were made.  I'd like to show 739, Lines 4 through 25, demonstrating that he did not hear any statements from those entities.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's really outside the scope.  That is not rule of completeness, and, Judge �

THE COURT:  Well, he did.  He did talk about � he did say that he was relying upon what the tobacco industry said.

MR. GDANSKI:  Company.  That's different than the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  I mean he said the companies.  He didn't say the spokespeople, agencies.

THE COURT:  When you � when Mr. Shulman testifies, you can clarify that.

THE COURT:  All right.  The first question from the juror is � a juror is:  If nicotine and smoking cigarettes is the addictive component so much so that it has been said if there was no nicotine in cigarettes no one would smoke, why is nicotine replacement gum, et cetera, one of your recommendations to your patients for trying to kick the habit?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No problem.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ready for questions by the jury.

Okay.  These are some questions the jurors have for you.  If you can answer them as asked.

QUESTIONS FROM THE JURY

THE COURT:  If, as the doctor says, Mr. Shulman thought he was buying fun or enjoyment, why would he have to try to cut back when times were economically hard?

THE WITNESS:  I think he was trying to have fun with his friends and belong with his friends, like teenagers want to affiliate with other kids and prove themselves and be manly.

And he forced himself to smoke, and the fun part was really kind of getting out there with the kids.

And I think they were expensive, and it was the Depression years, and so the family was what he � he took some from the family.

The family had a store, and he took some, and the parents got mad because he took � you know, they needed it.  They were short on food.

Page 6261 It's hard for us to remember what the

Depression was like.  I don't remember.

But so I think it was � he wanted to be in with the kids.  He wanted to be in with the cool, popular kids and prove himself, and that was the fun part really.

And the smoking was what he had to do to kind of � like a right of initiation.

THE COURT: Okay. Next question: Why would he or the doctor said ask a doctor when he was just 16 for help quitting smoking?

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I think that's an amazing thing.  He was 16, and he was already troubled by the fact that he wanted to quit because it was � it was a problem at school.  It was a problem for him, and it was against the rules.

And he couldn't do it already, and so he went to the doctor � the doctor came to his house.  It's called a house call.

We don't have them anymore really, unfortunately.  We used to � I had them.  When I was a kid, the doctor would come to the house.

And the doctor came to his house for something else, and he said:  Hey, by the way, can

Page 6262 you help me with this?  I don't know what to do.

I can't � I don't know how to stop it.

And the doctor said:  I don't know anything about that.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Then why would he need to change to filters if it was just fun?  Why worry about safer with filters?

THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it was � and this is an important point, because it was fun to get in with the kids when he was a teenager.

But I think � and teenagers get more of the reward, more of the fun from the nicotine and less of the withdrawal.

But once you get addicted, you're really just trying to get rid of withdrawal, and what feels good is you're just trying to feel normal

agarn

So later on � this is � this is �

this is 1970.  So he started in 1934, and this is already in 1970.

All this news was coming out about how dangerous it was, and so he was worried.  The family was worried.

And the filters seemed like an answer,

Page 6263 like a way to get out of the problem that the

cigarette might hurt his health.

He didn't believe the cigarettes � remember, he didn't believe the cigarettes, that they would sell them if they weren't healthy.

He never believed that until, you know, much later; but the filters were like a hedge, like something you do just in case, you know, it's a problem, filter.

THE COURT:  Okay.  If nicotine in smoking cigarettes is the addictive components so much so that it has been said if there was no nicotine in cigarettes no one will smoke, why is nicotine replacement gum, et cetera, one of your recommendations to your patients for trying to kick the habit?

THE WITNESS:  That's a great question.

Because when you smoke a drug, it goes really fast into your brain, and the nicotine itself hasn't been shown to cause the cancer.

It's the thing that � the 69 chemicals in the cigarette cause the cancer.  The nicotine itself just keeps you coming back for more.  It keeps you buying the cigarettes and smoking the cigarettes.

	Vaping has nicotine.  That's what
	
nicot

	is .
	Vaping is nicotine, and it doesn't

have

read,
	it
	just
	has a few.


	
	In the flavors, it causes other problems
	
in your

	but, you know, not as bad as a

cigarett

cause
	cancer.
		


	
	That's � that's a lot of things to
	
cause

		and the vaping doesn't have all 69

of th
	em.

The nicotine addicts you? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Is the nicotine what's addictive? A.  Yeah.

THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

I've just sustained an objection for leading.  The jury should disregard the last question that the witness gave.  I've stricken it.

Q.   (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  What is the addictive component in the cigarette when the cigarette is being burned and inhaled?  What is the addictive component?

A.  The nicotine.  People wouldn't smoke it without the nicotine.

A.  I've read a lot about them.

Q.  Have you � have you tried to comprehensively study what makes up the vaping products on the market?

A.  I've been reading everything I can about them, yes.

Q. Aren't you aware that there are many, many, many brands of vaping on the market that contain no nicotine?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No nicotine? THE WITNESS:  You know, one of the problems is there's 400 grams of vaping, and they're saying that what it's labeled doesn't correspond to what's in it because there's no regulation.  There's absolutely no regulation.

So some of them say they don't have it, and they do have it.  Some of them say they have it, and they don't have it.

It's a mess because there's 400 brands. So it's a complicated guestion you're asking.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  But aren't you aware that there are many brands of vaping on the market that contain no nicotine?

A.  They're saying that they don't � there's no guality control.  That's my answer.

MR. FURR:  Yes, exactly, beyond the scope is right.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They asked about vaping.  He tried to say that there is no nicotine in vaping, but his company sells VUs, and they advertise in Florida.

THE COURT:  I believe he's already answered it.  The question was:  The doctor says, the doctor says, not Reynolds says, the doctor says no one would smoke without nicotine.  How does he explain vaping?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Vaping has nicotine.

THE COURT:  Vaping has nothing to do with Reynolds' products.  Okay.  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  That actually comes from Reynolds.
