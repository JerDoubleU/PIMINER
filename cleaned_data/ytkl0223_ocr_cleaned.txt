Court
	is now
	in session.  The Honorable Judge
	
Edwar

	THE
	COURT:
	Okay.  Good morning.  Sorry

about
	the dele
	ay.
	


	Any
	issues
	before I bring in the jury?


	MR.
	FURR:
	Yes, there's one we might

take
	up, Your
	Honor.
	Plaintiffs shared with us �


	THE
	COURT:
	I was cringing, hoping that

you were goin<

	no.


	MR.
	GDANSKI
	:  I was going to say no.


	THE

	What's the issue?


	MR.

	They showed us their

demonstrative

	What's the � is it

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=5
Page 2882 something that can be quickly resolved now?  Is it

something the jury cannot see?

MR. FURR:  Yes, it is something the jury cannot see.

THE COURT:  Okay.  What's the issue?

MR. GDANSKI:  With all the demonstratives then?

MR. FURR:  No, just the ones we object to.

MR. GDANSKI:  All the demonstratives you object to, you want to do them now?

I think that's a poor use of time.  What we propose doing is if we have � we're going to use a demonstrative, we're going to put it on their computer screen first.

If it's one they object to, then we can come and approach, because I'm not going to show a demonstrative for � it's ten to 10.  We're going to break at 11:30, right?

So I'm not getting into the meat of demonstratives certainly until after 11:30.

MR. FURR:  So that means we'll have a sidebar every time one comes up.

MR. GDANSKI:  Inevitably that's what's going to take place.  Whatever Your Honor

pgNbr=6
Page 2883 prefers.

THE COURT:  All right.  Do you know what � can you tell them which ones are the issues so they don't put it up?

MR. FURR:  I did last night.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So don't put those up until we've had a chance to have a sidebar on it.

And then today's extended lunch will be used for you guys to work through those as best you can.

This is � does this hold a charge if I disconnect it for a little while?

COURT REPORTER PAULSEN:  It's fully charged.  It should just go until at least lunch.

THE COURT: Right. So if I disconnect this, it will keep working so I can use this for my phone?

COURT REPORTER PAULSEN: Yes, and I can also give you a splitter during lunch so that you can have both in.

THE COURT:  Well, I only need this for a little while.

COURT REPORTER PAULSEN: Okay. It will go a half day at least.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.
	
MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, what we're going to
	
do is, when we put up a demonstrat
	.ive, I'm going

to put it on their screen.  If the
	>re ' s an

objection, we can have that heard
	should this

occur before 11:30.  Is that okay?
	

MR. FURR:  I thought you just told us to
	
wait, not to do it this morning, t
	.0 wait till

lunch.
	

THE COURT:  If you're going to use it
	
earlier, then you'll have a sidebar on it.  And
	
don't put it up until we've had a
	sidebar, okay?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, of course.
	
THE COURT:  All right.
	Bring them in.

THE BAILIFF:  Jury entering.

Let's proceed.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Proctor.

A.  Good morning.

Q.  How are you today?

A.  I'm doing pretty good.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=9
Page 2886

Q.  Pretty good.  All right.

Tell us, please, tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, where are you from and what you do for a living.

A.  I'm from California where I'm professor of the history of science at Stanford University, where I'm also professor by courtesy of pulmonary and critical care medicine.

Q.  And you mentioned just now that you're a professor of the history of science.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Well, what is that?  What is the history of science?

A.  It's part history more generally, except we look at changing ideas of health, of disease, of cosmology, of physics, chemistry.

It can be any scientific idea or any idea about the history of the body, the history of the universe, changing ideas over time, both in the scientific community and the population more generally.

Q.  Have you, as a professor and a student of the history of science, studied the history of disease and what causes and what leads to disease?

A.  I have.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=10
Page 2887

Q.  Have you specifically done that and looked at, over the course of your career, the tobacco companies and how they've caused disease?

A.  I have.

Q.  How many years have you examined how these companies cause disease?

A. Well, I began looking at tobacco in the 1970s, but a closer focus on the industry in the last 20 years or so.

Q.  Tell us, where were you yesterday?

A.  Yesterday I was in Sacramento, California.  I was presenting a lecture to 500 tobacco control advocates from all over the State of California.

Q.  What were you doing there?  In other words �

A.  I was �

Q.  � a professor of the history of science, what are you doing at a lecture to � on tobacco control?

A.  I was invited to give the keynote address, the main sort of plenary lecture for the whole group of people because I'm an expert in that area.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=11
Page 2 Q.  Okay.  So what is that?  And what is tobacco control?

A.  Tobacco control is a name that we give to the public health effort to make people healthier, principally by limiting tobacco use and tobacco production.

Q.  And as part of the tobacco control movement, is there an effort to end the tobacco epidemic?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So why is that something you're involved in?  Why is that something you deal with, trying to end the tobacco epidemic?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Because cigarettes are the leading cause of death in the United States and actually throughout the world.  And this is obviously a substantial problem.

Over 500,000 Americans die every year from cigarettes.  So it's something lots of public health people are engaged in exploring.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  And have you done that for a number of years? A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=12
Page 2889 Q.  Let's back up a little bit.  And right now, do you have an appointment at Stanford?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is it?

A.  Well, I'm professor of the history of science, and I mentioned the medical school appointment as well.

Q.  What do you have to do at the medical school?  Are you a medical doctor?

A.  No.

Q.  So what are you doing at the medical school?

A.  Well, I occasionally give lectures in the medical school.  I publish a lot in medical journals.

It's an honorary title I have for recognition of the substantial contributions I've made to the field of medicine.

Q.  Do you publish in scientific journals?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And over the course of your career, we'll get into some of the details of it, but have you published articles, not about the history of the tobacco industry and what they've done, but about the actual product they make, the actual

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=13
Page 2890 cigarette, how it's created, how it's manufactured, how it's designed?

A.  I do both of those.  It's really not either/or.  I look at how we got to where we are, how the modern cigarette that we have came into being.

So the history is a way to inform our actual understanding of what the cigarette is, how it's designed, how it's not designed, the limits of its design, the effects of alternative designs, things like that, all of which are informed by history because history is sort of how we came to be where we are.

And so it's relevant to think topics like cigarette design.

Q.  So why, why when you need to examine and explain to individuals in California or the federal government or jurors, why is it important to understand cigarette design, the makeup of the cigarette when it comes to understanding the epidemic that cigarettes have caused?

A.  Because the world that is, is not the world that has to be.  The modern cigarette is a result of certain decisions made by the manufacturers.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=14
Page 2891 And the cigarette is unnecessarily

dangerous, in my view, and there are ways it could

have been made that would have been � killed a

lot fewer people.

Q.  You have a Ph.D.?

A.  Yes.

Q.  From where?

A.  From Harvard University.

Q.  What is a Ph.D.?

A. It's a doctorate of philosophy. It's the highest academic degree you can get in the general fields of arts and sciences.

Q.  And you got that from Harvard in 1984?

A.  That's right.

Q. All right. And you have an M.S. from Harvard �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � a master's in science?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That's from Harvard, 1977, the history of science?

A.  Yes.

Q. And you have a bachelor's degree from Indiana University in 1976 in biology?

A.  That's right.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=15
Page 2892 Q.  As part of your Ph.D., did you have to do a thesis?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was that about?

A.  It was about the ethics of science, the ideals of advocacy and objectivity in science, looking mainly at German social and economic theory, a treatise about what it means to have ethical practice in science.

And what is the interaction of that?  I mean, when it comes to the subjects of your study, be it the history of science or the tobacco industry, do you examine it through the prism of what is appropriate ethically �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � when it comes to science?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why?

A.  Well, because there are different ways to do science.  There are ways that involve, more or less, compromise, ethical compromise, and there are ways that are more honest.

And so I'm very interested in the ethical or the unethical practice of science in different cultures throughout the world.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=16
Page 2893 Q.  Have you also examined, as part of your examination of the tobacco industry, the ways in which they manipulated the scientific community?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So why did you do that?  How did that intersect?

A.  Well, because the tobacco industry has been one of the major funders of science.  And they have influenced science profoundly, pushed it in certain directions rather than others.

And you can't really understand the history of science, basic biology, chemistry, medicine without understanding the enormous influence that the industry has had on what is studied, and more importantly, what is not studied.

Q.  And just in following up on that, why? Why when it comes to the industry and the way they manipulated science, do you have to not just look at what was studied but also make sure you look at what was avoided and what was not studied?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Why?

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=17
Page 2894 Sustained as to leading.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Why when it comes to

the tobacco industry, do you look at what subjects

were avoided to be studied scientifically?

A.  Because you can't understand, for example, how the war on cancer that's developed over the last 50 years has been fought without understanding the enormous power of the industry in making certain topics ignored.

Cigarettes cause about a third of all cancers in the United States, and yet tobacco has been a trivial part of the war on cancer because of the enormous power of the tobacco industry in the United States.

Q.  Have you had to, over the course of your research and your career, examined the impact of the powerful nature that this industry has?

A.  Yes, that's �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and argumentative.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained as to leading.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Is this a powerful industry?

A.  It's an enormously powerful industry.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=18
Page 2895 Q.  Did they yield that power and have influence?

A.  They did, yes.

Q.  You � I have a copy of your CV here, so we're going to go through it a little bit.

Last year, you were the Henry King Stanford Distinguished Professor at the University of Miami?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And in 2003, you were the John Simon Guggenheim � you had the John Simon Guggenheim award of a fellowship?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were a Fulbright scholar?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is that?

A.  It's a grant that's given to you to pursue a scholarly activity.  If you're a European, you could come to the United States. If you're in the United States, you could go to Europe or you could go to other parts of the world.

It gives you a year of study with funding.

Q.  Have you received grants?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=19
Page 2896 A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So what does that mean?  What is

that process, and what does it mean for you to

receive a grant?  Is it just money to fund?

A.  It is.  You apply for it to do a particular project, and you can apply to the Rockefeller Foundation or the Wilson Foundation or the Mellon Foundation or the National Institutes of Health.

They will peer review your application, and if they find it worthy, they'll fund it.

Q.  Have you received grants from the National Institute of Health?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You had a grant from the National Center for Human Genome Research �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � as part of the National Institute of Health?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Before you taught at Stanford, where did you teach?

A.  I taught originally at Harvard University, a course on astrophysics and cosmology.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=20
Page 2897 Then I taught a course for several

years.  I was in the biology department as an

instructor.  Then I briefly taught at Virginia

Polytechnic in Blacksburg.

And then I went to Penn State University

for about 14 years.  And then since 2004, I've

been at Stanford.

Q.  At Harvard, you taught astrophysics?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's that?

A.  The origins of the universe, different theories of that, how they've changed over time, introduction to relativity, things like that.

Q.  And you were at Penn State from around '93 to 2004?  Sound about right?

A.  A little bit earlier than that, right.

Q.  Okay.  At Stanford, what type of courses do you teach?

A.  I teach several courses.  I've taught a course on human origins.  I teach tobacco and health and world history.

I teach the history of ignorance.  I teach science in the making, a freshman seminar on science, a number of others.

Q.  Tobacco and health and world history,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=21
Page 289: what's that course like?  What's it about?  What do students learn?

A.  That's an undergraduate and a graduate course, and sometimes postdocs as well.

It's a seminar based on the internal documents of the tobacco industry that are now available for public scrutiny.  They used to not be available.

It's an intensive research seminar where each student does an original project based on these formerly secret documents.

Q.  Are you � are the subject matters that you teach in your history of tobacco and health and world history, are those subject matters the same ones, in truncated form, that you're prepared to share with the jury in this case?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Could you spend a whole semester teaching this jury about what this industry did?

A.  Yes, if they were at Stanford, that's what we would do.

Q.  And they'd get college credit for it, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Ph.D. students, though, you said, you

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=22
Page 2899 have Ph.D. students who are receiving their

doctorate in the subject of tobacco and world

history?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And why is that?  Why in the world of academia, so I'm trying to study a subject matter from an academic perspective, why is studying the tobacco industry something that's done and continues to be done?

A.  Well, it's still a big deal.  I mentioned that it's the leading cause of death and remains that today.

There are interesting, complex historical factors that led to the rise and fall of the cigarette.

And those are worth studying because it's important to study what we live from and what we die from.

Q.  You just used the term "the rise and fall of the cigarette."

Currently today, cigarettes remain the number one leading cause of death in this country?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is there still currently, today, a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=23
Page 2900 tobacco epidemic in this country?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR: Mr. Gdanski is supposed to be qualifying the witness now. I take it that's what he's doing.

He keeps asking him to provide expert opinions on things, like leading cause of death, current epidemic today.

First of all, it's not history.  It's not based on history.  It's being asked to provide pure opinion testimony about what's going on today.

It has nothing to do with the issues in this case given that Mr. Shulman stopped smoking 40 years ago.

And he should not � he should stop trying to slip in expert opinion which this doctor is not qualified to provide.

I don't want to have to stop and voir dire him on whether he's a scientist or not. I mean the Court was very clear in the pretrial

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=24
Page 2901 rulings that he is to talk from a historical

perspective and not offer opinions on science

issues.

THE COURT:  I mean, it does appear that you're entering into the area of asking him to opine on things, and that is different than providing historical perspective.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, Dr. Proctor is an expert witness who can opine on things based on his historical perspective.  That's what experts do; they give opinions.

He is not merely here to recite what took place historically.  He's not a puppet.  I mean he's not just some mere historian.

THE COURT:  What was my ruling on this before?

MR. GDANSKI:  Your ruling was nothing close to what Mr. Furr is representing it to be.

THE COURT:  Let me see what it is.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's no ruling on this issue.

THE COURT:  Hand me that ruling.

MR. GDANSKI:  There is no ruling, as far as I'm aware, that touches on this issue.

MR. EDSON:  Well, it's as to design.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=25
Page 2902 He's not supposed to testify as to design.

MR. GDANSKI: I'm not talking about design. That's not � I mean, Judge, I don't understand what the objection is.

Dr. Proctor is allowed to contextualize what's going on.  This is a case where there's a claim for punitive damages.  Punitive damages includes the current conduct of the companies, what's going on today.

History doesn't exist in a vacuum. History didn't stop when Mr. Shulman started or stopped smoking or when Mr. Furr wants it to stop.

THE COURT:  Did you find the order?

MR. GDANSKI:  There is no order.  There is no order.

MR. FURR:  The order dealt with the defendants' motion to preclude Dr. Proctor from providing expert testimony on cigarette design.

MR. GDANSKI:  The question was �

MR. FURR:  I haven't finished, Jon.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

THE COURT:  Really you have been doing this now for two days where you don't let the other lawyers finish and you interrupt them.  I'm

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=26
Page 2903 going to ask you not to do that again.

MR. FURR:  And the Court granted that motion and said that the plaintiffs had to approach you and proffer the expert testimony of cigarette design that they wanted to elicit from Dr. Proctor before doing so in the presence of the jury.

But underlying that motion was that he is a historian, not a scientist.  And the thrust of that motion was to keep him from coming here and providing expert testimony just like he is now.

The current � the current morbidity and mortality rates has nothing to do with his historical stuff.

MR. GDANSKI:  So there is no order. I've done nothing wrong.  There's no basis for the objection.

And I'm asking him the state of the current affairs as it relates to the subject matter of this case where there's a claim for punitive damages.  There's a claim for reprehensible conduct.

Mitigation is a defense that the defendants have.  History doesn't stop at moments

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=27
Page 2904 in time.  It continues on.  That's an essential

part of Dr. Proctor.

THE COURT:  Laying history is one thing. He's providing opinions about his �

MR. GDANSKI:  His review.

THE COURT:  � his editorial perspectives on it.  And I'm not sure that he's been qualified to properly provide that.

So that's the concern that the defendant has .

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll qualify it.

THE COURT:  So what's the current objection?

MR. FURR:  The objection is beyond the scope he's qualified �

THE COURT:  What was the question?

MR. GDANSKI:  The question was:  Is there still a cigarette epidemic?

I mean, if nobody � if anybody knows about that in this country, it's this man.  He was �

THE COURT:  What does that mean, "cigarette epidemic"?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll have him define it.

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=28
Page 2905 objection.  Ask the next question.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, what does the term "cigarette epidemic" mean?

A.  An epidemic is a common disease, a disease that is common.  It means literally above people, something involving many people, not just one person.

Q.  And as it relates to the historical and current cigarette epidemic, have you published on that?

A.  Extensively, yes.

Q.  Have you lectured on that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you written about that in peer-reviewed journals?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  New York Times editorials?

A.  I have.

Q.  Books, have you written books?  I mean, we'11 get into it, but have you written actual books dedicated to the subject of the historical and current trends as it relates to the cigarette epidemic?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=29
Page 2906 A.  Yes.

Q.  Dr. Proctor, is there still currently,

today, a cigarette epidemic?

MR. FURR:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, as a historian, do you just examine historical facts and articulate what took place, or does a historian have a role in examining historical facts and putting them into their proper perspective and understanding in reaching a conclusion based on historical facts?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What does a historian do when they examine history?

A.  Well, the whole point of history is a kind of rescue of the past.  It's the closest thing we have to a time machine.

The idea is to walk in the shoes of the past and understand how the past has been different from the present.

That requires that you not just find isolated facts about the past, but that you weave them into a coherent narrative, a chronicle, an

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=30
Page 2907 evidence-based story that is reliable and

repeatable in some sense.

So it requires that you put the past in

context.  You don't want to just find something

about the past and misunderstand its significance

or misunderstand how it fits with other facts in

the past.

So context is crucial.

Q.  And in putting everything into context, have you come to historical conclusions, conclusions as to why certain events took place, what the impact of certain events were, just from a historical perspective like any historian would do?

A.  Of course.  That's the whole point of history is to look at the origins of things, the impacts of things, the social forces that create a present situation or an ancient situation.

Q.  And in examining the historical forces that have come together to cause the historical cigarette epidemic, did you look at the role that these defendants, the tobacco companies, played?

A.  Yes.  That's a big part of my research.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=31
Page 290 Q.  Did the tobacco companies cause and create a cigarette epidemic in this country?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What's the relationship between the hundreds of thousands, 500,000 deaths per year and the tobacco companies?

A.  Well, the tobacco industry produces the cigarettes that cause the epidemic.  That's the manufacturer.  They are the original and most important causal agent.

Q.  Would we have a tobacco epidemic in this country, a cancer epidemic caused by tobacco in this country without these companies?

A.  No.

Q.  You mentioned you teach a course called history of ignorance?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what's that about?  Why are you teaching about the history of ignorance?

A.  Because there's a lot more ignorance in the world than there is knowledge.

Philosophers have tended to study what we know when it's also very important and interesting to study what we don't know.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=32
Page 2909 Why are certain things not known?  What

has been forgotten in the past?  How is ignorance

created and maintained?

There's a whole realm that has been

forgotten, almost everything that has been known

has been forgotten.

And one can study the forces that

produce ignorance in sort of same way you can

study the forces that produce knowledge.

Q.  And do you teach specifically and have you written specifically about the subject of ignorance, the manufacture of ignorance as it relates to cigarettes and tobacco companies?

A.  Yes, in several of my books, it features prominently.

Q.  Why?

A. Well, because there's so many important things that we've forgotten, and I think this is part of history more generally.

History is the art of memory, the science of the past.  It's a way to rescue things that have been lost.

But we can also study how certain realms of ignorance have been created in concrete examples.  That's the cigarette mainly.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=33
Page 2910 Q.  And how does that intersect?  How does this history of ignorance intersect with the tobacco epidemic, the hundreds of thousands of deaths per year?

MR. FURR:  May we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yeah.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  My objection is this, Your Honor, Mr. Gdanski is asking improper, argumentative questions.  You will see that this continues all day.

He is loading � rather than simply ask the witness a question to elicit information, Mr. Gdanski loads up the question with every prejudicial fact that he can think of.

He loads tobacco epidemic, 500,000 deaths. He's done it over and over and over already.

I don't want to object every time, but I think Counselor should be instructed to stop asking argumentative questions and stop incorporating all of these facts into each question.  It's just prejudicial.

THE COURT:  This last objection � this

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=34
Page 2911 last question is � the objection is sustained.

Ask the next question.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:) Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Counselor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

MR. FURR:  Thanks. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, how does the history of ignorance intersect with the tobacco epidemic?

A.  Well, the cigarette industry has created doubt, has deliberately created ignorance in the population through many different techniques, many different methods.

"Doubt is our product" was one of their slogans inside the industry.  They were selling cigarettes, but that depended upon their ability to sell ignorance.

And they measured that; they created it; they studied it.  They became masters of the arts of creating ignorance.

And that's how it intersects, because it's really only once people understand the health effects of smoking that they really start

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=35
Page 2912 declining.

The historical decline in the epidemic

is largely the result of people understanding the

truth about the harms of cigarettes.

Q.  And you used the term "doubt is our product."

Is that your term?

A. No, it's a term from one of the internal business records of one of the companies, Brown & Williamson, from 1969.

Q.  You wrote a book called "Cancer Wars"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what's that about?

A.  It's about what causes cancer historically up through the present, looking at all the different types of things that can cause cancer, radon, asbestos, food dyes, bad air, things like that, cigarettes, occupational exposures, and so forth.

Q.  Do you have a chapter in that book called "Doubt is our Product"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Was that book translated into Russian, German, Turkish, Japanese, other languages, Czech?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=36
Page 2913 A.  Well, not just that one book.  That book

was translated into a couple, and then my other

books have been translated into those languages.

Q.  You have another book titled "Agnotology:  The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what's that about?

A. That's about the history and the ethics of ignorance. I was mentioning how ignorance is created, how it's destroyed, how it's sustained, how it's threatened.

Q. You have a book titled "Racial Hygiene," about medicine under the Germans during World War II?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And have you had an interest over the course of your career studying the history of the evolution of medicine, especially how it was used over time and with an emphasis on Germans during World War II?

A. I have. Yeah, I've written two books on that.

Q.  You wrote a book in German?

A.  I wrote another short book in German on

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=37
Page 2914 this topic.

Q.  After you graduated from Harvard, did

you have to go overseas to study?

A.  Well, I didn't have to, but I did.  I won a grant to go write a book.

Q.  Nobody has to write a book.

Did you win a grant to write a book?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And where did you go?

A.  I went to Berlin for a year.  I went to Berlin actually twice for a year.  I went to Hamburg for a year.  I've done a number of studies overseas.

Q.  Do all � I mean, how many � how many individuals in this country have written multiple books on the subject of tobacco companies and their role in history and the influence they had on smoking behaviors?

A.  That would be a handful of people actually writing multiple books on this topic.

Q.  And you have another book that you wrote a couple years ago.  We're not permitted to say the actual title of the book, but you wrote the book.

And part of the title is "Origins of the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=38
Page 2915 Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition"?

A.  Correct.

Q.  What's this book about?

A.  That's a review of the history of the cigarette, cigarette culture, cigarette advertising, the tobacco industry's secret documents.

It's a comprehensive overview of the rise and the fall of the cigarette epidemic, the various social forces that were involved, the specific defects of the cigarette and how they could have been avoided.

Q.  It's almost 600 pages?

A.  Yes, that sounds right.

Q.  And does this book deal with many, many, many of the different subject matters you're prepared to discuss with the jury?

A.  It does.

Q.  You write in this book about the history of cigarette design?

A.  I do.

Q.  Okay.  Have you looked into, with specificity, not just the history of cigarette design but the actual cigarette design?

A.  Yes, that's one of the main things I

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=39
Page 2916 research and publish on.

Q.  Are you an expert on cigarette design?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you written in peer-reviewed literature on the subject of cigarette design?

A.  Extensively.

Q.  So what does that mean for you, to write in a peer-reviewed literature on cigarette design?

A.  Peer review means that when you write an article or a book, you submit it to a journal. And then that's sent out by the editor to other experts in the field.

It might be two reviewers.  It might be ten, or it might even be twenty depending on the importance or the controversial nature of the topic.

If they judge it to be, you know, good science, good history, they will recommend that it be published, sometimes with revisions.  And that's called peer review because it's reviewed by your peers.

Q.  And for the benefit of the jury and the Court, can you explain the importance of the fact that you've actually published on cigarette design and that those publications have been cited by

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=40

	
	Page 2917

other historians and other
		scientists, for that

matter?
	
	

A.
	Well, citation is
	what you hope to

achieve,
	among other things
	>.  When you write

somethin
	g, if no one reads
	it or cites it, it's as

if you never wrote it.
		


	And there are many scientific papers
	
that no
	one reads, or at least no one cites.  So
	
it's an
	indicator of the influence of your work if
	
it is often cited.
		


	Cited just means
	other scholars include

it in th
	eir footnotes.
	

Q.
	How many times has
	; your work been cited

by other
	scholars?
	

A.
	Thousands of times
	

Q.
	And is that something that you're, of
	
course,
	proud of?
	

A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	Have you written on the chemistry of
	
cigarett
	e smoke?
	

A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	And have you done
	so in peer-reviewed

journals
	?
	

A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	Have you examined
	medical journals,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=41
Page 291 scientific publications, tobacco company documents as it relates to the chemistry of cigarette smoke?

A.  I have.

Q.  And the chemical composition of cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You've published a journal � an article in the journal Nature?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is the journal Nature?

A.  Nature is an umbrella group of journals published by the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

I published several times in Nature, but the most important one was in "Nature Reviews Cancer" in 2001.

Q.  Okay.  And what was that article about ?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Here is the technique that's being used now, Your Honor.  He's asking � it's

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=42
Page 2919 calling for � improper for hearsay.

He's asking the witness to tell him what the article was about, and the witness is going to discuss matters that he is precluded from doing so and would not be allowed to do so.

For example, on this particular article, one of the things that this witness may say is that in this article, he estimated that one billion people in the world would die by 2030 from cigarette-related deaths.

That's completely improper because, among other things, he's not a scientist qualified to do so.

But, secondly, he has retracted and backed off �

THE COURT: Well, if the article is not in evidence yet, how do get him to publish it and read it?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not asking � I'll ask him for his scientific conclusions.  I don't need to put the article into evidence.  I'm asking why this �

THE COURT: You're asking him to publish an article, which is a hearsay document.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not asking to publish

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=43
Page 2920 anything.  I asked him why �

THE COURT:  You said:  Would you read something from it, no?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, not at all.

MR. FURR:  He said:  What's it about?

MR. GDANSKI:  I said:  What's it about?

MR. FURR:  He's asking �

MR. GDANSKI:  What is an article he wrote about?  How is that not part of his qualifications?

I'm qualifying this expert on subjects. They're objecting to many, many subject matters which I've never had objections to before.

I just qualified him on cigarette design.  He's an expert on cigarette design.  He's written peer-reviewed articles on it.  I wouldn't usually have to do that.

THE COURT:  What is this one about?

MR. GDANSKI: This one is about why he's written articles in Nature and about how cigarette smoking causes injury and death.

This man is at the top of the scientific community on all of these subjects. So to suggest that this is areas �

THE COURT:  All right.  I think you can

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=44
Page 2921 qualify him without having to have him tell us

about the sub- � tell us about a hearsay document.  So I'm going to sustain the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll just ask a scientific conclusion.

MR. FURR:  Did you hear what he just said, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Well, we'll see what question he asks.  If we have to do sidebar all day long, we'll just do it.

All right.  Let's go.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor � hang on.  Sorry.

Dr. Proctor, have you examined growing trends in morbidity and mortality as it relates to cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you published on that? A.  Yes.

Q.  What does the term "morbidity" and "mortality" mean?

A.  Morbidity is sort of a fancy way to say

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=45
Page 2922 illness, and mortality is death.

Q.  And are you the first scientist in the

world to have published on what the trends will be

as it relates to morbidity and mortality of

cigarettes?

A.  No, no, of course not. Q.  Are you the first to project going forward into the 21st century?

A.  No.

Q.  What have been your findings on the subject?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  My objection is it's beyond his expertise.  He's not a scientist.  He's a historian.

He now wants to turn him into a scientific witness who is going to speculate about how many people will die in the future from smoking-related disease.

Completely beyond the scope, speculative, improper hearsay.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=46
Page 2923 MR. GDANSKI:  This man is a scientist,

and this is stuff that he's researched and

published on in peer-reviewed scientific and

medical literature.

This is not something that is outside of his expertise.  He published on this in a preeminent journal on the subject.  You won't find somebody else who has done that.

THE COURT:  You asked:  What are your findings on the subject?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes:  What are your findings?

THE COURT:  "What are your findings" is improper because he's to give us a history; he's not to give us findings.  In other words, he didn't do any tests to figure out findings.

That's an open question just to get improper opinion testimony out of him, editorial comments instead of historical information.

So you can ask him about what historical information he's aware of with regard to morbidity and those type of issues, but you cannot ask him the question you just asked him.

MR. GDANSKI:  I cannot ask him his opinions?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=47
Page 2924 THE COURT:  Sustained.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, have you done an actual analysis as to the trends in cigarette-related mortality, death, as it relates to current and future prospective information?

A.  Yes.

Q. Have you published that, that data, that conclusion you reached in a preeminent scientific peer-reviewed publication?

A.  I have.

Q.  Has that data then � has your conclusion then been cited by other scientists?

A.  Over a hundred times, yeah.

Q.  Has it been cited in Surgeon General reports?

A.  I think so.  I'm not totally sure about that.

Q.  Can you tell us what conclusion you reached on that issue?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Same question, Your Honor.  Same objection.

The COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do we know from a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=48
Page 2925 historical perspective, based on historical data, what the trends will be as far as morbidity and mortality?

A.  Yes, that's well known. Q.  Okay.  What will they be from a historical perspective?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach, Your Honor?  Same objection.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know you were waiting for me to tell you can approach. I assume it was almost automatic by now.

MR. FURR:  We get gun-shy after � Your Honor, he doesn't have a good-faith basis for believing the witness is going to get to testify to this.

You sustained it twice.  You've told him he can't provide scientific �

THE COURT:  Well, wait.  He now asked him a historical question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

THE COURT:  So he can ask him � he can ask him about, I think, historical �

MR. GDANSKI:  From a historical �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=49
Page 2926 THE COURT:  � you know, historical

morbidity numbers, for example:  What were the

number of deaths in this year or that year?

What's the study of the rate of death?

I think you can get into that kind of stuff.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's all I'm doing now.

MR. FURR:  That's not what he did though.  He asked him � he asked him:  Based on the history, can you tell us what the future will be?

He's trying to get him to speculate as to what the future is going to be.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not my � I'm sorry.

MR. FURR:  He asked an opinion about what the future will be.  It's entirely speculative.  He's not qualified to do that.  He's not asking him to describe what happened historically.  He wants the doctor �

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to sustain the objection.

Don't ask him about future trends.  Just ask him about past things.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=50
Page 2927 MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  Sure.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's got to be history.  All right?

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, we don't have so many sidebars that we need to keep it on.

THE COURT:  I almost feel like leaving it on.

MR. GDANSKI:  We can make it lower. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Anyway, Dr. Proctor, here's the point, historically, have cigarette-related deaths over the past 20 years gone down or gone up?

A.  They've gone up.

Q.  And is there any reason to suggest that that trend will not continue?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Actually, they should go down because in the United States, the peak of cigarette consumption is 1982.  And since there's a 30-year time lag between number of cigarettes smoked and death, we're actually seeing now for

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=51
Page 292 the first time a decline, the beginning of a

decline.

Globally the deaths are continuing to

increase because the epidemic is still on the rise

globally.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  Thank you. We got on a little bit of a tangent. I'll go back to something for a second.

You wrote a book more recently than the yellow book here?

A.  Yes.

Q.  This has a cover, obviously, which we took off, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It doesn't come like this?

A.  No.

Q.  You wrote a book called "Packaged Pleasures"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's that about?

A.  That's about an undiscovered technological revolution at the end of the 19th century which involved the condensation, mobilization, and democratization of sensory delights.

pgNbr=52
Page 2929 Candy bars, ice cream, soda pop are all

invented about the exact same time as a result of

what I call the tubularization of the world.

And it involves the canning of sensation

through film, photography, phonography, the

phonograph, but also the cigarette.

Many other sensations are condensed,

mobilized, mass-produced, and become widespread.

And, in a sense, it's the prehistory of

modern addictions through a technological

revolution of packaging at the end of the 19th

century.

Q.  One of the things � I mean, did you publish an article in a journal called "Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention," more recently?

A.  That sounds right, yeah.

Q.  Do you remember the names of all the articles you've written?

A.  No.

Q.  All right.  So I'm going to help you out.

"The Changing Public Image of Smoking in the United States:  1964 to 2014."

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=53
Page 2930 Q.  So why, Dr. Proctor, have you written

about the change in the perception culturally that

we have towards the cigarette over time?

A.  Well, that's very important.

Q.  Why?

A.  The whole reason for the decline of the cigarette in culture is increasing numbers of people coming to understand that cigarettes could cause them harm, posed a mortal threat.

And it's important to understand when large numbers of people in the ordinary population first understood that cigarettes could be causing death and injury.

Q.  But didn't people know forever that smoking is obviously bad?

A. No, no. Prior to the 1950s, you're more likely to smoke if you're a doctor than if you're not a doctor.

Astronauts smoked in 1960.  Four out of the seven astronauts preparing to go into space for the Mercury mission were smokers.

Whatever knowledge there had been earlier, and there was some significant knowledge, had been essentially undone by the mass-marketing of the industry and the campaign of doubt.

Page 2931 Q.  Have you heard the term, "the denormalization," "the denormalization of cigarettes"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So is that something you lecture about, you speak about?

A.  It is.

Q.  What's that concept, the denormalization of cigarettes?  What's that about?

A.  It means that we've moved into a world where you can no longer just light up a cigarette right here.  I mean, it would be illegal for me to light a cigarette.

Forty or fifty years ago, it would presumably be legal and common.  There were ashtrays on the backs of the seats in theatres. You know, doctors would smoke during a medical exam.

Presidents smoked.  Johnny Carson smoked on TV in the '70s.  So it was quite normal to smoke.

And then what happens eventually beginning especially in the 1980s, it becomes less normal to smoke.  It becomes eventually illegal in many contexts to smoke.

A.  In 2013.

Q.  Did you examine the impact that Camel cigarettes had over that 100-year period, '13 to '13?

A.  I did.

Q.  What did you find?

A.  Well, the Camel cigarettes, over that period, killed about 4 million Americans altogether.

Q.  And this was published in the Los Angeles Times, October 7, 2013?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You had an article in Tobacco Control, "Why Ban the Sale of Cigarettes?  The Case for Abolition"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Dr. Proctor, are you for the abolition of cigarettes?

A. Yes, I think they're too dangerous to be sold, and there are alternative nicotine delivery devices that are much less deadly.

So I view them as essentially horse and buggy technology that's obsolete.

A.  No.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Objection, Your Honor.  Beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection as phrased.  Re-ask a different question. MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  As a historian, have you examined historical trends in the death rates from the consumer product we call cigarettes? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Have you compared, historically, those death rates to other consumer products? A.  Yes.

Q.  Are cigarettes the number one consumer product � I'm sorry, are cigarettes the consumer product that has caused the most death and destruction historically?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained as to leading. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What product in the history of humanity, consumer product, has caused

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

the most death and destruction?
	
A.
	That would be cigarettes.

Q.
	Thank you.


	You wrote an article in the Wall Street

Journal
	called "What's in Your Cigarette?"

A.
	Right.

Q.
	Now I'd like to just back up for a

second.
	I know we touched on this, but I want to

make sure that the point is clear.
	

	As a historian, have you examined the

content

manufacture, the manipulation of cigarettes?
	
A.
	Yes, in a sense, that's the only way to

examine
	it.

Q.
	And are you an expert in cigarette

design?
	

A.
	Yes.

Q.

	MR. FURR:  Objection.  Can we approach,

Your Ho

	THE COURT:  Yeah.


	MR. GDANSKI:  I can rephrase.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=59
Page 2936 MR. FURR:  No, that's not going to solve

it, I'm afraid, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  First, Mr. Gdanski recognized the question is objectional because his motivation for why he did it is irrelevant to this case, but what Mr. Gdanski is now doing is violating the Court's order.

The Court instructed Mr. Gdanski not to put Dr. Proctor's cigarette design opinions in front of jury without approaching the Court first.

And that's what he's trying to do right now. And not only that, just because Dr. Proctor says he's an expert doesn't make him so.

Just because Dr. Proctor has read what others wrote about cigarette design doesn't make him so.

He's done nothing to become a cigarette design expert other than read book reports.  He reads what other people write, and he's perfectly qualified to come in here and say:  In such and such year, the tobacco industry wrote that if you did this to a cigarette, this would result.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=60
Page 2937 He's a historian.  That's what

historians do.  But they're trying to morph him

into somebody who can provide expert opinions on

cigarette chemistry, cigarette design, et cetera.

He's not qualified to do it, and the Court ordered

him not to do that.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, that's just � it's not accurate.  Dr. Proctor has done original research into cigarette design.

I went through exhaustively now multiple times qualifying him on cigarette design.  I'll keep doing it, but the only way for me to do it is to talk about what he's done as far as his work on cigarette design.

But I will tell Your Honor, this man has published, researched, examined, lectured, given testimony in every court that I've ever put him on with Mr. Furr on the side of our cases on cigarette design, testified in this county on cigarette design.

He went to the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and gave them a lecture on cigarette design.

The Surgeon General in 2014 has a finding that cigarettes are defective and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=61
Page 293: unreasonably dangerous by virtue of their design

citing to Dr. Proctor.

He has fascinating testimony on the subject.  He has important testimony of the subject.  He has relevant testimony on the subject.  But, by far, and certainly he has testimony on the subject, which is knowledgeable.

THE COURT:  You have to learn to do your sidebar arguments in a more succinct manner.  And when you guys give me this long monologue, it just takes so long and is just so unnecessary to resolve.

I'm going to sustain the objection. All right?  Let's go.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, on the subject of "What's in Your Cigarette?," have you examined historical documents which inform you as to what the chemical constituents in cigarettes are?

A.  Thousands of documents like that. Q.  Okay.  And in doing so, have you found that there are radioactive materials in cigarettes?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=62
Page 2939 A.  Yes.

Q.  So tell us about that, please, as it

relates to what you've published on.

A.  Well, the most important radioactive isotope in cigarette smoke is polonium-210.  It's an alpha emitter that lodges in the lungs.

And it was discovered in 1964 by two Harvard scientists, and is periodically rediscovered and forgotten and commented upon internally as one of the sleeping giants they didn't want to wake.

Q.  And have you � just to be clear on what you said, are there � is there radioactive material in cigarette smoke?

A.  Yes, it comes from the decay products of the superphosphate fertilizers used to grow the tobacco.  And it's incorporated in the leaf in Lead-210 and then decays to polonium-210.

It's part of the uranium cycle as a result of the use of the superphosphates on cigarettes.

Q.  And have you examined the historical documentary evidence as to how the polonium gets there, if you'd just explain that?

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=63
Page 2940

Q.  And have you also examined the historical evidence as to how the polonium, the radioactive material in cigarette smoke, can be removed?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What have you found?

A.  Well, I've looked at this.  My students have published on this.  There are different ways the polonium can be prevented from entering the cigarette.

You can wash the leaves in a certain way.  You can change the fertilizer.  You can change a number of the conditions of growing.

So these are all different methods that were available to the industry.

Q.  Do cigarettes sold today still have polonium-210 in them?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do they have to?

A.  No, they don't have to have as much as they do.  Any natural product will have some polonium in it, but there are different ways to manipulate it.

Q.  Have you � I mean you mentioned the term "manipulation."

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=64
Page 2941 Have you looked at, historically, the ways in which tobacco companies have manipulated cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have manipulated nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have manipulated tar and nicotine levels?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And have you published on that specific subject?

A.  Extensively.

Q.  Have you lectured on that subject?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You wrote an article � what is the FDA?

A.  That's the Food and Drug Administration, which has legal authority since 1906 over commercial foods and drugs.

Q.  I forgot to ask this last question, but on the subject of manipulation, Dr. Proctor, do the tobacco companies manipulate cigarettes?

A.  They do.  It's one of the most carefully designed small objects on the planet.  Tens of billions of dollars, with a "B," have been spent on cigarette design historically.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=65
Page 2942

Q.  Is this cigarette, this Marlboro Red from a pack from Phillip Morris cigarettes, is this the same as a tobacco leaf taken off a tree and rolled up?

A.  No, it's different.  It's a more carefully engineered product.

Q.  And have you specifically published research, lectured on that?

A.  Extensively.

Q.  Are you prepared to share some of those findings and historical facts with the jury in this case?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You have an article titled "Puffing �" an editorial "Puffing on Polonium" in The New York Times?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That deals with the same polonium we talked about?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You wrote an article titled "The Secret and Soul of Marlboro:  Philip Morris and the Origins, Spread, and Denial of Nicotine Free-Basing"?

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=66
Page 2943 Q.  And you also have a chapter in your book titled "Crack Nicotine"?

A.  Yes.  That's not the full title, but yeah.

Q.  So what type of research have you done, Dr. Proctor, on the free-basing of nicotine and how the industry did that?

A.  Well, I've done a great deal of historical research looking at the actual sequence of events that led to nicotine free-basing in the early 1960s, how it was commercialized, the role it played in the success of the Marlboro brand, how the design was reverse engineered by the competitors trying to sell more of their brands and how the technique spread throughout the industry.

Q.  Did the tobacco companies manipulate cigarettes to free-base nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do they still do that today?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Beyond the scope of historical testimony.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Historically has the tobacco industry ever stopped manipulating

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=67
Page 2944 nicotine and free-basing nicotine?

A.  No, they have arrived at certain formulas and they use those formulas.

Q.  I just want to ask you a question about history for a second.  Okay?  You know, does history stop at a moment in time?

A.  No, of course not.  We live in history, and a thousand years from now, if there are still people, they will write our history, hopefully.

Q.  And I forget the expression right now, but if you don't study history, you're doomed �

A.  Doomed to repeat it.

Q.  � doomed to repeat it, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  We must know what took place so as to prevent catastrophes from taking place again, right?

A.  Yes.  It can even be worse.  You know, it's not just, we're doomed to repeat it.  If you don't study history, you can make it worse.

Q.  You can forget it?

A.  It can be forgotten, yes.

Q.  So going back to manipulation of cigarettes and free-basing of cigarettes, does the industry � and we're going to get into the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=68
Page 2945 substance of it, but have you published on the industry's adding chemicals to cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Does the tobacco industry add ammonia to cigarettes?

A.  They do.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Sure.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, you have a specific order on this, and Mr. Gdanski has done everything he can to make sure the jury understands.  He just went through a series of questions about �

THE COURT:  They can ask that ammonia is added to cigarettes.  They can't say that the ammonia causes addiction.

MR. BRENNER:  But if you read the five questions that just led up to it �

THE COURT:  Without some more �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll lay the predicate for it, but the question that's objected to now is: Did they add ammonia to cigarettes?

MR. BRENNER:  Sure, they do, Your Honor. Your Honor has made a ruling that says to the jury:  Don't make this argument to the jury unless you get it cleared from me first.

THE COURT:  He's not making an argument at this point.  All he's doing is asking a question � right now, the only question is: Is �

MR. GDANSKI:  Do they add ammonia to cigarettes?

THE COURT:  Period.

Now what you cannot ask is � the next question should not be: Is ammonia addictive in cigarettes?  Does that increase the addiction?

MR. GDANSKI:  I know.

THE COURT:  You cannot ask that �

MR. GDANSKI:  I know.

THE COURT:  � not at this point, not unless there's been some testimony that establishes that.  Okay?

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, the last question was:  Do the tobacco companies add ammonia to cigarettes?

A.  Right.

Q.  Do they?

A.  Yeah, millions of pounds every year.

Q.  Do they add other chemicals such as urea to cigarettes?

A.  Yes, certainly.

Q.  Is there, by the way, on the side of cigarettes, is there a list of ingredients?

A.  No, there's not.

Q.  Are there for other consumer products?

A.  There are.

Q.  "Everyone Knew But No One Had Proof": Tobacco Industry Use of Medical History Expertise in U.S. Courts, you wrote that article?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And just forget the last part of the title of that article, but the idea that everyone knew, but no one has proof, what's the historical significance of that conflict?

Page 2949 MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection.

Rephrase your question.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Knowledge and proof, are those two subjects that you've looked at as it relates to the tobacco companies and their conduct and manipulations?

A.  Yes, it's crucial.

Q.  Why?

A.  Well, because who knew what, when, that's the essence of history.  Did everyone always know that cigarettes cause cancer, or was it proven at some particular point in time?

That's what a historian does, is find out who knew what, when.  How does knowledge change over time?

Q.  Are there different levels of knowledge?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And so when you talk about � I mean, the arc of a story, you know, the breadth of a story, why does understanding the different levels of knowledge become important?

A.  Well, it's important because people might know, in general, that cigarettes are bad for you, but they may not know it's the leading

Page 2950 cause of amputations, the leading cause of lung

cancer, you know, a cause of heart disease.

In other words, they may have very

general knowledge, but it may not be specific, and

it may not be very well informed.

Q.  You wrote a report, "Tobacco and Health for the United States of America" in a lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And did you testify in that case?

A.  I wrote an expert report, but I didn't testify live.

Q.  You wrote an article, "Should Medical Historians be Working for the Tobacco Industry"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You wrote an article "Nature Cancer Reviews �" in Nature, Cancer Reviews, "Tobacco and the Global Lung Cancer Epidemic."

I think we talked about that one, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  One thing we have not discussed so far is advertising.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you examined advertising and the role that it played in shaping consumer behaviors

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you have a website that deals with cigarette advertising?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Tell the jurors, please, about that.

A.  Well, we have a website.  It's called SRITA, Stanford Research Into Tobacco Advertising. It's also called "Not a Cough in a Carload."

It's a collection of over 20,000 cigarette ads, most of which are medically themed, using doctors or nurses to advertise cigarettes, and we do comparisons of then and now.

We make these available to the general public for scholarly purposes as well, high resolution reproduction.

Q.  You have television commercials as well?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And print ads?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So just backing up for a second, as a broad overview perspective, were cigarette advertisements important as it relates to increasing smoking?

A.  Yes, they've been very important

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not future, but it's the present.

MR. FURR:  Relevance. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Have you examined, not just historically, the advertisements of tobacco companies, but advertisements for the past five, seven, eight, nine, ten years? A.  I have.

Q.  Have you looked at whether some of the same themes, the same markets, the same � the same types of messages are contained in cigarette advertisements today, in perhaps different form, but in a similar way than they were in the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s?

A.  Yes, I've looked at changing themes in these ads over time.

Page 2953 Q.  I don't want to talk about it today, right now, this afternoon, but let's say over the past five, ten years, does Reynolds still advertise in popular magazines like Rolling Stone and Glamour?

A.  They do.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance.

THE COURT:  Counsel, approach. (The following discussion was held sidebar:)

THE COURT:  What's the argument as to why the last five or ten years are relevant?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because this in case, we have a claim for punitive damages.  In order to assess punitive damages, the jury can assess several things.

One is reprehensibility.  And more importantly to this analysis, they can assess whether or not they've mitigated, whether or not they've changed, whether or not they're still deserving of punishment.

One aspect, one issue, when it comes to whether they're still deserving of punishment as it relates to mitigation is, what do they do today?  Do they still deserve to be punished?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=77
Page 2954 THE COURT:  You know, now given the

disclosures that are made now, how is the last

five years, let's say, reprehensible?  What's your

argument on that?

MR. GDANSKI: The last five years are reprehensible. They're continuing to market to kids.  They're continuing to mislead the public.

They're recently cited by the FDA for having deceptive and untrue advertising that relates to organic and natural cigarettes.  They continue to do it.  Same thing.

THE COURT:  Response?

MR. FURR:  Because this is going to come up over and over, it's important for the Court to understand that the punitive damage � the causes of action that support a claim for punitive damages in the Fourth DCA under the Ciccone case are indisputably restricted to concealment and agreement to conceal.

Only conduct related to concealment or an agreement to conceal that's similar to the type of conduct that is alleged to have injured Mr. Shulman can support a reprehensibility finding.

THE COURT:  So how does advertising to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=78
Page 2955 young people that � anybody could have an opinion

that that might seem reprehensible.  How does that

go to the issue of concealment as posed?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because the advertisements conceal the true nature of cigarettes.  Just last month, his company is cited and reprimanded by the FDA for having deceptive advertisements that conceals the true nature of cigarettes.

I can guarantee you, Judge �

THE COURT:  Is this witness going to say --

MR. GDANSKI:  And he knows about that.

THE COURT:  � that the advertisements are � go to the issue of concealment?

MR. GDANSKI:  Absolutely.

And I can guarantee you, Judge, I can guarantee you that when they get their turn and they try to prove that they shouldn't be punished, it's all going to be about:  Look at us today.  We don't advertise anymore.  We don't have billboards anymore.  We don't go near schools anymore.  We don't have this � we don't have this information on our � we put this on our websites now, all of it.

THE COURT:  All right.  Response?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=79
Page 2956 MR. FURR:  Merely advertising is not

concealment.  It's affirmative fraud � it's

affirmative misrepresentation that he relied upon

it as the basis for the claim.

The fact that it's advertised and doesn't contain a disclosure of everything that Mr. Gdanski says it should, that's not concealment.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's up to the jury to decide that.

THE COURT:  What's the name of the case?

MR. FURR:  Ciccone, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I can � it's 11:25.  I can wrap up qualifications, move off this topic, and I have a memo for the Court that I can hand you in 30 seconds on this issue.

THE COURT:  All right.  So �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll move off.

THE COURT:  � let's move, and we'll take a look at your memo.  We'll look at it during the lunch break, and then go on � move on to another one.

So we'll just defer ruling on this issue.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Counsel, we can go to close

to 11:40.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  I think I have

enough to say to get us there.  We'll be okay.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, has the government of the United States, through the Office of the Surgeon General, examined cigarettes, tobacco companies, and the tobacco epidemic?

A.  Yes, not so much the companies, but the epidemic certainly, different groups who smoke, smoking behavior, things like that.

Q.  So I asked you before, I retracted the question, but what is the FDA?

A.  That's the Food and Drug Administration that was set up in 1906 to regulate food and drugs in the United States.

Q.  And does the FDA now have regulatory powers over the tobacco industry?

A.  It does in principle as of 2009 with the passage of the Tobacco Control Act.

Q.  As part of those regulatory powers over

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=81
Page 295: the tobacco industry, has there been meaningful attempts which have resulted in saving lives?

A.  Well, nothing they have done �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's beyond the scope of his expertise, Your Honor.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Have you lectured at the FDA?

A.  I've lectured at the FDA, yes. THE COURT:  I guess that was withdrawn.

MR. GDANSKI:  Withdrawn.  I'll lay out that he's �

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do you know a tremendous about the FDA's interaction with the tobacco industry?

A.  I know a fair amount about it, yes.

Q.  Have you written on it?

A.  I have.

Q.  All right.  Have you lectured on it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you actually been invited by the FDA to come to their facility to lecture on the design of cigarettes made by these companies?

A.  I have.

Q.  Is that something everybody gets invited

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=82
Page 2959 to do?

A.  No.

Q.  Going back to the question a moment ago, are you sufficiently familiar, more than sufficiently familiar to discuss the FDA, powers that it has, and what impact that it will have?

A.  I'm familiar with that, yes.

Q.  So, Dr. Proctor, has the FDA, through the regulatory power it's been granted, enacted sufficiently meaningful regulation that will result in lives being saved and injuries being avoided?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's beyond the scope of his expertise.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I will sustain the objection as --

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase. THE COURT:  � as worded.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Just describe what you understand to be the nature of the action taken thus far by the FDA and its effect.

A.  I can, yes.

Q.  Go ahead, please.

A.  Well, they have been very limited in what �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 2960 MR. FURR:  Excuse me.  May we approach?

Objection.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yep.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Relevance.  What does this have to do with any issue in the case?

MR. GDANSKI:  So are you saying, Mr. Furr, that at no point in this entire case will you ever bring up FDA as it relates to the tobacco companies and anything of the sort?

MR. FURR:  There is no relevance to what the FDA has done to any of the Phase I issues in the case.

MR. GDANSKI:  That is not true.  Phase I, Your Honor, can look at the standard instruction at the close of the case.

There will be punitive damages and whether mitigation, whether or not the way they've changed their behaviors is an important factor in entitlement to punitive damages.  I'm allowed to �

THE COURT:  It's the same issue before that you said you were going to defer on.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, this is not the same

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=84
Page 2961 issue.  This is not about conspiracy or any of

that information.

It's mitigation, and one thing that is critically important is they have not �

THE COURT:  How does mitigation come into play with regard to � is mitigation a defense to punitive damages?

MR. BRENNER:  To the amount.

MR. FURR:  To the amount in Phase II. It's not a defense in Phase I, no.

THE COURT:  How is it a defense in Phase I?

MR. GDANSKI:  I will show Your Honor the Phase I standard jury instructions that we submit will be considered by the jury.

And they are going to suggest that punitive damages are not warranted in this case despite the fact they've committed historical wrongdoings because they have changed their ways, and I'm allowed �

THE COURT:  It goes to the issue of �

MR. GDANSKI:  Entitlement.

THE COURT:  Well, it goes to the issue of the amount, right?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=85
Page 2962 THE COURT:  It doesn't go to

entitlement.

So what you're saying is you should be allowed to do it because they're going to creep it in somehow, but they shouldn't be creeping it in?

MR. GDANSKI:  This is not our first trial.

THE COURT:  So if they open the door to it, then you can get into it, but they haven't opened the door to it, right?

MR. FURR:  No, we have not, and we won't.

MR. GDANSKI:  So � okay.  I'll show Your Honor the jury instruction where I think I'm allowed to get into it affirmatively to demonstrate the fact that they haven't changed is sufficient reason for them to be punished.

THE COURT:  All right.  We will address that during the lunch break as well.

And then also � we'll defer on this one, and also, move on to another topic.

I'm assuming that you could recall this witness if they open up the door to this?

Page 2964 Dr. Proctor, back to the FDA.  What did you go

there and lecture about with specificity?

A.  Cigarette design, the fundamental defects of the cigarette, and unnecessarily creating addiction.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  These are hearsay, Your Honor.  What he said to the FDA is hearsay.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What subject matters did you, Dr. Robert Proctor, talk to the FDA about ?

A.  Cigarette design, cigarette history, tobacco industry behavior, the history of advertising, many of the things we've been talking about here.

Q.  Very good.  Thank you.

Have you also � as part of your education and learning about the subject matter that we're here to discuss, have you read books and articles by other scientists and other researchers ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You read the book "Ashes to Ashes �"

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=88
Page 2965

Q.  � "America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War �"

A.  Yes.

Q.  � "The Public Health and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's by Richard Kluger?

A.  It is.

Q.  And does that go into your fund of knowledge on the subject?

A.  It does.  It's important to obviously read what other scholars have written about this topic.

Q.  "The Cigarette Papers" by Stanton Giantz, John Slade, Lisa Bero, Peter Hanauer, and Deborah Barnes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  One of the things you had talked about and referenced earlier this morning were, I think you called them previously secret industry documents?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what are you talking about and what are these previously secret industry documents and how do you have them?  How do you know about them?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=89
Page 2966 A.  Well, these were documents that were the

internal business records of the tobacco industry

that were supplied through litigation in the 1990s

mainly.

Some of them came out a little bit

earlier through whistle-blowers, but the bulk of

them, the millions of documents came out in the

1990s and were put online as part of the Master

Settlement Agreement of 1998.

Q.  And these documents, you refer to them as previously secret.  Who was keeping them secret?

A.  Well, they were the internal records of the tobacco industry itself.  They're the company's documents.

Q.  And where are they now?

A.  They're now physically � the originals I guess would still be in the industry's archives, but copies are physically now available at various archival depositories.

Most importantly, they're online as part of the � what used to be called the Legacy Tobacco Library, is now called the Truth Tobacco Library.  So they're available online in the cloud somewhere.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=90
Page 2967 Q.  And can anybody have access to these previously secret internal documents?

A.  Yes, anyone with a computer.

Q.  How does that work?  I mean, how do you go about � as a historian, researcher, or how does any layperson go about trying to mine the previously secret documents?

A.  These have recently been scanned in using a technology called optical character recognition.

And that means you can plug in any term, any phrase, any list, string of words into these archives; and almost like a giant magnet, you can pull out those words.  Any document using those words, you'll get instantly.

Something that would have taken lifetimes, many lifetimes to do before, just going page by page, you can now do with a computer.

And it's produced an enormous increase in the speed with which you can find documents.

Q.  Does this search mechanism give you the ability to review every document from the tobacco companies' files?

A.  No.

Q.  Why not?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=91
Page 296: A.  Well, for several reasons.  Of course,

we don't have all of the documents.  Many

documents have been destroyed just in the ordinary

course of business, some under other conditions,

but also some documents remain privileged and

inaccessible due to confidentiality, usually of a

legal sort.

Q.  Have you actually looked at the manners and mechanisms in which tobacco companies shred documents?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What have you found?

A.  Well, that they're � beginning especially in the 1980s, there's a massive increase in the type of shredding that goes on, you know, originally sort of using small-scale shredding, and then techniques that involve actually the dusting, the rendering � the dust of these documents.

Q.  And have you actually examined the subject of the destruction of documents �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � from the companies' files?

A.  I have.

Q.  How many millions of pages of documents

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=92
Page 2969 have been made public to inform people of what they did?

A.  We now have � well, you qualified that "to inform people of what they did."

Q.  Forget that.

A.  These were required as a result of litigation.

This is over 80 million of pages of documents have now been supplied.

Q.  So there's 80 million pages of previously secret internal tobacco company documents?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you read every one of those 80 million?

A.  No, that would be impossible.  That would take many lifetimes.

Q.  As part of your research, though, have you searched and mined through them all to collate as much as you can on the given subject you're looking for?

A.  That's what I do, yeah, I search these documents to construct a reliable chronology of events, what actually happened in the historical record.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=93
Page 2970 Q.  Just give the jury an example.  How you do that?  If you want to investigate a subject matter, let's say it's ammonia �

A.  Right.

Q.  � how do you do it?

A.  You just plug in the word "ammonia," or some ammonia cognate, like ammonia nitrate or ammonia hydroxide, diammonium phosphate, any term you want, and you will get all documents that use that expression.

In the case of ammonia, that would be many thousands of documents.  You can then sequence them.  You push a button, and it will order them historically, in other words, which one is � view from oldest to youngest or youngest to oldest, either way.

You can order them by longest to shortest.  You can order them by author.  You can order them by many different ways.  So it's a very beautiful technique you can use to interrogate these archives.

Q.  Have you given lectures at the � internationally?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And just give the jury a flavor of where

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=94
Page 2971 you've lectured on these subjects internationally.

A. I've lectured in France and Germany at the National Cancer Institute of Germany. I've lectured to the Health Ministry in Korea.

I've lectured to the World Health Organization in the Philippines, to the National Con- � to the Global Conference on Science � on Smoking or Health in the Philippines.

I've lectured in England, Romania, countries all over the world.

Q.  And why is it important for you to bring this level of knowledge and expertise you have overseas?

A.  Well, this is a global epidemic, it's not just restricted to the United States.  And much of what used to go on in the United States is now going on all over the world, and countries all over the world have an interest in this topic.

Q.  One of the things that the jury has heard a little bit about and will surely hear about more are Surgeon General's reports. Are you familiar with those?

A.  I am.

Q.  So what are they?  How do they come out? What's the office and the mechanism by which those

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=95
Page 2972 things come out ?

A.  The Surgeon General is sort of the top medical cop in the United States.  He's head of the Public Health Service.  He has a military rank of general.

There are also surgeons general of the different branches of the military.  The Navy has a Surgeon General, but the United States Surgeon General of the Public Health Service periodically issues reports, massive reports on what is called smoking and health.

And the first of these begins in 1964, and they have appeared every year or two ever since.

Q.  And have the Surgeon General � does the Surgeon General continue to come out with reports on a biyearly basis, every other year approximately?

A.  Yes, the most recent one is 2014.

Q.  I'll get to that in one second.

I forgot, as part of your review of other books, have you reviewed "The Cigarette Century" by Allan Brandt?

A.  I have.

Q.  Who is Dr. Brandt?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=96
Page 2973 A.  Dr. Brandt is the dean of the graduate

school of arts and sciences at Harvard University

and a former colleague of mine.

Q. And it's a helpful and informative book on the subject of the 20th century and cigarette companies?

A.  It is.  It's a very important book that's won many prizes and is viewed as a standard treatise in this area.

Q.  Have your books won prizes?

A.  They have.

Q.  You've also reviewed the book by David Kessler, "A Question of Intent:  A Great American Battle With a Deadly Industry"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And who is David Kessler?

A.  David Kessler was the head of the Food and Drug Administration that I mentioned that was founded in 1906.  He was commissioner of that agency, that federal agency in the 1990s under Bill Clinton.

Q.  Going back to the Surgeon General's report, and then we'11 wrap up.

I have here, it's a yellowish golden book, "The Health Consequences of Smoking - 50

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=97
Page 2974 Years of Progress, A Report of the Surgeon General," right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So this is the 2014 report?

A.  That's part of it.  It's about � there are two other volumes of it.

Q.  And what role, tell the jury, please, what role you had in creating and finalizing this 2014 Surgeon General's report?

A.  I was a senior scientific reviewer, which means I read pretty much the whole report and provided suggestions, criticisms, comments.

Q.  Is that something that is afforded to, you know, a lot of people?

A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  Are you proud to have been asked to be a senior scientific reviewer of the most recent Surgeon General's report?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is this, in fact, the 2014 Surgeon General's report, the state of the art, most recent pronouncement on smoking from the Surgeon General?

A.  It is.

Q.  Are there � does every � does every

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=98
Page 2975 Surgeon General's report deal with the exact same issue?

A.  No.  There are thematic.  So the very first one was about lung cancer, emphysema, chronic bronchitis.

Subsequent ones dealt with women and the smoking epidemic, ethnic minorities, cigarette design, secondhand smoke, many other topics.

Q.  Have there been reports dedicated just to the subject of nicotine addiction? A.  Yes.

Q.  And have there been reports dedicated just to the subject of youth smoking and the tobacco industry's efforts to attract youth smokers?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  This is the 2012 red book, 2012's Surgeon General's report, "Preventing Tobacco Use �"

MR. FURR:  Objection.  The title is hearsay, Your Honor.  Not in evidence.

THE COURT:  I don't know that the question has been asked yet.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think that's materials that he's reviewed, the title of the book he's reviewed and relies upon.

THE COURT:  Let me see the � can counsel approach?  Let me see the book.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

THE COURT:  He's already mentioned it without objection, so I don't see any damage. This is going to be the second time he mentions it.

MR. FURR:  Dr. Proctor indicated � we don't have any white noise here.

THE COURT: You need to tell me these things.

MR. FURR: Dr. Proctor indicated that that topic had been addressed, but this precise title of this book I believe is prejudicial and it's hearsay.

And it suggests to the jury that in 2012 there still was an issue related to tobacco use among youth.  And that is not relevant.  It's hearsay.  And he should not be able to use �

THE COURT:  Okay.  It says here:  Does

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=100
Page 2977 every Surgeon General's report deal with the exact

same issue?

And he said:  It also deals with � let's see here.

Okay.  The last question was:  And have there been reports dedicated just to the subject of youth smoking and the tobacco industry's efforts to attract youth smokers?

No objection.

Yes.

MR. FURR: He's already done that. I think it's prejudicial to read the title of the 2012 report.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think that that is �

MR. FURR:  That suggests to the jury that in 2012, the Surgeon General still thought that youth smoking was an issue.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can't change the facts of what this man has reviewed or what the Surgeon General puts out.  I think it's fundamentally fair to give the title of the book.

I am eventually going to lay the predicate and seek to introduce this actual book into evidence pursuant to Your Honor's instructions.

Page 297 THE COURT:  Why don't we wait until

then, and right now just refer to it as the �

MR. GDANSKI:  The Surgeon General's

report on youth smoking?

THE COURT:  � 2012 report of the

Surgeon General.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can't say what it's

about?

THE COURT:  Not until you lay that

predicate later and get that into evidence.  Okay?

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did you review this

red book from the Surgeon General in 2012?

A.  I have reviewed that red book.

Q.  Okay.  It contributes to the information

and knowledge you have on the subject of smoking,

health?

A.  It does.  It's an important resource

like all of the Surgeon General reports.

Q.  Now one of the things that we're going

to discuss, and I want to just give a small

overview for a moment �

THE COURT:  Well, I think we're out of

pgNbr=102
Page 2979 time, Counsel.  It sound like your question is

going to be a little longer, if you're going to

give an overview.

MR. GDANSKI:  Small, but you're the boss .

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  So let's take a lunch recess now, and we will continue after the lunch break.  Don't communicate with each other about the case.

Don't communicate with anybody else about the case.  Don't use any electronic devices about the case.  Don't do any independent research.  Don't go on any social websites and comment about the case.

I'm going to want everybody back by � some time between 1:45 and 1:50. We're going to get started promptly at 2:00.  Okay?

All right.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Do you want to leave that sweater?

(Jury exited courtroom at 11:42 a  m. )

THE COURT:  Okay.  You're going to leave us a memo?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

THE COURT:  And on that other issue.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=103
Page 2980 MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir, that's the memo

discussing the � it's called harm to others, but

it deals with the post � it deals with all the

issues brought up about continuing conduct, harm

to others, Surgeon General reports.  I think it

will be informative.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  I hope it will be informative.

THE COURT:  All right.  I want you guys to use �

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, we sent an e-mail about having a conference call about jury instructions and we'll talk about the exhibits.

THE COURT:  Yeah, I'd like you guys to take, you know, maybe an hour for lunch, and then the rest of the time to actually meet and go over that and go over the issues that you anticipate this afternoon with this witness and go over those questions and see whatever you guys can work out and make sure you're clear on and particularly those demonstratives that we talked about.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  So that at least we can narrow the issues and we can have shorter sidebars

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

 THE BAILIFF:  Come to order.  Court is back in session.
 THE COURT:  Do I have to deal with any issues?
 MR. FURR:  Just one, briefly.  We did meet at lunch.
 THE COURT:  Good.
 MR. FURR:  Mr. Gdanski was good enough to forecast for us his afternoon.
 THE COURT:  Good.
 MR. FURR:  I think that we have less objections than we had.  A lot of the questions are being asked.  Nevertheless, I do want to bring one thing to the Court's attention.
 THE COURT:  Sure.
 MR. FURR:  Prior to the break Mr. Gdanski handed up to the Court a brief --
MR. GDANSKI:  That was a mistake �
 MR. FURR:  Let me finish, please, sir.
 -- a brief from the plaintiffs, Re: The Admissibility of Harm to Others.  Within that
	

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=111
Page 29� brief there is a statement about Judge Murphy

denying the defendants' motion to exclude the

Surgeon General.  As Mr. Gdanski well knows in

the very next case, the Block case, if I can

approach, I can hand it to Mr. Gdanski.

THE COURT:  Is this something you're going to give to the jury about what Judge Murphy ruled on?  Why would we give that to the jury?

MR. FURR:  No.  This was a brief given to you, Your Honor, and it contains a statement about Judge Murphy's ruling, and in the very next case �

THE COURT:  This is the amended order on it?

MR. FURR:  No, the next case, he reversed himself and he has subsequently reversed � maintained the position reflected in that order in later trials.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  Mr. Gdanski was present when that ruling was announced.

MR. GDANSKI:  The attack isn't necessary, but it's true.  The brief I handed up has an older brief that I put together quickly on the fly here.  Judge Murphy has since changed his

	FURTHER DIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GDANSKI:
	
Q
	Good afternoon, Dr. Proctor.

A
	Good afternoon.

Q
	Ready to go?

A
	Yes.

Q
	We had finished off before lunch talking

about the
	2012 Red Book, the Surgeon General's

report.  '
	rhere's another one from 2010 you're

familiar with?
	
A
	Yes.

Q
	How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease?

A
	Yes.

Q
	You've reviewed and incorporated this into

your knowledge and you've relied upon it?
	
A
	I have.

Q
	Dr. Proctor, just one of the subjects that

we're going to cover over the course of your
	
testimony
	is the interaction that the public health

community
	, the Surgeon General had with the tobacco

industry?
	

A
	Yes.

Q
	You're familiar with that subject?

A
	Yes.

pgNbr=114
Page 2991 Q    Did the tobacco industry attack the Surgeon

General?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did they do that?

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase your

question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    From a broad overview perspective, how did the tobacco industry work with the Surgeon General when it came to agreements or disagreements?

A    In every instance they criticized the Surgeon General's reports, ridiculed them, trivialized the results, said they were not based on sound science but rather basically on the views of fanatics.

Q    Are there other materials, sources that you've reviewed over the course of the years studying this subject?

A    Many.

Q    You're familiar with the book Cigarette Country:  Tobacco in American History and Politics by Susan Wagner?

A    Yes.

Q
	A Smoking Gun by Elizabeth Whelan?

	Yes.

Q

Industry Coverup?
	
A
	Yes.

Q
	Bad Acts, A Racketeering Case Against the

Tobacco
	Industry?

A
	Yes.

Q
	Doubt is Their Product:  How the Industry's

Assault
	on Science Threatens Your Health?

A
	Yes, I'm familiar with that.

Q
	Lethal But Legal:  Corporations,

A
	Yes.

Q
	After Tobacco, What Would Happen If

Americans Stopped Smoking?
	
A
	Yes.

Q
	Have you also, Dr. Proctor � following up

on that
	last title, What Would Happen If Americans

Stopped
	Smoking, have you also examined rules,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=116
Page 2993 regulations, and laws which govern the legal age to purchase cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    Have you written and studied on that subject?

A    Yes.

Q    What do we know would be the impact if the legal age was raised to purchase cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for speculation.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Let me see if I can rule on it before you approach.

Yeah, approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  What's the �

MR. FURR:  The first objection is speculation.  This � you will see a pattern of this type of question of the witness, a counterfactual pattern that he suggests to the witness, in other words, how would the world be different if the world were different?  That's purely speculation.  It's classic speculation.

What would happen if something that has not happened were to occur, how would things be different?  Purely speculation.  There is no

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=117
Page 2994 expertise in seeing the future if things were

different.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just the opposite.

THE COURT:  Definition of a historian is, history is something that happens in the past, why are we going into what would happen � all right.  How does he get to testify about what his opinion are of how things would change if there was some legislation that changed things?

And by the way, why is the legislation that doesn't exist now even relevant to this matter?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's two answers.  The first answer is, historians study the past so as to know what to do in the future and the present.  And that's not academic to the conversation.

THE COURT:  Procrast � what do you call that?

MR. GDANSKI:  Prognosticating.

THE COURT:  I'm really concerned that the Fourth DCA is going to look at this record and say that Judge Artau is letting prognosticating into the evidence.  How do I do that?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think Your Honor is letting that into evidence, especially when this

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=118
Page 2995 has been a subject that has been thoroughly

studied at the highest levels of government

calling for a raise in the minimum age.  This is

not a kooky, wacky opinion of a man on the

stand.

THE COURT:  Why would that go to the jury?

There is a piece of legislation that � the jury

is not a policy-making body here.  The

policy-making body is the legislature.  So the

objection is sustained, and do not go into these

types of questions.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  I'll do the

history of it.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, following up on that, what is

the historical significance of efforts to raise the

minimum age to purchase cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Historically as part of the story of how

the tobacco epidemic was created, is understanding

the minimum age to purchase cigarettes important?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=119

	Page 2996
	
MR. FURR:  Objection.
	Relevance.
	

THE COURT:  Overruled.
	
	

THE WITNESS:  Yes, it
	is important.
	

BY MR. GDANSKI:
	
	

Q    Why?
	
	

A    Well, most people who
	start smoking
	

historically start as teenagers,
	well over two
	-thirds

start by the age of 18.  Therefore, any legal
		bar to

young people starting will hurt
	the sale of
	

cigarettes.  There were very few
	limits on age
	

purchases in the 19 teens, '20s,
	'30s, '40s.
	Those

limits emerged after the bans ha
	d been on the
	sale of

cigarettes in certain states.
	
	

When a state � it's a
	state law, by
	the

way.  When a state requires that
	you be 21 ins
	tead

of, as most all states do, 18, i
	t limits the -
	-

MR. FURR:  Objection.
	This is beyon
	d the

scope of the question.
	
	

BY MR. GDANSKI:
	
	

Q    Historically what has
	taken place on
	the

issue?
	
	

THE COURT:  I think it
	's moot.
	

BY MR. GDANSKI:
	
	

Q    Historically what has
	taken place on
	this

issue, Doctor?

pgNbr=120
Page 2997 A   Well, the first state recently to enact a

21 age limit is Hawaii, that takes place in January.

Q    You mentioned that smoking beginning in youth, 90 percent of smoking begins in youth?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What percentage of smoking begins in youth?

A    Over two-thirds begin by 18 and 90 percent begin by the people's early 20s.

Q    Have there been studies, some of which you participated in, many of which you've reviewed, that have analyzed the impact and the relationship to lifelong smoking and prevalence of disease as it relates to starting as a youth?

A    Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have there been studies �

THE COURT:  Okay.  The objection leading

was sustained.  Rephrase your question. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have there been studies looking at the relationship between addiction and disease and youth initiation?

A    Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=121

	
	Page 2998


	Q
	What do we know about that?


	A
	Well, it's clear that the earlier you

start,
		the easier it is to become addicted.


	Q
	And historically in the scientific

community are there calls to raise the minimum age
		
from 18
		to a higher minimum age?


	
	MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for hearsay.


	
	THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY
	MR.
	GDANSKI:


	Q
	What has the public health community's

position been on raising the minimum age?
		

	
	MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for hearsay.


	
	THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY
	MR.
	GDANSKI:


	Q
	What is your position, Dr. Proctor, on

	Q
	Is youth smoking and youth initiation a

very important component of the public health crisis?
		

	A
	It is.


	Q
	Why is that?


	A
	Well, as I said, most people do begin as

Page 2999 youth �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's

cumulative, as I said, he's repeating the same

thing.

MR. GDANSKI:  Talking about the public

health crisis.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Go ahead, sir.

A    Most people do begin as youth.  If they

don't start by youth, generally they won't smoke.

That's been absolutely crucial.  It's why there is so

much emphasis put on the dangers of youth marketing

and youth targeting.

Q    If youth were not permitted to purchase

cigarettes, how would that impact morbidity and

mortality?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Speculation.  Same

question, Your Honor.  Relevance and

speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Historically speaking, we're going to get

into it, but very generally speaking, has this

industry known that the youth was an extremely

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=123
Page 3000 important component to attract as smokers?

A    Yes.  There's a long history of youth targeting, recognizing youth as a strategic opportunity, many euphemisms and code words for the youth market which they refer to as rookies, novices, new smokers, new triers, beginners, replacement smokers, there's many different terms for this crucial market that each of the companies are trying to capture.

Q    Did they successfully market to youth? A    Very successfully, yes. Q    Have they ever stopped? MR. BRENNER:  Objection.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is not his �

THE COURT:  Do you want to approach on this one?

MR. FURR:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. FURR:  Objection is relevance and beyond the scope of his expertise.  This historian � the Court has actually been very clear to Mr. Gdanski that he's here to talk about the past, not the present or future. Nonetheless, because he wants the jury to hear

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=124
Page 3001 his question, Mr. Gdanski continues asking the

witness about the current conduct of the

industry, which the Court has clearly indicated

is not the proper subject of testimony for this

historian.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor said I can't talk about the future.  Have they ever stopped marketing to youth?  Why is there a cutoff date as it relates to this industry's conduct?  When they say they changed, that's when they've changed?  Why is there some kind of �

THE COURT:  The question is, what is the � you say that goes to the issue of punitives, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I say this goes to reprehensibility, punitives, entitlement to punitives.  This is an industry that is now �

THE COURT:  Just advertising in and of itself goes to that issue or --

MR. GDANSKI:  Advertising to youth in a misleading fashion is reprehensible.  It's reprehensible conduct and �

THE COURT:  Who is going to testify that it's in a misleading fashion?

MR. GDANSKI:  This witness will.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=125
Page 3002 MR. FURR:  Judge, I don't know what they're

going to do.  But the issue is, this is not one

of the torts that supports an award of punitive

damages under Ciccone and Soffer in the Fourth

DCA.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's the conduct.  Forget the tort.  The conduct gives rise to a claim of reprehensibility.  It's not that the conduct has to give rise to the specific tort.  The conduct gives rise to a claim of reprehensibility.

This is our case, this is our proof points, and what we're trying to argue to the jury. They can't artificially say, oh, we think we've stopped doing something at a moment in time so therefore it no longer gives rise to a claim of conspiracy or fraud.  That's just an artificial defense position which they can take but it certainly can't preclude the plaintiffs from taking a different position.

THE COURT:  Margaret.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, as we discussed before, only the intentional torts can support a punitive ruling.  Reprehensibility has to be tied to the conduct that the intentional torts are based on concealment of information or

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=126
Page 3003 agreement to conceal.

THE COURT:  They want to ask if they're still continuing as of today to market to youth.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let me just frame it, though. I'm saying that the marketing to youth is done in a concealed fashion and it's continued concealment.  That's the whole point.

So even if Mr. Furr is all right, our position in the case and our evidence and our testimony is going to be that this is a continuation of a concealment, so it does go to the cause of action that Mr. Furr is saying it must go to.

I mean, we win coming and going.  I don't think that's necessary, but that certainly is true that our position is going to be that it's part of the concealment.

THE COURT:  All right.  In the Ciccone case it says that, We agree with R.J. Reynolds that the trial Court erred in allowing Ciccone to incur punitive damages on a theory of gross negligence since the cause of action was not pled in the original Engle �

We concur with the analysis of the First District in Soffer which held that Engle progeny

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=127
Page 3004 claimants can recover punitive damages only on

claims of concealment or conspiracy.

So the real question is, what is your, you know � I don't understand the conspiracy of the concealment based on whether they continue to � it appears as though you have evidence in the past of concealment of the health risks associated with tobacco smoking, and whether that was the youth marketing or other marketing.

MR. GDANSKI:  Uh-huh.

THE COURT:  Currently, day and age, what is the concealment claim?

MR. GDANSKI:  They are continuing their advertisements to conceal the truly addictive and harmful nature of cigarettes by being misleading.  The advertising is misleading.

THE COURT:  What's the misleading part � why don't you ask him this.  The predicate questions before you can get into this question is, ask him � why don't you ask him, what is the evidence, you know � does he have any historical information on concealment with regard to � whether it's youth marketing or other marketing and what is that, and did it stop at a certain time period?  Does it still go

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=128
Page 3005 on?  And then I guess, you know, you guys will

have to challenge that. MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

THE COURT:  I think until you establish that, I can't allow that. MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

THE COURT:  So I'm going to sustain the objection at this time. MR. GDANSKI:  Okay. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, rounding off the subject for now, do you have historical evidence over the course of the years that the tobacco companies advertised towards youth and marketed towards youth? A    Yes.

Q    That they concealed information as part of those endeavors?

A    Yes, I think that's fair.

Q    And is that concealment of information as part of the advertising towards youth and the � trying to attract the youth market, is that something that has ever stopped? A    No. Q    Are you prepared to discuss the ongoing

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=129
Page 3006 nature of youth marketing as it relates to the tobacco companies?

A    Yes.

Q    As part of their concealment of information?

A    Yes, I can do that.

Q    Okay.  Do they still today, does � Philip Morris, to their credit, they don't advertise in magazines anymore today, right?

A    Right.

Q    Does R.J. Reynolds still today advertise in a misleading fashion to the youth in our country?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    You're familiar with Glamour Magazine? A    I am.

Q    This edition you've seen before with the boy band One Direction on the cover?

MR. FURR:  Excuse me.  Your Honor, we need to approach.  This wasn't shown to us. THE COURT:  Okay. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.).

MR. FURR:  We asked the plaintiffs multiple

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=130
Page 3007 times to give us the image of things they were

going to use that we did not already have.

Apparently this is one of those things.  Despite

our multiple requests, they would not give us

the image so this exhibit was not disclosed, and

we object to picking up and showing things to

the jury that were not disclosed to us.

MR. GDANSKI:  It is on our exhibit list AC 352, and Mr. Furr has seen this because we used it in our last trial.  It was admitted into evidence with him as defense counsel.

THE COURT:  May I see it?  What is the document?

MR. GDANSKI:  This one even has an exhibit sticker from Broward on the front which obviously we would not put it into evidence.

THE COURT:  They're saying it was on their exhibit list.

MR. FURR:  They disclosed the number, but they would not give us an image of what they were talking about.  We have no way to know what that image is, what that number means.  We exchanged images with each other of exhibits but �

THE COURT:  I'll tell you what I'll do

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 300E then.  Well, first of all, I'm not sure how

you're going to use this.  It doesn't appear to

be an admissible document.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to show the advertisements for cigarettes.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, here is my further objection.  This magazine, I can't see the date on it.  This is a case whereas the Court now knows Mr. Shulman quit smoking in 1975.

THE COURT:  Who produces that American Spirit?  Is that R.J. Reynolds?

MR. FURR:  Santa Fe Tobacco Company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American, the parent company of R.J. Reynolds.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's true.

THE COURT:  Is it the same party in this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  RAI owns RJR.

THE COURT:  Why are you going to use an advertisement that doesn't apply to these parties?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think that they're going to do a lot of stuff as it relates to RAI in this case, so I'm talking about the same company but they are �

have responded to the Court's questions.  This

is RJ's problem, Your Honor, Mr. Shulman quit

smoking 40 years ago.  They're claiming the

concealment �

THE COURT:  He's trying to make some sort of argument or some sort of factual testimony based on his historical knowledge of where he � where he claims that he has facts that say that it's still concealment.  I don't know what that is, and that might be subject to your cross-examination as to whether it has any merit or not.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

THE COURT:  Given even the Ciccone case you guys gave me, I guess I have to let them try and make a case for it, otherwise I could get reversed for that reason.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand what you're saying.  I'll give them the magazines now.

THE COURT:  The problem is the fact that probably both parties here, whoever loses is going to think they can take this up on appeal. So I'm assuming everything I say here is going to be read by the Fourth DCA so I'm trying to

Q    You've seen documents that say high school students are the basis of the business?

A    Yes.

Q    So I'd like to start from some of the things we talked about earlier.  We gave an overview of some of the things you were going to talk about and get into the specifics, okay?

THE COURT:  If it's privilege, you need to approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Yeah, what's the basis of the privilege?

MR. GUEST:  This is an issue regarding statements by in-house counsel regarding decisions to delete certain research files from the files that the company has.  It also gives certain legal justifications for doing so.

And, Your Honor, in addition to the privilege objection, there's also issues relating to the lack of foundation that has been properly laid with respect to whether this actually happened and whether and to what extent �

THE COURT:  Is it attorney/client privilege or work product privilege?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

THE COURT:  I'm asking them, is it attorney/client privilege or work product privilege �

MR. GUEST:  That's one of the issues, Your Honor, is that it's a memo by in-house counsel

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=139
Page 3016 with respect to the issue that they're trying to

have Dr. Proctor testify �

THE COURT:  Are you claiming it's work product or attorney/client privilege?

MR. GUEST:  That's one of the objections, yes, sir.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not attorney/client privilege.  Appellate courts have looked at this document, this document and others, and have found that these documents do not have a privilege.  There have been cases reported out of Florida on this exact issue.  I don't know if this is a Riley document or not but it's certainly not privileged.  Any human being in this country �

THE COURT:  What DCA has ruled on this? Have Appellate Courts ruled on this?

MR. GDANSKI:  Outside of Florida, I think Minnesota.  It's not a Riley document �

THE COURT:  Any Florida courts rule on it?

MR. GDANSKI:  No Florida courts have specifically ever ruled on this document.  So if it's not privileged, Judge, I would point out this fact.  You can go online on your iPad right now and access this document.  If you typed in

findings of crime fraud to begin with as it

relates to these documents, but it certainly

isn't privileged.  I have it.

THE COURT:  Is that because there's a waiver?  There's been a waiver?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's a waiver.  It's on their web site.  We use it all the time in cases.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, if I may, you asked if there is an Appellate decision about this. These documents have been introduced.  And when there have been appeals, it has not been brought up as an Appellate issue by the defense, as far as the trial Court letting these documents in, there is no opinion addressing �

MR. GDANSKI:  In 100 plus trials in Florida.  And the only time these attorney/client alleged documents were ever addressed on appeal was in Minnesota.  I don't know if this one was part of Minnesota but there was a huge litigation � piece of litigation in

And the Minnesota Supreme Court or Appellate Court, but certainly an Appellate level Court found that they are absolutely not, they are subject to multiple exceptions, they were produced, used in trials across the country.  I believe this was admitted in Engle. I think this was admitted in Engle, in the Engle case.

Q    I want to orient the jury to what we're looking at because this is the first time we're putting up a documentary piece of evidence.  The jury will have this piece of paper; however, many pages are attached to it.

Dr. Proctor, do you see at the bottom right-hand side here there's some Bates numbers going down the right-hand side?

A    Yes.

Q    What are those?

A    That's a universal coding system developed through litigation that you have kind of a little machine monkey that you stamp, and each time you stamp it, it rotates the dial one point so you get a sequential number for a series of documents.  Each of the different companies had a different variety of Bates stamp, so you can often identify it by font which company it comes from.

In this case this is a Reynolds document from 1969 from Murray Sankus, the head of research of R.J. Reynolds, to the chief lawyer, Max Crohn, in the committee of counsel for R.J. Reynolds.

Q    The title is, Invalidation of Some Reports in the Research Department.  Do you see that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=147
Page 3024 A    Yes.

Q    Max Crohn is the chief lawyer?

A    Yes.

Q    It's from him or to him?

A    To him from the head of research.

Q    This is an example of a document that was obtained how?

A    Through litigation eventually.  It was made public in the 1990s.

Q    Now it's publicly available on web sites like Reynolds?

A    Ever since the '90s it's been widely available on web sites.

Q    Gotcha.

Before that, before it was publicly available for anyone to go and look at, this is private, internal, secret within the confines of Reynolds?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance. MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Before this document was compelled to be produced in litigation, is it within the confines of Reynolds?

A    It is.  It's an internal � it's from the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=148
Page 3025 files of the Reynolds company.

Q    We do not foresee any difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove certain reports from research files.  Once it becomes clear that such action is necessary with the successful defense of our present and future suits, we will promptly remove all such reports from our files. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you contextualize this for us, what's going on?

A    They're talking about lawsuits, that's what the word "suits" means in that context.  They're saying, if there's something embarrassing, they can take it out.

Q    And the bottom, As an alternative to invalidation, what does that mean?  What does that term mean, invalidation?

A    Getting rid of.

Q    We can have the authors rewrite those sections of the reports which appear objectionable. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Dr. Proctor, before we delve into hundreds of � many pages of examples, not all of the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=149
Page 3026 industry's internal records, will we ever know the true scope of what took place during the course of Reynolds and Philip Morris when they were generating internal business records? A    No.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Your question is, can your office identify by font which company it comes from?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  I'll rephrase the question.  No, sir.

THE COURT:  All right. MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, at the end of the day will we ever know the full scope of what Reynolds and the other companies, Philip Morris, Lorillard, Liggett, wrote and did internally?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did they destroy documents?

A    They did.

Q    Do we know they did?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3027 A    Yes.

Q    So with that in mind, let's start at part

of the beginning.  I don't know if a historian likes

the term "beginning," let's start back in the early

1900s, okay?

A    Sure.

Q    Cigarettes, have they always been manufactured, produced, and engineered the same way they are today?

A    No.

Q    Can you explain for us how cigarettes were made, for example, in the 1800s?

A    Prior to the 20th Century, we had the 1800s, and during that period cigarettes were rolled by hand, and they were rolled by hand by women and girls who could only roll 200 to 500 per day.

In the 1880s a machine is invented called the Bonsack machine that allowed the mass production of cigarettes 100 times faster, and instead of only 500 per day, these new machines could roll 100,000 per day.  This is the beginning of mass production of cigarettes.  It drops the price by about a factor of 10.  Cigarettes move from being a luxury to a fairly cheap consumer product.

Q    And we have some demonstrative aids

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=151
Page 302� available.  I'm going to show one titled the Flue Curing Barn, PD 2011.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay, Counsel?

MR. FURR:  No objection. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Let's go ahead and take a look at this. Dr. Proctor, can you describe what the jury is looking at here for the jury's benefit.  This is a demonstrative.

A    Tobacco is somewhat like olives in the sense that it must be cured before smoked.  There are several different ways of curing the tobacco, essentially drying it.  The most important distinction is air curing versus heat curing.  Flue curing is a type of heat curing.  The flue refers not to like having the flu.  It refers to tubes, these conduit tubes here.

What happens is you put the � you hang the tobacco in the shed, and instead of just air curing it, which produces a very harsh tobacco, if you put fire in these flues, these tubes, it heats the tobacco leaf up to a high temperature and that traps the sugar in the leaf.  It actually stops the enzymatic degradation of the sugar products that you would normally find during air curing.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=152
Page 3029 As a result you get a very sugary tobacco,

up to 20 percent sugar by weight, and it's the sugar

that when burned produces organic acids that

neutralize the nicotine alkaloids, meaning alkaline

body, and that produces for the first time a low pH

inhalable sugary tobacco that actually has to be

inhaled in order to get the nicotine.  That leads to

the modern cigarette.  The rise of flue cured, heat

cured, sugar trapping curing producing a mild

inhalable leaf of course, which causes lung disease.

Q    Let's break it down a little bit.  There is sugar curing?

A    Well, there's heat curing, which traps sugar and produces a high sugar leaf.

Q    Okay.

A    There's air curing which does not use heat and that produces a very low sugar leaf, only about 2 percent by weight.  It's that low sugar leaf that when you burn, it doesn't make acid, so it does not counteract the alkaline bodies, the alkaloids, notably nicotine but also ammonia and a number of others, and as a result you get a harsh, non-inhalable smoke.

That's the fundamental difference between a cigarette and a cigar.  A cigarette is inhaled and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=153
Page 3030 causes lung disease.  A traditional cigar is not

inhaled and does not cause lung disease.  That's the

fundamental difference between cigarettes and cigars.

Q    Historically what is the fatal flaw of

cigarettes?

A It's flue curing or more generally heat curing because there are other techniques besides flue curing that involve heat. So, for example, in the Mediterranean they � Turkish tobacco is heat cured due to the sun. They would dry the tobacco leafs on the roofs of houses, and this produced a similar heat effect, trapped sugar, and you also got a very sugary leaf as a result of Turkish.

So there are various ways you can produce an inhalable leaf, but all involve sugar, all involve trapping the sugar � sugar can even be added to air cured and you get the same effect.

Q    What's the relationship between the flue curing process and the inhalability of cigarettes?

A    Flue curing, any heat curing, anything that traps the sugar, anything that involves trapping or adding sugar, it can be done either way, that produces a mild inhalable smoke that's inhaled and it causes lung disease.  It's the key to the harm of modern tobacco.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Historically, from a history of science perspective, what's the relationship between inhalability and the change in the impact that nicotine has?

A    It was already recognized � MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Again, Your Honor, same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Does inhalability have anything to do historically with nicotine absorption? MR. FURR:  Same objection. MR. BRENNER:  Same objection. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have you reviewed these companies' documents �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Q    � historically that address the issue of

inhalability and nicotine addiction?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Rephrase your question. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do these companies have documents about the relationship between the inhalability of cigarettes and nicotine addiction? A    Yes.

Q    What do they say?

A    Well, that the lung delivery of nicotine is a more potent �

MR. FURR:  I'm sorry, I object, Your Honor. This is calling for hearsay at this point for documents that have not been admitted into evidence.

MR. GDANSKI:  Evidence � MR. FURR:  They're not in evidence. They're not identified.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Can you give us an overview of what you know, Dr. Proctor, historically from your review of the pages of these companies' files from their

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=156
Page 3033 internal documents about inhalability and nicotine addiction?

A    I certainly can.

Q    Please.  Go ahead.

A    Inhalability is linked to lung disease and addiction.  The lungs have the area of a tennis court.  The mouth has an area of the tennis ball. Anything that delivers nicotine to the lungs will produce a greater addiction.  It goes more rapidly to the brain.  It's a more effective way of dosing.

Q    We talked just now about the change in the curing method, the heating methods and � which had an impact on smoke on the pH of a cigarette, right?

A    Yes.

Q Okay. Let's move and talk about not the design but the manufacture, the machination of the process, okay?

A    All right.

Q    Describe for us how were cigarettes made in the 1800s.

A    They were rolled by hand by women and girls in small shops, sometimes bigger shops.

Q    We have a demonstrative of � just an example of some of the data and some of the imagery, a picture of a machine that was used after it was

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

MR. FURR:  Hold on.  It's not showing on our screen.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sometimes we don't need a screen.  We'll show you a piece of paper. MR. FURR:  No objection. MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. Let's go ahead and put this up, Rob, please.  Thank you. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Sir, can you describe for us the change in the mechanized process of cigarette production?

A   Well, as I said, cigarettes were rolled by hand almost entirely until the 1880s, when James Bonsack at the age of 21 modified a carding machine and made the world's first continuous process cigarette; in other words, a cigarette of infinite length.  It was then chopped by Berlin shears, and it could produce 100,000 per day.

Q    It was called the Bonsack machine? A    Yes, after James Bonsack. Q    He was the founder of American Tobacco Company?

A    No.  James Buchanan Duke founded the American Tobacco Company and got an exclusive license

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=158
Page 3035 on the Bonsack machine.

Q    So American Tobacco Company, do they exist

anymore?

A    No.

Q    And who purchased through various mergers � that don't make a difference right now, who purchased and now owns American Tobacco Company?

A    Well, this American Tobacco Company was broken up by the Sherman Antitrust Act.  It gave rise to four of the modern companies, eventually two of which were absorbed into what's now R.J. Reynolds.

Q    You've heard of the American Tobacco Company, they manufactured cigarettes in the '30s, '40s, and '50s?

A    Yes, they were the manufacturer of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

Q    And now who owns American Tobacco Company?

A    In 1994 Brown & Williamson bought the American Tobacco Company, and then in 2004, R.J. Reynolds bought Brown & Williamson and therefore the American Tobacco Company.

Q    And another company that the jury will hear about is a company called Lorillard Tobacco Company?

A    Yes.

Q    Do they exist anymore?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=159
Page 3036 A    No.

Q    Who purchased and when did they purchase

Lorillard Tobacco Company?

A    Recently, this past summer Lorillard was purchased by R.J. Reynolds.

Q    They purchased them for the Newport brand?

A    Among other things.

Q    Newport is a menthol brand of cigarettes?

A    It is.

Q    Now, it says hand rolling is 200 cigarettes a day.  Machine rolling is a hundred thousand cigarettes a day.  Current machines can make 16,400 per minute.  Do you see that?

A    Per minute, yes.  That's about 10 million per day.

Q    984,000 per hour.  You're familiar with something called � forget that.

What are the state-of-the-art machines called?  Do they look like that?

A    There are only three companies that make all of the western world's � the company GD in Bologna, Molex in London, and the Hauni machine of Hamburg is the fastest in the world.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a demonstrative with

the Hauni machine.  Any objection?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3037 MR. FURR:  No objection.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    You have a picture of this machine in this

book?

A    Yes, I do.

Q    So do the companies use these machines to make cigarettes?

A    Yes, they do.

Q    Do they have just one or multiple machines?

A    No, they have many.

Q    It's � how many cigarettes can this machine make in one hour?

A    It can make per shift � per eight-hour shift it can make � now they can make about 10 million cigarettes.

Q    What's the relationship between the number of cigarettes historically manufactured and morbidity and mortality?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Beyond the scope of

his historical testimony.  It's an expert

scientific opinion.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have you published, Dr. Proctor, on the relationship between the number of cigarettes

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=161
Page 303� historically produced and morbidity and mortality?

A    Yeah.

Q    Have you lectured on that subject?

A    Yes.

Q    Have you had publications on that subject?

A    Many.

Q    Newspapers and editorials on the subject?

A    Yes, I've written editorials, lectures.

Q    FDA lectures?

A    Yes.

Q    Have your publications on that subject been cited by other scientists?

A    Yes, hundreds of times.

Q    Do you know what the relationship is between the number of cigarettes manufactured historically and disease and death?

A    Death, yes.

Q    Are you prepared to share that with the jury?

A    Yes.

Q    What is it?

A    For about every million cigarettes in a culture you get one death 20 to 30 years later.  In other words, there's a delay effect.  It's not immediate.  The death in any society is a reflection

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=162
Page 3039 of earlier history because it takes a while for

cancers and heart disease to develop.  Generally, for

every million cigarettes, there's one death.

Q    Now, on the subject of manufacture and the inhalability of cigarettes, if cigarettes were not inhalable, would we have less disease and death? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calls for

speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do we know historically, not forward looking, what might happen in the future, but as a matter of fact that we would have less disease and death if cigarettes were noninhalable?

A    That's in the documents.

Q    Cigars, for example, do cigars cause 540,000 deaths per year?

A    No.  It's trivial.  There's no comparison in the deaths caused by cigars versus cigarettes because cigarette exposure goes into the lungs, it's more whole body.  Cigar smoke is much more confined to the mouth.  It's not inhaled typically.

Q    So typically cigars don't go down into the lungs and then rapidly spread the nicotine to the brain, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=163
Page 3040 A    Yes, because it prompts the cough reflex

because of the high pH.  It is possible to inhale

cigar smoke if you are first accustomed to lung

inhalation through cigarettes but that's unusual.

Q    Did Native Americans make tobacco in cigarettes inhalable?

A    There are some ethnographic reports of that.  We don't really know much because all the records we have are ethnographic travel literature, Lewis and Clark, that sort of thing.  We do find some examples of where things were flavored with berries and sweet juices of certain types that probably produced inhalation.  It cannot have been very common.

Q   Do you see �

A    It must have been very heterogenous because there are hundreds of different tribes and each one would have different practices, so it's a very different situation.

Q    Historically do cigarettes have to be inhalable?

A    No, they don't.  It's a design flaw.  It's a defect, not something native to the cigarette.  You can make a cigarette just as a little cigar and it will not be inhalable.

Q    If somebody takes a tobacco leaf off of a tree, doesn't do anything else to it, rolls it up and smokes it, is that the same as the tobacco found in an ordinary Marlboro or Camel?

A    No.  It's very different.  That's a highly engineered product.

Q    How much money was spent on the engineering of cigarettes?

A    Tens of billions of dollars between the '40s and the 2000s.

Q    Going back over time, are there examples in � have you reviewed newspaper articles?

A    Many.

Q    Why have you done that?  We didn't touch on that.

A    I also am interested in the history of popular culture.  The cigarette is a cultural phenomena, how it's understood popularly, misunderstood popularly, and newspapers are one source of popular culture.

Q    Have you reviewed advertisements that appeared in newspapers?

A    Yes, tens of thousands.

Q    You've reviewed magazines that appear in the popular press like Life Magazine?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=165
Page 3042 A    Yes.

Q    Newsweek, things like that?

A    Yes.

Q Would it be at all uncommon to have a Life Magazine with a Lucky Strike ad on the back?

A    No, that's very common.

Q And to have something � a picture in this case of Elizabeth Taylor on the front at the Oscar's smoking a cigarette?

A    Sure.  What year is that from?

Q    April 28, 1961.

A    Okay.

Q So we have a demonstrative. Let's take a look PDR 88. Can you explain to the jury � you're familiar with this, Dr. Proctor?

A    Yes, I am.

Q    Can you explain to the jury what we're looking at?

A    These are cigarettes from the era of patent medicine prior to the FDA when there were no regulations on what you put in food or drugs of any kind.  Tobacco was commonly used as a therapy to cure various diseases, to cure the plague or tuberculosis, things like that.  The theory was that it could � the same way that heat can sterilize medical

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=166
Page 3043 instruments or fire can cure meats, you could

actually cleanse your lungs with smoke.

In this case, this is a cigarette used to

cure asthma.  We don't even know what was in it.

Many of these had nontobacco substances, various

other types of leafs, spices.  The other ones here

are cubebs, another type of plant.  Marshall's

cigarettes.  So these are various types of cigarettes

from this patent medicine era of the late 19th

Century.

Q    Were cigarettes ever banned in this country?

A    Yes, well, the sale of cigarettes was banned �

Q    The sale of cigarettes �

A    � in 15 states.  The use of cigarettes was not banned but the sale of cigarettes was banned in 15 states from 1890 to 1927 as part of the prohibition movement or the temperance movement.

Q    What's the context?  Meaning, why are cigarettes banned at that time?  Can you explain the societal context?

A    It's part of the prohibition movement where alcohol came under attack, and there was actually an amendment to the Constitution that banned the sale of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=167
Page 3044 alcohol nationally.  One of the slogans was, Nicotine

next.  Nicotine next.  The idea being that these

reformers, these temperance advocates, these

prohibitionists would go after tobacco products, and

in 15 states they were successful.

It was a fusion of religion and science you

might say.  It was, you should not violate the temple

of the body with impurities.  And that, as I said,

led to 15 different states banning the sale of

tobacco, of cigarettes.

Q    So put into context for us, was the ban ever lifted?  Did society's view culturally on cigarettes change?  How did it adapt and change over time?

A    There were several important cultural factors.  One was the first World War where soldiers for the first time were given cigarettes as part of rations.  5 billion cigarettes were given to soldiers in the first World War.  You have the collapse of the prohibition movement by the 1920s, as a result partly of lobbying by the tobacco industry.

You have most importantly the rise of mass marketing.  It's easy to forget but there were no nationally marketed products until the late 1800s. The first things were things like Kodak cameras,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=168
Page 3045 Singer sewing machines, Uneeda biscuits, Kellogg's

Corn Flakes, but also Camel cigarettes beginning in

1913, this was a nationally advertised brand of

tobacco that had never existed before.  No tobacco

product had been advertised throughout the country on

new media, magazines, eventually radio, and things

like that.

So the war � taxation then also becomes important.  The different states realize they can tax cigarettes and get an enormous amount of money for their revenue.  So there are multiple social forces that lead to a rapid rise in cigarette consumption. Mechanization is another one, I mentioned that they became very cheap.

Also cigarettes were thought to be a safer form of smoke.  It made common sense that if a cigar was bad, then a little cigar was less bad.  It turns out to be false but how that was the thought, how could a big cigar be anything but worse than a little cigar.  There was not wide appreciation of the fact that cigarettes were distinctively dangerous.

And also, there was the understanding that cigarette smoke was a less injurious form of smoke, given the fears of tuberculosis, the fears that in the trenches of World War I people would be spitting

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=169
Page 3046 and transmitting germs.

And so since chewing tobacco was the

predominate form of tobacco used, cigarettes were

used as a form of tobacco use that did not involve

spitting, and therefore did not involve germ transfer

and the germ theory of disease that was dominant at

that time, that was regarded as a safer form of

smoke.

Q    After Camel introduced the nationwide

advertising, you said it was 1913, did it have an

effect on its sales?

A    It did.  Camels quickly become the most

popular cigarette in the United States.

Q    Now, at the same time as there's a

temperance movement, are there newspaper articles

that talk about smoking as actually being good for

you?

A    Yes.

Q    We have PDR 23, two examples of articles

from the New York Times.

MR. HAMMER:  Three examples.

MR. GDANSKI:  Three examples.  I'm sorry.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  We'd move into

evidence the underlying exhibits which is

(Exhibit PT 9019 was admitted into evidence.)

(Exhibit PT 9020 was admitted into evidence.)

(Exhibit PT 9021 was admitted into evidence.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Those exhibits are

admitted into evidence without objection.

Clerk, are you keeping track of that? BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    The first one on the top left, New York Times 1906 advises women to smoke.  Cleveland physician says it counteracts the effects of torn drinking?

A    Tea drinking.

Q    Tea drinking.  Sorry.  I was, like, what's torn drinking?  Tea drinking.

Let's go to the next one.  Tobacco smoke and teeth.  Tobacco smoke is a powerful disinfectant. That one I can read.  The one on the right, Smoking good for health.  French doctor finds it a preventive of spinal troubles.  Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Give us the context.  We talked about the prohibition era.  What's going on here?

A   Well, tobacco is also part of the official

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=171
Page 304� Pharmacopeia, the official list of drugs.  It is an

approved drug for therapeutic use in America until

the 20th Century.  So at the same time cigarettes

are being banned, they're also being advertised as

good for your health.

Q    Have you examined how messages on health are relayed and absorbed by smokers?

A    Yes.

Q    Is that something that the tobacco companies studied how smokers will perceive messages regarding the health effects of the product?

A    Eventually they studied it intensively.

Q    You mentioned World War I.  What was the impact and importance that World War I had on smoking behaviors and consumption?

A    Well, I mentioned that for the first time they were provided with rations, the whole generations of Doughboys, hundreds of thousands come home from the war essentially addicted to cigarettes, and they spread the habit that these strong young men seem to be doing fine with cigarettes, how bad could they be.  It was part of the social mix that lead to the disappearance of the early bans on cigarette sales, sir.

Q    What are the Doughboys?

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a video clip of a World War I newsreel, PT 548B.  Any objection?

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  What's that number being admitted into evidence?

MR. GDANSKI:  548B, as in boy.

THE COURT:  Okay. (Exhibit PT 548B was admitted into evidence.)

THE COURT:  Do you have a list that you're following?

THE CLERK:  No, I'm writing them down as we go.

THE COURT:  Do you have a list that you could give her?

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a list.  What we can do is, after we know what's in and what's not, we can give her a list along with the accompanying documents.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That will be fine.  I'm saying if you had a general list of these numbers that you're referring to so they can check them off the list, it will make it easier for her.

for the clerk and make it very simple for her.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll print one out now.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, what are we going to look at?

A    World War I era silent news clip about

showing soldiers getting cigarettes from the Red

Cross.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go ahead and played

that, please.

(Thereupon, the video clip was played.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, while it's playing, for how

long was a relationship between the tobacco industry

giving cigarettes to soldiers in the army or the

military as part of rations?

MR. FURR:  That misstates his prior

testimony, Your Honor.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Does it?

A    It does a little bit.

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, the objection was?

THE WITNESS:  He had it right.

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, did we � is there

still an objection?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=174
Page 3051 MR. FURR:  Well, I think Dr. Proctor

granted my objection.  He said I got it right. THE COURT:  So you're withdrawing the

objection or it's moot?

MR. FURR:  No.  It needs clarifying.  I

believe the doctor is about to. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Here is my next question.  Tell me why I'm wrong.

A    Repeat the question a better way.  It's how you phrased it.

Q    Here is the point.  We have a clip from World War I.  You mentioned a relationship where soldiers or individuals in the service were getting cigarettes.  Can you explain for how long that took place?

A   Well, cigarettes � soldiers got cigarettes as part of rations until the Vietnam War, actually toward the end of the Vietnam War, in the mid-'70s the policies changed.  Throughout that period cigarettes were part of rations.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's just play the rest of

that, please, Rob. (Thereupon, the video clip was played.)

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=175
Page 3052 THE WITNESS:  In World War II, in 1944

alone 100 billion cigarettes were given to

soldiers, 16 for every soldier that fought on

the American side per day, 16 per day per

soldier. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    These soldiers that come back from World War I, what played out thereafter as far as increase in the rise of smoking?

A    It skyrocketed.  The World War � most wars have been important in the rise of smoking.

Q    So today, you mentioned this earlier, there's no ashtray on the Judge's bench.  No one is smoking in the courthouse.  You see people smoking outside?

A    Yes.

Q    No one smokes inside the courthouse, right?

A    Right.

THE COURT:  Strike the reference to the

Judge's bench. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was there a time though, Dr. Proctor, when smoking was perceived in a completely different manner than we're perceiving today?

A    Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=176
Page 3053 Q    You're familiar with the term "presentism"?

A    Yes.

Q    What does it mean?

A    Presentism is a fallacy that historians try to avoid.  It would be reading the present into the past.  It's really the denial of historicity, the denial that the past is different from the present. The historian tries to see how the past has been different.  You sort of � I think I mentioned you try to walk in the shoes of the past.  That means understanding how things were different?

And in this context, here you can't smoke in this room, but 50 years ago you could.  The world has really changed when it comes to the acceptability of cigarettes in life.

Q    You have to define presentism.  You also have to define historicity.

A    Presentism would be reading the present into the past and thinking that just because we think something is true or beautiful or good, that that would also be the case in the past.  The past has had very different conceptions of what is true or good or beautiful.

By historicity I simply meant the fact that every age has a different spirit.  There's a spirit

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=177
Page 3054 of the times.  There were practices of the times that

were done, there was a time when there was slavery or

no women's rights, you know, the world has changed

dramatically.  It would be wrong to ignore those

dramatic changes.  That's what we do as historians,

we understanding change over time.

Q    So why in a case like this where we're dealing with cigarettes and a long arc of time, relatively long, let's say 100 plus years, why do we need to make sure we keep presentism in our mind?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Why is presentism important in this case? MR. FURR:  May I get a ruling on my

objection?

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Why is presentism important when it comes to cigarettes in this country?

A    Because it would be wrong to imagine that everyone has always known the things that we know about the harms of smoking today.  There's a time in the '50s when most doctors smoked.  Today that would never happen.  If we were to go to 100 doctors, you would not find more than about two who would smoke

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=178
Page 3055 cigarettes and maybe not even that.  In the 1950s it

would be over half were smoking cigarettes.

It would be wrong to imagine that there's

no difference, that the knowledge doctors have today

was the same as they had in the '50s or the '40s or

the '30s, and the same for ordinary smokers.

Ordinary smokers in the 1930s and '40s did not know

that it could cause deadly harm.  It was very, very

rare.  It would be cherrypicking to find examples

where a few people know something and assumed that

this was broadly known.

Q    What do you mean by that, cherrypicking?

A    It's a falsification of history to take a few exceptions in some distant time, say a few people knowing about smoking being addictive in the 1920s and '30s, that's true some people did, a very small number did.  Even if it's 100 people, it's not 100,000 or 100 million.  So it's very important to understand when you're looking at history, is this an exception or the rule?

People knew that America and Africa had once been joined.  Some people knew that hundreds of years ago, but it's not proven in science that the plates have drifted apart.  That's not proven until after World War II.  So there's a big difference

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=179
Page 3056 between a few people knowing something and it being a

dominant.

Q   We have some examples of some places and

circumstances in which smoking was permitted, where

today, of course, it would not be permitted.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a demonstrative of that, PDR 306.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  That's admitted into evidence without objection, PDR 306?

MR. FURR:  It's a demonstrative only. THE COURT:  Demonstrative only, not admitted into evidence. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    You said doctors smoked.  When did doctors' rates peak smoking?

A    1950 it peaks at about 60 percent of all doctors were smoking cigarettes.

Q    Nurses used to smoke, it was common? A    That was more common later.  It wasn't so long ago, but a third of all nurses actually smoked. Q    Patients, you could smoke in a hospital? A    Until the '70s, you could smoke in most hospitals.

Q    In the legislature and Congress �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=180
Page 3057 A    That was very common, even until later.

For example, the Democratic Party Convention of the

year 2000 was the very first convention that was

smoke free, the year 2000.  Airplanes, you could not

smoke in airplanes before World War II.  It's only

after World War II that you first get ashtrays on

planes, and it becomes common practice to smoke on

airplanes.

Q    Smoking, is it permitted on airplanes anymore in this country?

A    No, no.

Q    When did that stop?  Was it 60 years ago?

A    No.  It's in the 1990s, and on international flights even into the 2000s you could still smoke.

Q    Did the tobacco industry have a role in promoting smoking on planes in the cabin?

A    Yes, they did.

Q    Tell us about that.

A    Well, it mainly emerges out of the military, but the tobacco industry was trying to find ways to encourage smoking everywhere, so they collaborated with, like, people who would make tables and things like this, they would help them make little clip-on ashtrays and things like that.  So

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=181
Page 305� they would promote this idea of smoking anywhere.

Q    When discussions took place about removing

smoking from planes and banning it, did the industry

oppose that?

A    Vigorously, they fought it in multiple different ways.

Q    Did their opposition � did their fighting against removing smoking from planes delay by a number of years the period of time in which smoking was banned on planes?

A    Definitely, yes.

Q   Athletes, tell us about the prevalence of athletes and the normalcy of athletes smoking.

A    I think I mentioned as recently as 1964 out of the seven Mercury astronauts, four out of the seven Mercury astronauts from all three branches of the military were smokers.  So it was consistent with physical perfection.  You could still be a smoker in the 1950s, even in the '60s, that's how poorly the harms were understood.  Some of the coaches and athletes would smoke in the locker rooms, even into the '70s.  So it takes a while for the science that's really discovered and proven in the '50s to seep into broader culture.

Q    You said that it took a while for science.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=182
Page 3059 Were there references in textbooks or in other periodicals that, you know, smoking is not healthy for you in the !20s, !30s, and '40s.

A    Definitely.  Yeah, there's probably more known around 1900 with the anti-smoking movement than there is at the peak of mass marketing in the 1930s and MOs.  There's kind of a loss of knowledge. Smoking becomes more normalized.  There's a forgetting of the earlier critiques of tobacco.  So you're more likely to find people talking about the harms of smoking in around 1900 even than in the 1930s and MOs?

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a demonstrative,

PDR 240, Len Dawson.

MR. FURR:  No objection. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    This is quarterback Len Dawson from Superbowl Number 1?

A    Yes.

Q    He's smoking on the sidelines?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you just � today this would not be considered normal, right?

A    No, it would not be considered normal.

Q    Was this normal back then?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=183
Page 3060 A    Yes.  I mean, there was no law banning it

in, like, college athletics by this time, and that

would be illegal in college, NCAA rules for an �

athletes on a campus to smoke.

Q   What are the five peaks of the epidemic?

A   Well, the absolute peak of total cigarette consumption is 1982.  I think we have a chart of that.  That's when the total number of cigarettes peaked at 630 billion that year, 630 billion cigarettes were smoked in the US in 1982.

But the per capita adult peak is 1963.  The per capita total consumption peak is in 1977, because more and more youth are smoking.  So you've got a delay in that peak.  The peak production in the US is 1997.  The peak youth prevalence is 1997.  That's when the highest fraction of kids age 12 to 17 is smoking, 1997.  Then the peak death is recent, because of the delayed effect.

Q    So we have a demonstrative chart which can help explain some of the peaks and the periods, and you can explain what took place and when.  I'm going to write some of that on the board.

MR. GDANSKI:  Do you have an objection? MR. FURR:  Yeah, it wasn't disclosed to us,

if we can see it.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=184
Page 3061 Yes, I object.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let me grab the easel for a moment.

THE COURT:  While you're doing that, I think that I want to give the jury a restroom break.  Everybody need a quick restroom break? All right.  Please don't discuss the case among yourselves, with anybody else.  Don't do any independent research, don't use your electronic devices about the case.  We'll take a quick restroom break.  Thank you. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Did we need to deal with something on this document?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  The answer is no.

THE COURT:  All right.  The witness can step down and take a restroom break if you'd like.  We had a urologist here yesterday who had a very strong bladder and didn't need to use the restroom break.  I assume a historian might need to use the restroom.

THE WITNESS:  We're much more confined.

THE COURT:  All right.  So tonight I can go later tonight.  I cannot go later tomorrow

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=185
Page 3062 because I've got an event at 5:00 that I have to

leave for.  So if you guys need to stay later

tonight, I can stay later tonight.  I just can't

do it tomorrow.  I would prefer to it today

instead of tomorrow.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Do you overrule more objections later?  We'll stay late, if you overrule more objections later, we'll stay as late as you like.

THE COURT:  I'm neutral detached, it depends on what the law says.

MR. GDANSKI:  Are you referring to the jury staying late as well, is that what you're saying?  Because last night we did keep them to an extraordinarily late �

THE COURT:  I can tell them tomorrow I'm not going to keep them late.  Tomorrow I've got to be off the bench by no later than 5:00, maybe a couple minutes before 5:00.

MR. GDANSKI:  My own impression is, I don't think they view 5:00 is early but considering last night they stayed until 7:00 �

THE COURT:  You're not going to finish this witness tonight?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.  And Friday.

THE COURT:  Maybe we'll go a little bit later tonight.  Not extremely late.  Depending on how the jury feels about it, 5:30 or 6:00. Tomorrow I can't.  So I just wanted to let you know.

MR. GDANSKI:  Gotcha.

THE COURT:  Tomorrow I won't � tomorrow I don't believe I need to take a longer lunch, so we can take a shorter lunch tomorrow.  Friday I'll have to take a little bit longer lunch, okay?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Are we in recess?

THE COURT:  Yeah, you're in recess. (Whereupon, a recess was taken at 3:28 p.m.) (Thereupon, a recess was had at 3:28 p.m., after which the proceedings continued in Volume 22.)

THE COURT:  Anything before I bring the jury back in?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, I have a list of the proposed exhibits the plaintiff is going to use with the I.D. and the description.  And then it has a check mark for witness and date admitted.

THE COURT:  Give it to the clerk.

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, we would ask that when the list goes back, it would just be a list with just the number and without the descriptions since we have not had a chance --

THE COURT:  You're not going to make that the official list?

MS. LEHMAN:  No.

THE COURT:  She's going to create her own. That's just to help her because you guys are throwing a bunch of numbers at her and she doesn't know -- that's not going to go into evidence.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, before we broke, you had spit

out a bunch of information about five peaks of

important pieces of data, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Let's use a timeline and a graph with some

information so you can put it into perspective, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    We have PDR 270.

While we're putting that up, just for the

record, I made a mistake on one of the earlier

demonstratives, PDR 88.  I forgot to read off PT

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=194
Page 3071 5835.

THE COURT:  Is that a demonstrative?

MR. GDANSKI:  It was on the demonstrative. It was one of the ones we admitted.  I just didn't read it off.

THE COURT:  Do you need that admitted into evidence?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Is there any objection?

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  What's the number?

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 5835.

THE COURT:  That's admitted without objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  And the PTs are identified on the exhibit list.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, this exhibit is demonstrative.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's a demonstrative.

THE COURT:  I thought you just asked me to admit the one that you just read off.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir, that's correct. That was the one from earlier.  I made a mistake and forgot to read it.

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.  But not this one?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=195
Page 3072 THE COURT:  That's not the one we were just

referring to?

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, one just went on

the board and that's reflective of the

demonstrative.

THE COURT:  That's the demonstrative.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Moving on to what we're looking at right

now.

Dr. Proctor, what are we looking at?

A    This is a chart comparing two sets of data.

One is the total cigarette consumption per year.  You

get about 2 billion cigarettes smoked in the United

States in 1900.  It grows rapidly in World War I,

with the recession after World War I.  The Roaring

'20s, it grows rapidly.  The Great Depression, there

is a significant drop in cigarette consumption down

to about 100 billion per year.  And then World War

II, another rapid increase when soldiers get

cigarettes as part of their rations.

New evidence here emerges in the

epidemiology and animal experiments and their being

widely reported in the Popular Press poses the

largest decline right here, about 20 billion

cigarettes.  Continues to � the industry plans a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=196
Page 3073 response at that point, rescues the reputation of the

cigarette.  Various ups and downs, continues to

increase until 1982, at the peak of 630 billion

cigarettes smoked.  It's been declining ever since.

Now, we're down to around 270 billion cigarettes

smoked per year in the United States.

The red line is the male lung cancer rate

per 100,000 Americans.  The number is dropping to

zero there.  It shouldn't be there.  In any event,

what we see is the lag effect that the � it is also

called parallelism � that lung cancer grows very

rapidly with about a 20-year delay or 30-year delay

from the rise of the cigarette.

Then it's also started declining as a

result of the decline in cigarette consumption.

Q Okay. Going back to the five peaks you had referenced beforehand. When did those take place now that we have some dates on the board?

A    Those are not shown here.

Q    I know they're not shown.

A    I can just tell you.

Q    Please.

A The per capita peak occurs here in 1963. It's not shown here, so it's weird to point to it. The � I mentioned the other peaks.  The total

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=197
Page 3074 production peaks in 1997 because of exports have

increased up to that point.  I mentioned youth smoking peaks in the late 1990s and so forth. Q    Thank you.

You can take that down, Rob.  Thank you. Cigarettes in films.  Have you examined films and popular media to see how cigarettes were portrayed?

A    Yes.

Q    Today, are cigarettes � do they still appear in films?

MR. FURR:  Objection with respect to what's happening today.  It's beyond the scope of historical testimony.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, smoking is still very common.  It's actually more common in movies than in real life. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Going back to the '30s, '40s and '50s, can we look at how smoking was portrayed in films to get a sense of how smoking was viewed culturally in the environment ?

A    You can.

Q    Have you done it?

Page 3076 A    Paul Henry does a romantic gesture of

lighting two cigarettes and handing one to the woman,

and then they blow their smoke together in sort of a

mingling.  After the censorship codes of the '30s

when you were no longer allowed to show sexuality on

film, cigarettes were often used to represent

sexuality in kind of an indirect way.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's play it, please.  Thank you. (Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Jarred, please help me.

Yes.

May I sometimes cuddle you.

Whatever you'd like.  It's your

it?

SPEAKER SPEAKER SPEAKER home too. (Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    After this film, was that something that became common amongst smokers, where a man would light two cigarettes at once and give it to the woman?

A    It became common in real life.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=200
Page 3077 Q    In real life?

A    People imitated the part. Q    The film To Have and Have Not, are you familiar with that?

A    Yes.

Q    We have an excerpt, PT 547A, 547A.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So PT 547A. is admitted

into evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT547A was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    It's Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall. They're obviously tremendous Hollywood stars.

A    They were, yes.

Q    Both of these films, for one moment here � did tobacco companies pay to have the cigarettes in the movie?

A    I don't think so, no.  Some films like this would occasionally be co-branded where the poster would, say, featuring a particular cigarette, but I don't think there is evidence these are product placements or anything.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go ahead and play this. (Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as follows:)

(Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   Were cigarettes portrayed in a glamorous,

in this case an almost seductive fashion?

A    And naughty.  She's naughty, a bad girl. Q    Taking us back we talked about presentism.

We watched two clips just now.  Why is that important

in 2015 when we have to put everything into proper

context?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  He explained this.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm talking about these two clips.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I think in this instance the presentism problem is not very big because you could easily see something like that today.  You still have Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly just doing it in a different kind of version.  So I think the Hollywood romance with cigarettes is still going full blast. Q    When folks would see a film like this back

in the '30s and '40s, did they have a reaction that

was, hey, that doesn't look bad?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=202
Page 3079 MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Calls for

speculation.  Beyond this witness' knowledge. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was smoking an everyday normal, natural thing to do back in the '30s and '40s?

A    Certainly in Hollywood, yeah, just as it is today.

Q    On your web site, on the society � SRITA, what does that stand for again?

A    Stanford Research Into Tobacco Advertising.

Q    On that web site, do you break up some of the advertisements into some of the different themes that the industry would use?

A    We do.

Q    Is one of the themes advertisements featuring health care professionals?

A    Yes.

Q    Doctors, physicians, nurses?

A    Yes.

Q    Certain kinds of doctors?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a demonstrative, PDR

153.  We'd move into evidence the underlying

advertisements, the underlying exhibits.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=203
Page 3080 MR. FURR:  We have no objection to the

demonstrative.  As I understand it, Counsel is

seeking to move into evidence only the specific

advertisements depicted in this demonstrative.

If that's the case, no objection.

THE COURT:  Is that the case?

MR. GDANSKI:  For now I'll just show the demonstrative, and we can figure out which exact specific ads will be in evidence.

THE COURT:  Well, then, there's no stipulation to it.  So we'll just reserve ruling on that objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  No objection to the demonstrative, right.

MR. FURR:  No objection to the demonstrative.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  We can clear it up and show it to the jury and figure out the nuances. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Okay.  So this is PDR 153.  Health care professionals.  Doctor, what's the historical significance of using health care professionals in cigarette advertisements?

A    Well, in the period prior to 1954, there

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=204
Page 3081 was overt competition between the different companies

for health reassurance.  After 1953, the companies

bond together and agree not to compete on health

grounds, and they form a collaboration which involves

denying there are any health harms.  So this is I

think mostly from that earlier era, that pre-1953

era, where they are using doctors to say this brand

is recommended by these doctors.  Using medical

authority, nursing authority to sell cigarettes.

Q    Let's take a look at a couple of them for a moment.

Let's blow up the top left, one at a time. That's good.  Thanks Rob.

The top left is for Camels.  The one on the left is for Camels.  Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Doctor, what were the most popular brands of cigarettes from the '30s and '40s?

A    Camels, Lucky Strike and Chesterfield, I think are the three most common.

Q    This one says, Not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels. Do you see?

A    Yes.

Q    On the bottom it says, Start your own 30

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3082 days Camel mildness test today.

A    Right.

Q    Did the cigarettes encourage nonsmokers to start smoking?  The advertisements, I should say.

A    The companies did, yes.

Q    Have these companies ever acknowledged that we encouraged nonsmokers to start smoking?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor. Objection.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  In the pretrial, there was a motion made by defense with respect to improper arguments based on prior cases.  One of the � a component of one of the motions made was to preclude plaintiffs from suggesting in front of the jury that somehow we had behaved tortiously because we had failed to apologize or acknowledge prior wrongful conduct.  The Court granted that motion.  Which one is it?  The Court granted that motion.  It was motion number 19 on the pretrial order.  Counsel should be familiar with that and should know not to ask those types of questions in the presence of the jury.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=206
Page 3083 MR. GDANSKI:  Why don't you hand a copy of

that to the Court, and then show me the spot

where it says I can't do what I just did.

THE COURT:  Have these companies ever acknowledged � what was the question?

MR. GDANSKI:  Have they ever acknowledged that they wanted to get nonsmokers to start smoking.

I challenge Mr. Furr to give you the order to show where it says that I did violate the order.  He knows it doesn't.  He's something else.

THE COURT:  Can you tell me � that we encourage nonsmokers �

MR. GDANSKI:  To start smoking.

THE COURT:  The record is kind of �

MR. GDANSKI:  The question is �

THE COURT:  Did they encourage nonsmokers to start smoking.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's essentially the question.  I don't know how it came out on the transcript, but I can guarantee you, it's not in your pretrial order.  There is something about not taking responsibilities.  There is something about �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=207
Page 3084 THE COURT:  He's talking about apologizing.

He's not asking about apologizing.

MR. FURR:  It was broader than that.  It was based upon suggesting to the jury that the company had a duty to acknowledge historical conduct.  And the fact � the argument made was it's plaintiff's burden to prove that historical conduct was wrongful, and that we had no duty to say that anything we did in the past was wrong. It was worded more generically than counsel seems to understand.  The whole point was they can't stand up and argue to the jury that they should find us liable in this case because we have failed to acknowledge that we did something that they say was wrongful in the past.

MR. GDANSKI:  I've done no such thing. I've asked a simple question that doesn't violate any order.  I asked if they ever acknowledged that they wanted to get nonsmokers to start smoking.  It comes in in every case, but it doesn't violate Your Honor's order.  They never moved in limine.  They started out by suggesting that I immediately violated a pretrial order and now they're backtracking and saying it's broader than what Your Honor

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=208
Page 3085 intended.  It's perfectly and obviously

appropriate.

What is the effect of cigarette advertisements?  Is it to get nonsmokers to start smoking or is it to keep smokers smoking or both?  This obviously needs to be explained in the context of a case like this.  If they have some problem with how it's argued in closing, which we're so far from, and that's an entirely different story.  I'm most certainly allowed to ask this question.

THE COURT:  I think the concern is that this opens the door for the witness to possibly blow this up.  Why don't we bring the witness over here and explain to him my prior ruling, so the witness is clear on that, and then we can continue the line of questioning.  Then at least the witness knows what not to say.

MR. GDANSKI:  The witness will not say that they failed �

MR. FURR:  What is the relevance of whether we �

THE COURT:  That's a different objection.

MR. FURR:  I'm making an objection. There's no relevance to whether we've ever said

MR. GDANSKI:  There's plenty of relevance to it.  It goes to what the purpose and intent of advertising is.  It goes to how and why they spent billions of dollars advertising.  They want to chop out every single aspect of this case.  Advertising is a huge component.  You can't just show ads �

THE COURT:  They acknowledge that.

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course.

THE COURT:  I understand that.  There's no relevance to the question as to them acknowledging it.  There's relevance to the question which is, has the companies � are these advertisements or do the companies, by way of these advertisements, try to encourage nonsmokers.  Obviously, yes.  That's the whole purpose of advertising.  They wouldn't spend a dollar on advertising if they didn't want to get a � so I don't see how that's objectionable.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, right.  Exactly.

THE COURT:  The whole purpose is to get a nonsmoker to smoke.  That's what the whole purposes of the advertising is.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's funny you say that.  It

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=210
Page 3087 may seem very obvious and clear to you, but it's

not to them.  They have historically disagreed

with that and maintained openly and publicly �

THE COURT:  You can ask all the questions you want about that.  This jury knows the whole purpose of the advertising is to get a nonsmoker to smoke.  They already know that.  You can tell this jury six times the same thing; they already know that.  Everybody knows that.  There's nobody that � you know, if you have a functioning brain you know that, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'd like to put it into evidence.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.  You can do that.  We don't have to know � we don't have to say that they acknowledged it or not because that's not relevant.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, the whole point is this .

THE COURT:  Their acknowledgment of it or not doesn't matter.

MR. GDANSKI:  It does matter.

THE COURT:  Why?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because their entire defense to the advertisements is that the advertisements

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=211
Page 308� have no effect on smoking behaviors.  As

ludicrous as it may sound to you, and as

rejectable as it is, it is a defense and I need

to take that away by demonstrating the fact that

despite the fact --

THE COURT:  What's your argument as to why their acknowledgment of it, just like their apology � what does that have to do with it? That doesn't go to the issue of proving a conspiracy of the concealment.

MR. GDANSKI: It goes exactly to the heart of the issue of concealment, and it goes to the heart of the issue of why they advertised.

THE COURT:  No, no, no.  You can go to the issue of concealment or conspiracy without � whether they acknowledge it or not.  It doesn't matter what they acknowledge.  It really doesn't matter.

Now, if you have an admission against interest because they do acknowledge it, then that is relevant.  You can get that into evidence.  That's not a problem.

MR. GDANSKI: Let me break that down one second. I have an admission against interest where they say our advertisements don't get

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=212
Page 3089 people to start smoking.  Of course it does.

They falsely advertise.  They advertise in a

misleading fashion, and then they said our

advertisements don't impact people to start

smoking.

THE COURT:  You want me to point this out to the witness or you say he already knows this? He's already been told this.

MR. GDANSKI:  He will not blurt that out. But the question of whether they've ever stated or denied, because they did deny � they do deny that they marketed to children, they did deny that their advertisements had an impact on smokers.

THE COURT:  All right.  So you can ask affirmatively.  You can't ask him about silence of the company.  Right now you're asking about silence.  In other words, the fact � the absence of their acknowledgment.  However, you can ask him about statements that they did make where they said the contrary, that they are � that they deny that that's what they're trying to do, all that kind of stuff.  Those are statements.

So I'm going to sustain the objection in

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=213
Page 3090 terms of the use of the word "acknowledgment."

You can still � you can ask them not as to

whether the company acknowledged it, but just as

to whether that's the purpose of it or whether

that's what was going on or, you know, whatever

information this witness may have on it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

MR. FURR:  I would object.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, I didn't do the

affirmative denial.

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain it as far

as the acknowledgment is concerned.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, historically, has the intended

effect of cigarette advertisements been to get

nonsmokers, including youth, to start smoking?

A    Yes.  I think that's fair.

Q    Has the industry affirmatively denied

publicly that they ever intended or meant for youth

to start smoking?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.  They denied marketing

to youth.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=214
Page 3091 BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do their internal documents that we'11 look

at demonstrate whether or not they did or did not

actually market to youth?

A    Yes.  That's very clear.

Q    What does it clearly establish?

A    They massively targeted youth for decades.

Q    Let's go to the bottom row, third one. You have Camel cigarettes made by R.J. Reynolds?

A    Yes.

Q    It says, More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    So what's the historical significance of the advertising campaign "More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette"?

A    Well, they're exploiting medical authority here.  This is an image of a doctor.  It's not a real doctor. It's an image of a doctor and the M and the D, here, the subtle iconography here representing health.  This is a period when they are all competing with one another for the health market.

Later they stopped competing and started

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=215
Page 3092 collaborating in the common denial of health harms.

So this is the pre-conspiracy era.

Q    When did the conspiracy of the tobacco companies start?

A    It starts on December 14th, 1953.

Q    How many � if we were to take all of the different periodicals which cigarette advertisements appear, what are we talking about volume-wise?

A    Well, if you stack up the actual journals, it would certainly fill this courtroom easily.

Q    Fill it from front to end.

A    The magazines?  Many times over.

Q    I have here, by way of example, a Life Magazine.  We're looking at a slide that has multiple ads on it.

Did ads just like this one, More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette, actually appear in actual magazines read by real people?

A    Yeah, millions of copies.  They're not just like that.  They would be in vivid color.  That one, the reds have disappeared as a result of aniline dyes being photosensitive.  Apart from that, yeah, it would be much more vivid in color.

Q    Did the advertisements influence and impact

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=216
Page 3093 people's smoking behaviors?

A    Of course.

Q    How was it that Reynolds is even able to claim that more doctors smoke their brand?

A    Well, this was a campaign organized by the SD Company for Philip Morris � sorry, for Reynolds, one of their main advertisers.  The companies would go to medical conventions and hand out cigarettes. If you're a doctor, you'd find a pack of cigarettes on your pillow.  It happened into the 1960s.

In this instance SD Company would give Camels to the doctors at a medical meeting, and then when they were coming out, they'd say what cigarette do you have in your pocket.  They'd say, well, I have Camels.  So that's how they were able to claim more doctors smoked Camels than any other cigarette.

Q    Is that a true and accurate statement, that more doctors actually smoked Camels?

A    I don't know if it's true or not, but the survey on which it's based is bogus.

Q    It's fraud.

A    It's a fraud.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

Argumentative.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Why do you lecture on the importance and

the significant impact of nicotine addiction?

A    Because you can't understand the cigarette epidemic unless you understand the mechanism of addiction.  It would be like trying to write the history of Galileo without understanding the laws of interia and geocentrism and heliocentrism and the fundamental science involved in that history.

Q    What do you know about that history as it relates to the history of nicotine addiction?

A   As we said, nicotine addiction causes people to continue to smoke, which causes the diseases.

Q    Did Camel also go on TV and advertise using the physician as the person who is smoking the Camel cigarette?

Q   When did advertisements on TV for

cigarettes stop?

A    Direct commercials stopped in 1971. Indirect ads for television continued through sports sponsorship.  Virginia Slims tennis was heavily televised.  Winston NASCAR.  So there are indirect ads that continue after the broadcast ban of 1971, which ended what we think of as direct commercials for a particular brand of cigarettes.

Q    This is 1949, "What Cigarette Do You Smoke, Doctor."

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go ahead and play that, please. (Thereupon, the following video clip was played for the jury:)

SPEAKER:  What cigarette do you smoke. You'll be interested to know how the doctors of America answered that question.

Tens of thousands of doctors, doctors in all parts of the country, in every state of the union, doctors in every branch of medicine were asked:  What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?  In this nationwide survey of general practitioners, surgeons, throat specialists, diagnosticians and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=222
Page 3099 so on, the brand named most was Camel.

Yes, according to this survey, more doctors

smoke Camels than any other cigarette.

Try Camels yourself.  Make the one sensible

cigarette test.  Make your own 30-day Camel

mildness test in your T zone.  Smoke only Camels

for 30 days.  Enjoy Camels's rich full flavor

and see how well Camels agree with your throat

pack after pack, week after week.  See for

yourself why Camels are so popular with the

doctors of America.

(Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Doctor, does the historical record

regarding smoking initiation indicate that nicotine

addiction can begin even from the first cigarette?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading,

argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What do we know from a historical

Q    Have you reviewed, published, lectured,

discussed at the highest levels of American

government, in medical schools talked to physicians

about the issue as to how nicotine addiction begins?

A    Not really at the cigarette level, no. Q    At the cigarette level?

A    At the how many cigarettes.  You know, I know something about that, but I haven't lectured about it.

Q    What do you know about it? MR. FURR:  Same objection. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Philip Morris, they also used television advertisements, right? A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 4736A. MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  PT 4736A is admitted into evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT4736A was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Doctor, tell us what are we going to see. A    This is a different company.  R.J. Reynolds

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=224
Page 3101 was the previous company we were looking at.  This

one is the Philip Morris company, which had a brand

called Philip Morris.  It also later had a brand �

actually, at the same time called Marlboro, a women's

cigarette, and then later a man's cigarette.  But

here the themes of luxury are being used and dessert.

There's � she has the jewelry, the gown and so

forth.  So it's the themes of elegance, glamor,

luxury attached to Philip Morris.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go ahead and play that,

please.

(Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as

follows:)

SPEAKER:  Something wonderful happens when

you change to Philip Morris.  You'll feel

better.

SPEAKER:  Did you say I'll feel better

smoking Philip Morris?

SPEAKER:  Yes, you'll feel better and here

are the reasons why.  In case after case, coughs

due to smoking disappear.  Parched throat clears

up.  That stale smoked-out feeling vanishes.

SPEAKER:  That is wonderful.

SPEAKER:  When you change to Philip Morris,

you really taste your cigarette once again, the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=225
Page 3102 clear, clean taste of fine mellow tobacco.  And

your food will taste better too.

SPEAKER:  But why do these wonderful things happen when I change to Philip Morris?

SPEAKER:  Because you'll be smoking the one cigarette with a difference in manufacture, an important difference that avoids the common cause of cigarette irritation.

Day after day, you'll be smoking these cigarettes recommended by eminent nose and throat specialists to patients who smoke.  The one cigarette proved definitely milder than any other leading brand.

Whether you've been smoking for 10 months or 10 years, something wonderful happens. You'll feel better when you change to Philip Morris.

So remember, next time you buy cigarettes, be sure you call for Philip Morris and feel something wonderful happen to you. (Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Looking at that ad now, that's not the kind of thing you'd see today.  Was that just normal back in the day?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=226
Page 3103 A    It was until 1953 when this type of

competitive health reassurance stopped.  It's

collaborate health reassurance after '53.  This was

from the pre-conspiracy era of competitive health

reassurance.

Q    You've said that a couple of times.  What are you referring to?  What's the difference in the time frame as to how they were collaborative and competitive health reassurance?

A    The Plaza Hotel meeting of December 14 and 15 of 1953 is when the companies get together and form a collaborative plan to deny the harms of smoking.  They also agree not to compete on overt health grounds.  Here there is a competition based on diethylene glycol, the secret ingredient of Philip Morris.  They're claiming that's less irritating than the glycerins used in other brands.  That type of advertising stops in 1953.

Q    From 1953 you said that the tobacco companies talk about it with specificity.  They started a conspiracy.

A    Yes.

Q    Was Philip Morris, Reynolds, Lorillard, were they all parts of the conspiracy?

A    They were all part of it, yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=227
Page 3104 Q    Was Liggett part of the conspiracy?

A    Not originally.  They joined later. Q    For how many years and decades did this conspiracy continue?

A    For many decades after that point. Q    Did they continue to advertise and market cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    Just in a different manner and fashion?

A    They're doing competitive marketing.  Each company obviously wants to sell the most cigarettes but they're collaborating with regard to what they admit and what they conceal about the harms of smoking.

Q    Did Chesterfield � Chesterfield cigarettes, who manufactured those?

A    That's the Liggett company, Liggett and Myers.

Q    Chesterfield, did that used to be a popular brand of cigarettes?

A    Yeah, it was one of the three big standard brands.  Early on the companies had standard brands that they would really push as their singular focus.

Q    Did Chesterfield also have television advertisements?

MS. RUIZ:  No objection.

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, it's called PTVACHESl?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.  It's PTVACHESl.  That's it.

THE COURT:  There's no objection to this?

MS. RUIZ:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Is there any objection to the label?

MR. FURR:  I object.

MR. GDANSKI:  Me too.

THE COURT:  I'll admit it into evidence without objection.  We have to have a talk about your numbering system.  For now, it's admitted into evidence without objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I agree. (Exhibit PTVACHESl was admitted into evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go ahead and take a look and we'll play that. (Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Now the first cigarette to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=229
Page 3106 present this scientific evidence on the effects

of smoking.  A medical specialist is making regular examinations on groups of people from various walks of life.  Eighty-five percent of this group smoked Chesterfields for average of over 10 years.  After eight months, the medical specialist reports that he observed no adverse effects of the nose, throat, and sinuses of the group from smoking Chesterfield.  I'd say that means real mildness.  Whether you smoke regular or king size, you'll find premium quality Chesterfields much milder. (Thereupon, the video clip was concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did all of the companies use this theme of doctors promoting the brand as milder or safer? A    Yes.

Q    Did that work?  Did that have an impact? A    Yes. Q    Tell us.

A    That's a mixed impact.  One of the reasons that this type of advertising was stopped is that some people were actually scared because they were constantly reminding smokers of irritation of the throat, you know, the harms.  So that's one effect.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=230
Page 3107 I think the more general effect earlier on

is a type of reassurance.  That's why they were doing

it in the first place, was to sell more cigarettes.

Q    Did the assurances that the cigarette was less harmful or less harsh or it didn't have any effect on the chest, did that actually work to maintain and increase the sale of cigarettes? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   What was the impact of those assurances that, for example, there's no effect on the chest or it's milder?

A    Well, the whole point of mildness � until the 1960s, the main theory of cancer causation was irritation.  After the 1950s, you get the mutation theory.  In this earlier period, mildness was a type of code or euphemism for not causing cancer.  So there's also that going on.

Q    Did cigarette companies and tobacco companies also use ads that portrayed individuals as healthy, showed young people in the ads, some showed children in the ads?

A   Well, yeah, those are sort of two separate things, but yeah, they would show young healthy

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=231
Page 310� people smoking, and they would sometimes show very

young people, like babies, as kind of the � they

call it kind of a cuteness advertising.  The

baby would recommend a cigarette to his or her mother

as kind of a cuteness theme.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have examples of that, PDR

154 .

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Can we

approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  First of all, as a matter of

process, Mr. Gdanski, I have an objection to the

babies ads.  He more or less directly elicited

the testimony from the witness before giving me

a chance to approach the bench.  So I'm not

necessarily pleased about that.

Your Honor, be that as it may, we've given

them lots of leeway on ads and we continue to

give them lots of leeway on ads, on things that

have nothing to do with Mr. Shulman.  There's

two ads on this demonstrative that I object to.

There's two babies.  This has nothing to do with

Mr. Shulman.  In fact, in this case, Mr. Shulman

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=232
Page 3109 is alive and has testified.  We know what ads

Mr. Shulman said he saw.  Some of them were my

client's ads.  Some of them were from Marlboro

cigarettes and are the cowboy ads, which I

assume Mr. Gdanski is going to show, and I have

no objection to it.  But the only reason to show

these two baby ads, these two down here, is to

inflame the jury.  It has nothing to do with

Mr. Shulman's case.  We're trying to give them

leeway on the general stuff, but there's no

reason to put two ads of babies calling for

cigarettes when Mr. Shulman said he's never seen

anything like that and it had no effect on him

whatsoever.

THE COURT:  Doesn't it go to their claim for punitives, though?

MR. BRENNER:  No.  At some point we have to have a discussion.  The plaintiff's position is any bad conduct is punitive damages regardless of whether it has any connection to Mr. Shulman. We've actually dealt with this pretrial.  We definitely do not have time to do this at a sidebar.  But, just, general, hey, they are kind of a crappy company who have done something, they are kind of a crappy company.  That is not

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=233
Page 3110 punitive damages or illegal or anything else for

that matter.  I would object to those two ads.

I'm fine with the rest of these.  In fact, I'm

fine with all these composites ones.  It's just

these two that have images that are unnecessary

and unduly prejudicial.

THE COURT:  Can somebody � the print is so small I can't read what's down here.  Does somebody want to be able to read that to me?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It says, Babies like to smoke cigarettes, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  He's joking.

MR. BRENNER:  One of them says, Gee, mommy � this is a baby talking to her mom. Gee, mommy � I can't read the next word � something like, you should enjoy your Marlboro.

THE COURT:  That, I could see.  The other ones down there I can't see.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm only objecting to two of them.  That's the gee, mommy, a baby talking to the mom.  This one I can't read.  That's the only picture I have.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's been used in other trials.

MR. GDANSKI:  I've used this advertisement

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=234
Page 3111 in personally many trials with Philip Morris,

and I know it's been used in � probably in

excess of 100 more trials.  It is a real ad that

really � and brand that influences smoking

culture, smoking behavior.  We must be able to

contextualize this story from the extreme to the

somewhat normal.  And the fact of the matter is

that it was normal to use babies in

advertisements to sell cigarettes, just as it is

today to use children in ads to sell Coca-Cola

or Nike products.  The fact is that cigarettes

were normal.

Their defense in the case �

THE COURT:  Your objection is it's overly prejudicial?

MR. BRENNER:  Prejudice outweighs any relevance.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's supremely relevant. There's no prejudice because of their ad.  It's Philip Morris's statement, but how else �

THE COURT:  It's not like I'm looking at some gruesome picture or something like that.  I just don't see it as overly prejudicial in weighing the items.  I don't know how relevant it is.  It may have only minimal relevant value,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=235
Page 3112 but I don't believe that it's overly

prejudicial.  There has been already lots of

testimony that there's been advertising to

youth.  This is not necessarily advertising to

youth.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

THE COURT:  This is a baby used in an advertisement to presumptively adults, mothers.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's exactly right.

THE COURT:  The targeted audience is a mother, I believe.  So this is really advertising to women.  The question is, how remote is that to Mr. Shulman who is a man?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's ones for men, too. It's not just to women.

THE COURT:  You have to sort of make that leap that the assumption is that it's an advertisement to women.  Men also have babies. And so even though it refers to mother, men also have children.

So because of that, I'm going to overrule the objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, sir. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  PDR 154, let's go

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=236
Page 3113 ahead and put that up.  We'd move these

advertisements into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  With the same �

THE COURT:  Objection?

MR. BRENNER:  We'll work on which ones actually has that off the record.  So defer on the actual advertisements.

THE COURT:  I guess I would admit it into evidence over the objections that were just made.

MR. BRENNER:  No.  The way the exhibits numbers are, we don't know which ads are actually being put in.  The ones on this screen are fine.  The same thing with the prior demonstrative.  We'll have to get together and decide which ones �

THE COURT:  So PDR 154 will be deferred as to whether it will be admitted or not at this point?

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, you have � the title is "Young, Fun and Healthy."  Can you just describe some of the types of messages you see in advertisements that portrayed people of that nature, young, fun and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=237
Page 3114 healthy?

A    Well, you have some of the upper left sort

of school days, college days themes here.  The fun of

a vacation outdoors.  More college themes up here on

the right.  She has a prom ticket here, the second

one I sort of rushed through, that's a ticket to the

prom here.

Then another one is the inhaling themes, you should not � you needn't worry your throat with Philip Morris because of that secret ingredient, the diethylene glycol, that they would advertise as better than the glycerin additives.

These are a little different.  These are the cuteness themes I mentioned.  It's simply showing how ordinary it is to conjoin a baby with a cigarette.  It's just not that big a deal.  It was as if you were to put a top hat on a baby.  Sometimes there would be pictures of a baby smoking, just as kind of a joke.  It doesn't mean they're marketing to youth in that sense.  They're just showing how ordinary it is to smoke.

This one is also different.  That's got a � this is one of the medicinal cigarettes.  The Kools, which had menthol, that were introduced in the 1930s made by Brown & Williamson.  This showed the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=238
Page 3115 cool penguin, he often had a stethoscope around his

neck.  These were the cigarettes that people often

switched to when they had a cold.  So if you had a

cold, in the same way you might take a menthol candy

drop or something like that, you would smoke a

mentholated cigarette to give you that cool

sensation.

Later in the 1950s menthols become a

regular daily cigarette as opposed to one you only

smoked when you have a cold.  Again, it's a type of

medical reassurance.

Q    Menthol in cigarettes, is menthol an additive?

A    It is.  It's from the mint plant.  Now, for many decades, it's been manufactured in synthetic form rather than actually just squeezed from peppermint leaves.

Q    Did the industry chose to add menthol to cigarettes?

A    Yes, very commonly.  It's about a third of all cigarettes have menthol as a characterizing flavor, namely a branded concept.  And then a substantially larger number have it as a minor ingredient.

Q    What's the number one menthol brand in the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=239
Page 3116 country?

A    I think it's Newport.

Q    That's the Lorillard cigarette that

Reynolds purchased?

A    Yes.

Q Now, has the scientific community studied what impact menthol has on cigarettes and cigarette smoking?

A    Yes.

Q    What do you know?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  Several objections.

THE COURT:  The question is has the scientific community studied what impact menthol has on cigarettes and cigarette smoking.

MR. FURR:  He said what do you know.

MR. GDANSKI:  He said yes to that question. My next question would have been what do you know.

MR. FURR:  Relevance.  It's undisputed. Mr. Shulman never smoked a brand of cigarette

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=240
Page 3117 for which menthol was a characterizing flavor.

It's undisputed.

Second, this is not a matter of concealing or agreeing to conceal.  It has nothing to do with the punitive damages claims.  It can't come in under the guise of reprehensibility.

Third �

THE COURT:  How can it go to the issue of concealment when this is not concealment.  What they're doing is putting a flavor into the cigarettes to make it more attractive to the taste, and, therefore, they have more customers. How does that go to a conspiracy of concealment?

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is why.

THE COURT:  That's different than concealing the fact that it's bad for your health, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll tell you why.  There's three different reasons why.  Number one is the conspiracy and the concealment goes to the conspiracy to conceal information regarding the addictiveness to smoking.

THE COURT:  That's a general problem. You've got all kinds of other evidence of that, I'm sure.

MR. FURR:  Yes, they have an addiction expert.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, no, no.  I'm not going to ask Mr. Furr a question.

THE COURT:  The menthol makes the cigarette more addictive?

MR. GDANSKI: Yes, sir. The only ones who can analyze that and study it are the people who have ability to do retrospective full historical analysis. No medical doctor or pulmonary doctor can come in and say I looked in your lungs and I see menthol addiction.  It's going to be someone

	Has there been any year since 1972 that a

A    No.

Q    Are Marlboro cigarettes a number one consumer product that causes death in the history of man?

A    Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative, Your Honor, and leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Of the cigarette brands that exist, Dr. Proctor, what is the brand that is the number one contributor to death?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Is there a branded product that has caused more harm ever than Marlboro cigarettes? MR. FURR:  Same objection. THE COURT:  Will the parties approach? (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  The objection is argumentative. I'm trying to figure out where you're going with this thing.  You're asking him whether Marlboro is the one that's most � how would he know

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=250
Page 3127 which brand caused more deaths from cigarettes?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because he has studied it. He's looked at it, he's analyzed it, he's published on it, he's lectured on it.  He knows it because this is what he does.

THE COURT:  Why is it argumentative?

MR. BRENNER:  That's the closing argument he's doing.  He wants this witness to say it's the biggest death producing thing.  This idea that any time this guy reads something he now becomes an expert on it is farcical.  He is not an epidemiologist.

THE COURT:  Is that something that's for cross-examination?  Doesn't that go to the weight of it?

MR. BRENNER:  No.  Under what Mr. Gdanski has told you he could do, Mr. Gdanski could testify at the next trial because I can assure you he knows all these things too because he's read and seen all these studies.

THE COURT: Then the objection is not argumentative. The objection is that it's beyond the scope of the witness.

MR. BRENNER:  Well, it's both.  It's argumentative �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=251
Page 312� THE COURT:  That's not he objection you

made.

MR. BRENNER:  I think the way he's phrasing it is argumentative.  It's also beyond the scope.  Frankly, I think it's the third time he's asked the same question.  It's not for this witness to talk about what cigarette causes the most death.  I don't think it's a proper argument.

THE COURT:  Give me a proffer as to what he's going to say as to how he knows Marlboro is the product that has � Marlboro is the brand that Mr. Shulman smoked, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

MR. BRENNER:  One of them.

THE COURT:  It clearly has relevance.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

THE COURT:  So we're beyond the relevance point.  The question then becomes whether this witness can answer based on what information he has got.  I don't think it's argumentative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I know he's able to answer it because I have seen him answer it and explain it in many trials.  His answer is going to be yes, it is because it's been the number one selling

pgNbr=252
Page 3129 cigarette.

THE COURT:  How does he know it's the number one?

MR. GDANSKI:  He just testified to that. That's not even disputed.

THE COURT:  How does he know that?  Is it an opinion pole?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's been a tremendous amount of data regarding the market share of Marlboro cigarettes that clearly undeniably and indisputably demonstrates that Marlboro has been the number one selling cigarette in this country since 1972.  That's how he knows that.

THE COURT:  He can definitely testify it's the number one selling cigarette.  He can testify about how it holds more of the market. And then you can argue, I suppose, that because it owns more than whatever percentage it is that it owns, that is going to be � the jury could take an inference from that and decide that that means it probably causes more deaths.  But I don't know that this witness can do that for the jury.  That's for the jury to decide.

MR. GDANSKI:  I know that he can from a historical perspective do that.  I've seen him

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=253
Page 3130 do it.  I know he will explain it.  I know he

can do it.

THE COURT:  Well, then the jury can � why should he be allowed to give the jury something that they should figure out for themselves?  In other words, why don't you ask him these questions about is it the leading brand.

MR. BRENNER:  He already did that, and I didn't object.

THE COURT:  That, you can ask.  All these questions about how big the brand is and how big � and also questions about rates of death in general.  Then you can argue that to the jury.  But I don't think this witness has the capability, unless he gives some sort of opinion pole or study that maybe would somehow come into evidence that would indicate that.  All he's doing is extrapolating.  He's taking, well, if they own 50 percent of the market, that must mean 50 percent of the deaths.  That's for the jury to decide.  You can argue that from inference based on the numbers, the information. It's pretty obvious that way.

I'm going to sustain the objection. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

Q    We were talking about Marlboro cigarettes for a moment.  And I'd like to just stay on that subject for a second, okay?

Marlboro cigarettes, people may be familiar with the Marlboro Man?

A    If they're old enough, yes.

Q    When did that come out?

A    It comes out in the early 1960s.  It's called the Marlboro Country campaign.  There had earlier been a Marlboro cowboy, but it was just one of several masculine images that were attached to Marlboro after 1955 when the Marlboro goes from being a women's cigarette to a man's cigarette.  And during that period there were several masculine images of sailors and things like this, but they settled on the Marlboro cowboy in the early 1960s.

Q    You said I think Marlboro has been the number one selling cigarette since 1972?

A    Yes.

Q    Dr. Proctor, how many Americans have died since 1964 from smoking cigarettes?

A    Over in the � just in the United States, over 20 million have died directly from cigarettes.

Q    Since the tobacco companies started a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=255
Page 3132 conspiracy to withhold information from the public, up to the present day, how many Americans have died from smoking cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    How many Americans have died in the 20th Century from smoking cigarettes?

A    About 30 million.  So 20 million since '64. There weren't as many � nearly as many cigarettes smoked earlier than that time.  So that adds another 10 million.  So about 30 million for the whole century.

Q    And is Marlboro still the number one cigarette today?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was Marlboro always the Marlboro Country cowboy theme type cigarette?

A    No.  Prior to 1955, Marlboro was a women's cigarette.  The slogans were "mild as May" and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=256
Page 3133 "Ivory tips to protect the lips."  There was a lot of

relationship of the cigarette to lipstick marks and things like that.  It was a women's eloquent cigarette.

Q    Over time, did it change in the type of marketing that went into Marlboro?

A    Yes.  I mentioned after 1954 it becomes a man's cigarette attached to a hard pack with a flip top box and the Marlboro Country cowboy, horses, western monument valley kind of things.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have a demonstrative PDR 245.

MR. BRENNER:  245? MR. GDANSKI:  245. MR. BRENNER:  No objection. THE COURT:  This is a demonstrative? MR. GDANSKI:  This is.  But I'm going to introduce an exhibit within it, but yes, this is a demonstrative. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, is Marlboro the number one selling product in the history of packaged goods?

A   Well, yes, in terms of I think numbers of items, yes.

Q    So on the left it describes Marlboro as a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=257
Page 3134 woman's cigarette and shows an example of ivory tips protectives the lips, right?

A    That's what it says.

Q    Then is there a middle phase of the advertisement before you get to Marlboro Country?

A    Yes.  In the late 1950s, you had this as a tattoo theme.  It's hard to see here, but the guy has a tattoo.  They would be hunters, sailors, tough guys, prior to settling on the cowboy.

Q    Then they settle on the cowboy, Marlboro Country, right?

A    Yes, in the early 1960s.

Q    Is Marlboro Country still a theme that is used today in the marketing of Marlboro cigarettes?

A    Well, it is, but the marketing of Marlboro has been restricted.  But it is still a theme, yes.

Q    If you go into a Walgreens, you can see behind the counter Marlboro Country?

A    You can, yes.

Q    Now, do you have � we have a video from within the confines of Philip Morris, an internal video, where they discuss the growth and change of the Marlboro brand.

A    Yes, a type of a brag video.  It's an internal � for internal use by the chief advertising

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=258
Page 3135 agency sort of talking about the history of the

Marlboro brand.

Q    Was the Marlboro Man a successful

advertising campaign?

A    There's no more successful marketing campaign in the history of advertising.

Q    So the Marlboro Man is the number one most successful advertising campaign ever?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    So let's play this video.  It comes from within Philip Morris, right? A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We introduced it into evidence, PT 4579C.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  So PT 45790 is admitted into evidence without objection.

Again, please keep track of that and create a list for the clerk.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's 4579C.

THE COURT:  PT 4579C.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Before we show it �

THE COURT:  When you keep track of it, also

keep track of it whether it's with objection or

without objection. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, before we show it, was this video meant for public viewing?

A    No.  It's for internal use at the Philip Morris company.

Q    Internal use in order to get the sales force to be able to sell more cigarettes?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What's the purpose of it?

A    I think it's actually the advertising company that handled the Marlboro campaign kind of bragging about the success of their job in selling cigarettes to the upper management at Philip Morris.

Q    It's about 7 minutes long, 8 minutes?

A    This cut, yes.

Q    The video itself is actually longer?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3137 A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's play that.

THE COURT:  Does counsel know why mine is not showing up here like it was yesterday?

MR. PHILIPSON:  We're going to fix it tonight.  I don't know what happened.

THE COURT:  Okay. (Thereupon, the video clip was played to the jury as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Marlboro Country, it's a special place where some men do what others only dream about and life has a flavor all its own.

Let's go back in time and take a look at how the Marlboro story developed.

Back in the 1950s, Marlboro was advertised to female smokers.  The cigarette itself was beauty tipped.  The package was white and feminine.  The copy read you need never feel over smoked.  That's the miracle of Marlboro.

But in 1954, the Philip Morris Company saw an opportunity to make major revisions in Marlboro and its image.  Times were changing and filtered cigarettes were becoming popular. Marlboro was reformulated to make it stronger, more flavorful and more appealing to male

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=261
Page 313S smokers.

To launch the new Marlboro, a revolutionary new package was designed.  The now famous flip top box.  The flip top box was bold, eye-catching, masculine.  It carried a distinctive design in red and white, which has come to be known as the Marlboro red roof.

Over the years the red roof has proved to be an outstanding logo, and it is now the most famous symbol in the history of advertising.

The move in 1954 by Philip Morris to reposition Marlboro was bold and innovative. This decision, combined with many others along the way, has made Marlboro the greatest success in tobacco history.

In 1962, the Marlboro Man had become strictly a cowboy.  He now had a clear-cut, unmistakable identity, and he had a home. Marlboro Country.  He was his own man in a world he owned.  And television and print combined with romance his rugged masculinity and the beauty of Marlboro Country.

Television advertising of cigarettes ended in the U.S. in 1971, but Marlboro made a smooth transition to print and outdoor advertising.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=262
Page 3139 This successful transition was largely due to

the depth of the Marlboro Country idea.  There's

an endless variety of Marlboro pictures.  The

life of the cowboy in the American West remains

a never-ending story, continually improving,

always presenting the look of a leader.

Over the years Marlboro smokers have recognized the quality of Marlboro in its leadership position resulting in continued growth.  In 1955 Marlboro sales in the United States were a modest 6 billion.  However, within only one year, volume nearly tripled and Marlboro's sales to smokers took off domestically.

Throughout the 1960s Marlboro sales to smokers gained even more momentum, both domestically and around the world.  In fact, total volume for Marlboro sales to smokers more than doubled during this decade.

As a result, combined sales reached 105 billion in 1972, making Marlboro the best-selling cigarette in the world.  And it has remained the leader ever since.

Marlboro is far and away the leader in the cigarette industry, and the trend is continually

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=263
Page 3140 upward.

In 1990 Marlboro sold more than 344 billion cigarettes worldwide.

In fact, today, either through Philip Morris affiliated companies or by direct export Marlboro is marketed in more than 150 nations and territories, making it the most widely distributed consumer packaged goods product in the world.

Superior marketing has played a big role in the success of Marlboro as well, as symbolized by the famous Marlboro red roof, which has become the most outstanding design in advertising history.

As early as 1954 Philip Morris's management recognized the potential of marketing a filtered cigarette.  In much the same manner, line extensions, such as Marlboro Lights, have taken advantage of changing tastes and attitudes of smokers to build the brand.  Marlboro was among the first to introduce a light line extension. This kind of aggressive marketing has paid off as Marlboro Lights has grown to become a significant part of the Marlboro business.

Here are six criteria for understanding

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=264
Page 3141 Marlboro advertising and the Marlboro Man.

First and foremost, the cowboy is the hero in charge of his life and the world around him.

Second, he is believable.  Every detail of the picture is authentic.

Third, every picture is candid.  Marlboro pictures that capture moments in time cannot be staged.

Fourth, every picture must have impact. Each one must maintain the highest level of graphic execution, without using visual gimmicks or tricks.

Fifth, there is an endless variety among Marlboro pictures in both subject matter and the handling of layouts.  Each new ad strives to be fresh and original, an unexpected combination of familiar elements.

After all these years, there is still far more to Marlboro Country than has yet been seen in the advertising.

Finally, the beauty and magnificence of Marlboro Country must be viewed as grandeur. Marlboro Country is never ordinary.

The same strength and commitment to excellence extends to outdoor, point of sale,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=265
Page 3142 and throughout the entire range of Marlboro

advertising and promotional materials.

Each piece is carefully designed to keep the Marlboro trademark strong.  This can be seen in promotions such as these, which use the famous Marlboro red roof.

In addition, Marlboro sponsors winter sports and other sporting events around the world.

All promotions must be of the highest quality.  They must be consistent with the look of a leader and reflect the worldwide leadership of the Marlboro trademark.

This, then, is the Marlboro story.  How an idea was created, then developed and extended into one of the most successful marketing concepts in the world.

It's a marketing classic that illustrates the power of innovation, taking a good idea and continually making it better.

It's a timeless story of heroic men in the world of freedom.  Like the land that stretches out to endless horizons, there will always be a Marlboro Country. (Thereupon, the video clip concluded.)

Q    Dr. Proctor, does Philip Morris need to

continue to manufacture Marlboros?

A    They chose to.

Q    And has Philip Morris � the video there mentioned a grand � a change in design at one point in time.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    Have you studied that change in design?

A    Yes.

Q    What do you know about the change in design which played a role in Marlboro becoming the number one cigarette in this country?

A    There are a couple of things.  One is the package design.  Another is the sort of schematic design, the Marlboro cowboy.  And another is the nicotine freebasing that they introduce in the early 1960s.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  How in the world did that just happen?

THE COURT:  Sorry?

MR. BRENNER:  How in � Dr. Proctor is not

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=267
Page 3144 allowed to give evidence � give testimony about

things increasing addictiveness to cigarettes,

on cigarette design without first approached the

bench.  Somehow in giving an answer to the

question about the branding of Marlboro, he

threw in that somehow they learned how to

freebase nicotine.

Your Honor, we could have a whole hearing on this about his basis to do that.  Counsel knew that he was not supposed get into any sort of design opinion.  And just out of nowhere, just in an answer to the question about how they re-branded the cigarette, all of a sudden we get an answer about freebasing nicotine.

THE COURT:  Do you want me to give a corrective instruction?

MR. BRENNER:  At this point, I'd like to move for a mistrial.  It's a violation of the pretrial orders.  Your Honor, they knew this was an issue they couldn't go into.  They absolutely knew it.  The order �

THE COURT:  Freebasing � I thought what the order deals with is ammonia being addictive.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's exactly right.

MR. BRENNER:  There's two orders.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=268
Page 3145 THE COURT:  I don't remember entering an

order about freebasing nicotine.

MR. BRENNER:  About cigarette design.  He just said � what they did was they changed the brand of the cigarette.  They changed the box.

THE COURT:  What's the order on the design? Anything violates freebase � representing freebasing �

MR. GDANSKI:  This is based on their documents.

THE COURT:  He's already testified earlier �

MR. GDANSKI:  So much.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, by the way, this is what I made the objection to before. Freebasing nicotine is among � this is why I came to you before and you said, well, I can't object to two questions � four questions ago. This is the second time they've done that.  He is going to, and he has already suggested to the jury that � first of all, the whole idea of freebasing, counsel knows the only connection to that is ammonia.  Dr. Proctor will say, if asked, he doesn't know that ammonia makes cigarettes more addictive.  The whole concept of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=269
Page 3146 freebasing nicotine is among the arguments.

THE COURT:  What does that mean, freebasing nicotine?

MR. BRENNER:  He already told you earlier. He associates it with crack.  It's called freebasing.

MR. GDANSKI: That's not the answer to the question, though. You're just going to have to prejudice Dr. Proctor.

MR. BRENNER:  He did that already.

THE COURT:  It doesn't appear that this order was violated.  Is there another order?

MR. BRENNER:  No, the cigarette design order.

MR. GDANSKI:  The cigarette design order �

THE COURT:  Is there another order?  This one is not violated.

MR. BRENNER:  This is ammonia particularly.

MR. GDANSKI:  I would just point out that we just watched a video that described the design changes in the cigarette.  This is not Dr. Proctor's wacky opinion of design.  This is from their documents and their video.  How can he not historically explain what the video just said?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=270
Page 3147 To start the argument off with the

accusations of violating orders when I did no

such thing, I certainly take exception to.

MR. BRENNER:  Let me read paragraph 10 for the record.  There's two issues I'd like to make, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I am going back to the question.  You asked him � you said, and what do you know about the change in design, and there was no objection.

MR. BRENNER:  No �

THE COURT:  You failed to object when he used the word "design."  It was after the fact. If you would have objected, I could have dealt with it.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor �

THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  The Judge is trying to talk.  You keep interrupting the Judge.

MR. BRENNER:  Sure.

THE COURT:  You guys do this to each other, but I don't want you guys doing it to me.

MR. BRENNER:  Sure.

THE COURT:  There was a question � I'm looking at the record � what do you know about

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=271
Page 314� the change in design?  If you were so worried

about this order, Mr. Brenner, if you were so

worried about this order, you would have jumped

up and said objection.  The Court have � you

could have said sidebar.  The Court could have

addressed it.

Now because the witness has answered it, you somehow have turned this into � because of your own failure to object, you have now turned it into I want to move for a mistrial.  Well, you can't move for a mistrial because you failed to object.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Let me finish.  When I finish, then you can talk.  That's the way this works.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  The same way when you both talk to each other, you wait until one finishes and the other talks.  That's the way we do this.

Now you suddenly have moved for a mistrial. I understand that you may want to move to strike it and move for a corrective instruction.  But what I'm perturbed about is that you would somehow move for a mistrial when you failed to object to a question about design.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=272
Page 3149 MR. BRENNER:  Now may I respond?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, let's re-play what happened.  He just played a whole video that's all about the design of the ad campaign, the design �

THE COURT:  There wasn't an objection to that either.

MR. BRENNER:  There isn't an objection to that.  Therefore, the following question, I have every reason to expect that this lawyer and this witness are going to follow Your Honor's pretrial order.  When he asked the questions about design, the first questions are fine.  The flip top box, fine.  The cowboy, fine.

THE COURT:  It doesn't work that way.  You can't � go ahead.

MR. BRENNER:  You have a pretrial order directly on point.  There are parts of design that are not cigarette design that are perfectly appropriate, I didn't object to.  If you listen to his answer, he starts off fine.  I don't object.  He goes on.

As soon as he gets to freebasing nicotine, which is a cigarette design as opposed to an ad

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=273
Page 3150 campaign design, which we just watched 8 minutes

of on a video, with all due respect, Your Honor,

I have not failed to object.  I have a right to

believe that they advised their witness to

follow your Court's orders.  So when they asked

a question in a way that doesn't violate your

court order, I do not need to object, Your

Honor.  I cannot be blamed because he goes

beyond the question.

THE COURT:  How am I going to get blamed? How am I being blamed for a mistrial?

MR. BRENNER:  You're not blamed for a mistrial, Your Honor.  I don't think you did anything wrong.

THE COURT:  Wait a minute, wait a minute. The question was, well, there are a couple of things.  One is the package design.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm fine with that.

THE COURT:  Another is the sort of schematic design.

MR. BRENNER:  Those are fine.

THE COURT:  If you had a problem with thinking that this guy cannot testify regarding design �

MR. BRENNER:  Cigarette design.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=274
Page 3151 THE COURT:  � that was the time to object.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, think about what you're saying to me.  They asked him a question which can be answered within the confines of your Court's order and outside the confines.  I had no basis to object --

THE COURT:  Would you like a instruction to the jury?

MR. BRENNER:  If you deny my mistrial, then I will ask for �

THE COURT:  Of course I'm going to deny your mistrial.  If you want an instruction to the jury � you failed to object.  You failed to bring it to my attention.  You failed to ask for a sidebar.  Your motion for mistrial is not well presented.  And it's denied.  What I want to know is if you want a corrective instruction regarding that issue.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, I would.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure � first of all, I haven't made a decision as to whether this doctor is able to testify about design or not. I'm still going to have to make a ruling on that, which might make your whole argument moot anyway.  I haven't even gotten to that point

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=275
Page 3152 yet.  All I've said is don't mention it until I

have had a chance to rule on it.  I haven't

ruled that it's not going to be admissible.  The

design issue might become admissible if there's

a proper predicate laid for it and if he's got

proper credentials to be able to testify about

it.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think, quite frankly, Judge, it all really is moot.  Because I have laid what I think is, and has always been every time I've tried to do this, a more than satisfactory and sufficient predicate for design.  I can do it again if Your Honor wants. In three minutes, I will lay that detailed predicate for design, on ammoniation.

But when it comes to the subject of ammonia and freebasing, the man has actually published a peer-reviewed article on the subject.  His literature, his independent studies of the sources have been so sufficiently credible as to be accepted upon peer review.  So this is a person who is of course well versed in the subject to begin with.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure, first of all, the reference of freebase necessarily is the same

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=276
Page 3153 thing as the design issue, cigarette design.  He

hadn't gone into it and explained that � the

nature of the design and how much nicotine goes

in there and the fact that it's intended to

affect your brain in a certain way.

MR. GDANSKI:  I agree with you.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure if he's really gotten into it simply by referring to freebasing.  I think everybody is overreacting, first of all.

I'd like to know what that corrective instruction is.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know that there needs to be a corrective instruction.

THE COURT:  I'm going to do one anyway.

MR. BRENNER:  I'd like you to instruct the jury to disregard Dr. Proctor's comments regarding freebasing nicotine.

THE COURT:  Anything else you would like me to say in there?

MR. BRENNER:  Not at this time.

MR.

	Can I qualify him now on

design?
	
	

THE
	COURT:
	You can attempt to qualify him

on design

	I want the witness up here.

Bring the

MR.
	GDANSKI:
	If he's qualified on the

subject,
	then the
	re's no need to do any

corrective statement.
		
THE
	COURT:
	Sir, I have entered a motion in

limine in
	advance
	that you are not to testify

until the
	Court rules otherwise about the
	
cigarette

	So do not answer any more

questions
	about cigarette design.  Do not talk
	
about freebasing.
		

Do y
	ou understand that?
	
THE

	Yes.

THE

	Okay.  You may have a seat.

Thank you

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=278
Page 3155 words that the witness indicated and used the

term called freebasing.  The witness � the jury

should disregard it, put it out of your mind at

this time.  It has nothing to do with this

testimony, and it's been stricken from the

record.  You should completely disregard it. Anything further, Counsel?

MR. BRENNER:  Nothing further, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  You may

proceed. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, as Marlboro started to grow in the market share, did the other companies take the product and reverse engineer it?

A    They did.

Q    Okay.  So which companies did that?

A    All of them did that.

Q    All of them, all right.

When the companies did that, did they actually put their impressions and writings in some of the internal documents that we have as to what they found, what the secret and the soul of Marlboro was which gave raise to its increased market share?

A    They did.

Q    From their own documents, the company's own

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=279
Page 3156 documents, what did they find was the secret and soul to the rise and perseverance of Marlboros?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection, Your Honor.

MR. FURR:  Goes to design issue, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Not your own independent conclusion, their documents.  What do their documents demonstrate as to the secret and soul of Marlboro?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 1635.

MR. FUHRMAN:  We object, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Which one?

MR. GDANSKI:  1635.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I don't know the nature of the objection.  I don't know anything about the document.  At this point, do you want to defer on it or have argument on it?  There's no agreement on it obviously.

MR. GDANSKI: No, there's not an agreement. I can lay a predicate and foundation and I think it will become abundantly clear.

THE COURT:  The objection is sustained at

	MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

BY MR. GDANSKI:
	
Q
	Dr. Proctor, I'm going to hand you � I'm

not going
	to show the jury.  I'm going to hand you a

document,
	1635.  Tell me if you're familiar with it,

okay?
	

A
	Yes.

Q
	Are you familiar with that document?

A
	Yes, I am.

Q
	Does it come from one of these companies?

A
	It does.

Q
	Which company does it come from?

A
	It's from the Brown & Williamson Company,

which is ]
	now R.J. Reynolds.

Q
	Is that an important document as it relates

to the company's internal knowledge as it relates to
	
cigarettes that they sell?
	
A
	It is.

Q
	Have you studied that document?

A
	Yes, I have.

Q
	Have you analyzed it?

A
	Yes.

Q
	Have you written about it?

A

Q
	Have
	you cited to that

for which title we cannot say the name?
			
A
	Extensively, yes.
		

Q
	Have
	you written about
	that document in a

A
	Yes.
	
	

Q
	Does
	the document demonstrate that Reynolds
	
looked
	at � I
	'm sorry � Brown
	& Williamson looked

at the
	Marlboro cigarette and tried to understand its
		
makeup
	and its
	parameters?
	

A
	Yes.
	
	

Q
	Are
	we able to look at
	that document and

learn from it
		as to what Brown &
	Williamson

concluded, not
		you, Dr. Proctor,

Williamson concluded regarding Marlboro cigarettes?
			
A
	That
	's what the docume
	nt is about, among

other things.
		
	


	MR.
	GDANSKI:  We'd move it into evidence,
	
Judge.
		
	


	MR.
	FURR:  We object.
	May we approach?


	THE
	COURT:  Yes.

pgNbr=282
Page 3159 (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Somebody want to give me the document?

MR. FURR:  Here it is, Your Honor.

The objection is that it violates the court's limine rule.  This is a cigarette design document.  It's a document about how it only affects various parameters of cigarette design. That's almost what the entirety of it is.  You notice that Mr. Gdanski did not �

THE COURT:  Whose document is this?

MR. GDANSKI:  Brown & Williamson.

THE COURT:  Who were they?

MR. FURR:  They were a company that � an independent company at the time of that document.  It has now subsequently been merged into the R.J. Reynolds Company.

MR. GDANSKI:  They're a member of the conspiracy.

THE COURT:  Why wouldn't whatever he's trying to get in here � maybe not the whole document � why would it be a statement against interest by a party opponent?

MR. FURR:  It may be.  But this witness is not qualified to testify about it.  This

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=283
Page 3160 document is about how ammonia reacts with

sugars.  It's about reconstituting tobacco

manufacture.  It's a design document.

MR. GDANSKI:  I need to make something clear, from just a grand perspective.  I understand Your Honor's ruling that I need to wait until Dr. Proctor gives his own independent scientific conclusions on design.  This is the historical record as it relates to the industry's activities on design.  That has never been blocked.  I've never been precluded from doing that.  Down the hall in as many trials as I've had in this courthouse, Dr. Proctor, regardless of what courthouse we're in, has never been stopped from talking about the history of cigarette design.

THE COURT:  First of all, how do you put this document in for this witness?  There is no stipulation.  This document cannot come in through this witness.

MR. GDANSKI:  I do it with this witness every single time.

THE COURT:  He can't authenticate this document.

MR. GDANSKI:  He can authenticate it just

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=284
Page 3161 fine.  There is not even an authenticity

objection.  That wasn't even a basis of an

objection.  There are stipulated authenticity

documents.  I can establish authenticity through

him if I need to.  That's not the issue at hand.

The issue at hand is Dr. Proctor can't talk

about design.

He's not talking about design.  He's talking about the history of cigarette design. How can he explain the history of what took place, the history of the problem, the history of the fraud and conspiracy.

THE COURT:  What is it you want to ask him about this document?

MR. GDANSKI:  This is the document from Brown & Williams that deconstructed Marlboro cigarettes and concluded that the changes in the design parameters of Marlboro cigarettes, the changes in the alkalinity and the pH gave rise to the growth of Marlboro as the number one cigarette.  This is not Dr. Proctor's opinion on cigarette design.  This is from the defendant, through my historian, who is uniquely qualified to explain this process.

THE COURT:  Why can't you simply �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=285
Page 3162 assuming you can get this into evidence, admit

this into evidence, and argue it from the

document.  Why do you need him to �

MR. GDANSKI:  Because he puts the whole thing into perspective.  He's the historian who tells the story.  This is exactly what he does in every single trial.

THE COURT:  He's going to give a history � he's going to take apart somebody else's statement?

MR. GDANSKI:  He's going to give the history of cigarette design.  He is going to give the history of what these companies did, what they knew, when they knew it, why they did it, how they did.  That's bread and butter Dr. Proctor.  Judge, I have basically put him on probably a dozen times.  It's basically the same thing every single time.  This is what this is. This is the bread and butter of Dr. Proctor.  He goes through the history of the industry's conduct.  This is the industry's conduct.

MR. FURR:  I think we should all stop the references to prior cases.  I've crossed him more than anyone.  So what.  It doesn't matter. He is not a cigarette design witness.  The

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=286
Page 3163 document speaks for itself.  The only way that

he could add to the jury's understanding of this

document is for him to provide opinion testimony

about the significance of design features and

what the companies did.

THE COURT:  What's the objection to this document coming into evidence?  I thought that was the latest problem, was objection to design � are you objecting to this witness being questioned or are you objecting to the document?

MR. FURR:  I am objecting to the witness being questioned.

THE COURT:  Are you guys objecting to this document coming into evidence?

MR. FURR:  No, sir.  I am objecting to this witness being used.

THE COURT:  You're okay admitting this into evidence?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Once it's admitted into evidence, why can't he ask a question of another witness about something that's admitted into evidence?

MR. FURR:  There was a medical record

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=287
Page 3164 admitted into evidence yesterday about bladder

cancer.  He can't ask questions about �

THE COURT:  No, he can't because that's outside of his expertise.  But he may have some knowledge of the history about when this changed over and the design change, and so why wouldn't there be � if this is a document that's coming into evidence, why wouldn't there be some appropriate questions within the scope of his knowledge that may already be asked about the history of when this changed and what happened?

MR. FURR:  Of course.

MR. BRENNER:  If I could be heard, your Honor.  We're just operating in two different sort of universes on what Dr. Proctor is.  Their position is �

THE COURT:  Only two?

MR. BRENNER:  At least two, I should have said.  Their position is anything Dr. Proctor reads becomes history and, therefore, he is qualified to testify about it.  It's as if what he's becoming, what they want him to be and what we raised pretrial, is they want him to be a document reviewer.  He is not a document reviewer.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=288
Page 3165 You're exactly right, Your Honor.  If that

document goes into evidence, the plaintiff can

stand up during closing argument and make

argument from what the document says and what

the plaintiff believes it means, and we may

argue what we believe it means.  But he doesn't

become a cigarette design expert because there's

a cigarette design document admitted into

evidence.  That's entirely inappropriate.

That's what they're trying to argue, that

because it happened in the past, it becomes

history.  That's not what he is, Your Honor.  He

cannot testify � and Mr. Furr said it exactly

right.  All he can offer about this is give

design opinions, which you've already � at

least to this point, you haven't allowed.  You

haven't made a full ruling, I agree.  But we all

agree at this point you haven't allowed it.  I

suggest we move on.  I thought we were moving on

from design after the last sidebar, but

apparently we're not.  They view anything that

happened in the past is history and Dr. Proctor

can say anything he wants about it.

MR. GDANSKI:  I do view anything that

happened in the past as history because that's

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=289
Page 3166 what history is.  When it comes to the story of

the fraud and conspiracy to conceal information

regarding health effects and the addictive

nature of smoking, this is that story.  You need

someone to tell that story.  That story is what

constitutes history.

I have no problem saying that Dr. Proctor can talk about the story which makes up the history of the story.  It's obvious.  It's what he does.  It's what he does for a living, quite frankly, and it's what he does in courtrooms. We need him to contextualize what they did and what he knows about what they did through their documents.  It is, it is exactly what he does in every single trial.

THE COURT:  What are we doing with this document, first of all?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'd like to introduce this document into evidence and then ask the doctor questions about it, exactly like I do all the time which is normal.

THE COURT:  What's your position on the admissibility of this document?

MR. BRENNER:  No objection.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=290
Page 3167 THE COURT:  So this will be � what is this

PT?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's on the bottom right, whatever that is on the bottom right.

THE COURT:  This will be admitted without objection.  Okay. (Exhibit 1635 was admitted into evidence.)

THE COURT:  You all have a seat and I'll let you know what my ruling is in a second. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  Counsel approach again. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Since this document is in evidence already, he can testify about what happened historically, but he can't give his own opinions about design.  Not give any of his own opinions about the design of cigarettes.  All he can do is state what it states in here and limit his � at this point, limit his testimony to what it states in here.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

THE COURT:  Do I need to instruct the witness in this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll guide him through it. Just give me a little leeway on leading.

THE COURT:  Bring the witness over.

Doctor, you may be asked some questions about this document.  Have you ever seen this document before?

THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes, sure.

THE COURT:  You can't give your own personal opinions about cigarette design or what you think about cigarette design.  I don't want to hear any opinions about you at this point because we haven't made a legal decision on that.  But you can testify about what it says in here �

THE WITNESS:  Sure.

THE COURT:  � and what historically occurred as far as this document is concerned, but not --

THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, I didn't understand that last part.  Heard about � what did you say?

THE COURT:  You can testify, if you're asked questions, about what the companies have said about this, what the companies themselves have said about this in this document.  But you

Q    PT 1635 for the record.  Let's go to the next page.

So at about the same time in the early 1950s, Philip Morris, PM, was also developing a band

pgNbr=293
Page 3170 cast recon.

Can you explain what those three words mean

"band cast recon"?

A    It's type of reconstituted tobacco where you take the scraps from the floor and the dust and the stems, things like that, and you crush them to make a paper-like material that comes out as a sheet. And then it's chopped up and included within cigarettes.

Q    To realize the economies of fully using stems and tobacco fines.  But PM decided to free most of the pectin in the tobacco. What does that mean?

A    Pectin is a protein-like substance that was important from the binding properties of the sheet. There was a tendency of the sheet to crumble and certain chemicals were added to prevent crumbling. One of these involved releasing the pectins to stabilize the sheet to make it malleable.

Q    Pectin in the tobacco thus producing a strong sheet.  Pectin release was accomplished by cooking the slurry with DAP. What is DAP?

A    It's an acronym for diammonium phosphate.

	and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=295
Page 3172 code words?

A   Well, part of it is because these are technical documents and they don't � it's not always obvious what the words mean.  There are other examples where certain code words are used for certain words like cancer.  One of the code words was zephyr and benzpyrene, one of the code words was worstof.  Nicotine, one of the code words was Compound W.  Different code words, sometimes euphemisms.  Sometimes trade secrets, there are different reasons to cloak, to simplify certain terms.

Q    Do we know what one of the code words for ammonia was?

A    Yeah, there were several code words for ammonia.  Ukelon was one of them.  There are several.

Q    What is root technology?

A    Root technology is a code word for ammoniation.

Q    This was done � so let's go back to this. At some point PM introduced RT, root technology. We now know that's ammonia, right?

A    Yes.

A    Yes.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection,

improper bolstering.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did you?

A    I did.

Q    You cited to this actual document?

A    That's one of the principal sources for my research for that document.

Q    The title, which I won't say, comes from what we're looking at on the screen?

A    It does.

Q    Confirmation of this conclusion is provided by PM's use of RCB in the worldwide markets wherever regulations and economics allow, while, other components do vary.  Two recent changes in PM's paper recon have been incorporation of Urea, more later, for harshness reduction.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=298
Page 3175 What's urea?

A    It's an ammonia-related compound.  It was actually historically the first organic compound synthesized and gave birth to organic chemistry, actually.

Q    And the use of propylparaben �

A    Propylparaben.

Q    � to retard mold growth.  To lessen the mold growth, right?

A    Yeah, like a fumigant to prevent mold growth on moist tobacco.  It's a pesticide.

Q    Let's go to the next page.  Ammonia as an ameliorate.  What ammonia does � RT can be used to provide molecular ammonia into smoking.  What ammonia does is it reacts with some of the known irritants in smoking and converts them into new compounds, which are not irritants.

Ammonia as an impact booster.  Dr. Proctor, do you know what impact booster means here?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection to

him � the document speaks for itself. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Ammonia, when added to the tobacco blend, reacts with the indigenous nicotine salts and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=299
Page 3176 liberates free nicotine.  As a result of such change, the ratio of extractable nicotine to bound nicotine in the smoke � just the top � may be altered in favor of extractable nicotine.  As we know, extractable nicotine contributes to impact in the cigarette smoke and this is how ammonia can act as an impact booster.

Can you explain scientifically what's going on?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  Do you have a copy of the document?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  The Judge has it.

THE COURT:  No, I gave it back.

MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor, do you have it up there?

THE WITNESS:  I have it up here.

MR. GDANSKI:  Can I grab it for a second? Thank you. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, does ammonia, based on this document, liberate additional flavor compounds, including free nicotine?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3177 MR. FURR:  Objection.  Improper opinion

testimony.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Go to the next paragraph, ammonia as flavor promoter.

As mentioned above, ammonia liberates additional flavor compounds including free nicotine from the blend.

Do you see that, Doctor?

A    I do.

Q   Because of this phenomena, such compounds can transfer more efficiently into the smoke.  This means that the same blend in alkaloid content, the cigarette incorporating RT will deliver more flavor compounds, including nicotine into smoke than one without it.

Dr. Proctor, do you understand what this all means?

A    I do.

Q   Okay.  Is that because you've studied the science behind this entire issue?

A    I have.

Q   Is that because you've studied cigarette design?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=301
Page 317� A    It is.

Q    Is that because you're an expert in cigarette design?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    Did you lecture at the FDA about cigarette design?

A    Yes.

Q    When you went to the FDA, you talked about cigarette design, you talked about the role that chemical constituents like ammonia, thiamine, phosphate, urea, reconstituted tobacco, they all play in the role that cigarettes � in the way cigarettes are designed?

A    I lecture on that all the time.  I published extensively on that.

Q    So we understand something, you've published peer-reviewed literature on cigarette design?

A    Yes.

Q    So when you publish something in a peer-reviewed paper, it has to be reviewed by peers who have the ability to reject it and say you don't know what you're talking about on this subject? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3179 BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do your papers that are peer reviewed, do

other individuals have to read them and approve them?

A    Yes, that's what peer-review is.  It's reviewed by my peers, other experts in the field of cigarette design.

Q When you published the paper on cigarette design for which the title I have here, was it peer reviewed?

A    It was.

Q    And those peers include scientists from varied backgrounds, professionals, including doctors, public health officials, scientists, individuals who have roles within the government, medical doctors?

A    Well, that's typical.  Of course peer-review is secret, so I never find out who the actual peer-reviewers are, but they're supposed to be other experts.

Q    And in doing that, is that how � is the peer-review process and publishing and lecturing and writing and being invited internationally to discuss the subject, is that how individuals distinguish themselves as having sufficient knowledge and expertise in a subject matter?

A    That's how science works.  Science works by

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=303
Page 3180 research, publication, peer-review.  That's called

science.

Q    Have you done some of that when it comes to

the subject of cigarette design?

A    Extensively.

Q    Does the FDA ask any, just, you know, person who knows a little bit about cigarettes to come in and discuss and talk to them about cigarette design?

A    No.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Argumentative and

bolstering.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm just laying a predicate. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What do you do when you research a subject like this?

A    I talk to colleagues, I read scientific articles, I read literature by other colleagues, books, articles.  I read the documents of some of the truest experts, the people within the industry who study this more than me.

Q    In doing that, do we know that, for example, reconstituted tobacco will enhance what was already present in tobacco?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Opinion testimony.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Go to the next paragraph.

As we mentioned in the introduction,

through RT, we enhance what is already present in

tobacco.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    As we all know, all tobaccos require

certain periods of minimum ages to develop full taste

and flavor potential.  During this aging process,

reactions take place that are similar to those that

occur in certain RTs.

Do you see that, Dr. Proctor?

A    Yes.

Q    Do you understand what is going on?

A    Yes.

Q    Is it complicated and somewhat technical?

A    It is technical, yes.

Q    Are you able to explain it?

A    I could, yes.

Q    Can you explain that, Dr. Proctor?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  What's the next page?

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, one of the things you talked about was the conspiracy started in 1953.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    As part of that conspiracy, did the tobacco companies block smokers in the public from receiving all of the information regarding smoking and health? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What did this industry do when it came to people becoming aware, fully aware of the dangers as it relates to smoking and health as part of their conspiracy.

A    Well, two main things.  They concealed what they knew, but they also denied what the public health community was finding out to be true.  Those are sort of the two principal things that they did.

Q    Very simply, did the tobacco industry, during the course of the years of their conspiracy, want the public to know the truth about smoking?

A    No.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=306
Page 3183 MR. FURR:  Objection as to the industry's

intent.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Based on their documents.

MR. FURR:  Same objection as to intent.

THE COURT:  Counsel approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Why wouldn't that be part of the historical information this witness can testify about?  During the course of the years of this alleged conspiracy � maybe there's something wrong with the question, but � did they conceal this to the public.  I mean, why � isn't that the whole purposes of this witness?

MR. FURR:  Yes.  That's not what I objected to.  I objected to the question.  As the Court recognized, it's the question that there's something wrong with.

THE COURT:  It assumes a conspiracy in the question.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's a finding of conspiracy.

MR. FURR:  It asks for the witness to interpret the intent of the language.  He can

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=307
Page 3184 describe the context, the actions occurring,

when they occurred, the results from �

THE COURT:  Why don't you ask him � I think you can ask him questions about how it was concealed and how they didn't want the public to know about it based on his historical account of it, but not this particular question as phrased. MR. GDANSKI:  I'll figure it out. THE COURT:  All right.  So sustained. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    A few questions before the clock ticks 6:00.  Dr. Proctor, you can put that back up.

Dr. Proctor, as part of the conspiracy, did the industry withhold information from the public regarding the ammoniation of cigarettes? A    They did.

Q    And have you, Dr. Proctor, reached conclusions and published those conclusions regarding the effect and impact of ammoniation in cigarettes? MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's improper design �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm asking if he's done the research and done the conclusions, not what his conclusions are.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=308
Page 3185 THE COURT:  So you're asking for a yes or

no right now?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  If it's a yes or

no, then the objection is overruled.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have you done studies, done the research,

reached conclusions, scientific conclusions about

cigarette design, its impact, specifically here as it

relates to ammoniation?

A    Yes.

Q    Dr. Proctor, would you be willing to share

those conclusions with this jury?

A    I would be.

Q    Has � do the tobacco � does the tobacco

industry deny that ammoniation has any impact on

smoking behavior?

A    Yes.

Q    Do we know otherwise?

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Has the scientific community, at the

highest levels of the federal government in this

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=309
Page 3186 country � what was the office you described as the top police doctor?  How did you describe it?

A    The Surgeon General is sometimes known colloquially as the top medical cop of the public health service.

Q Has the public health community at the top of the federal government looked into this issue as to what effect ammoniation has on cigarette smoking behavior? What effect pH manipulation, adding urea or ammonia, reconstituted tobacco, have they looked into the effect it has on smoking behavior?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Automatically

calls for hearsay. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have they looked into it?

MR. BRENNER:  Even that calls for hearsay. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, at any point in time, during the conspiracy of the tobacco companies, did they permit the public to know everything there was to know about the subject matter of smoking behaviors?

A    No.  The whole point of the conspiracy was to obstruct, to block, to hide, to conceal, to delay, to do everything in their power so the truth would

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=310
Page 3187 not come out.

Q    Were they effective at keeping the truth

from the public?

A    Very effective.

MR. GDANSKI:  We can break now.  It's one minute to 6:00, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

Thank you.  The witness may step down.  You will have to return tomorrow.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you, Judge, yes.

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we're going to break for the night. Tomorrow, like I said, we will be done before 5:00.  Sorry for keeping you.

I want to remind you not to communicate at home tonight with family members or anybody else or on any electronic devices regarding the case or with each other.  Do not go on any social web sites and discuss or comment on this case or ask any questions on this case.  Don't do any independent research or investigation of your own, whether by electronic or other means.

And if you can be here about 20 after 9:00, and we'11 do our best to start as soon � as soon thereafter 9:30 as possible.  We'll take a

break tomorrow, and we will be done before 5:00

All right.  Thank you.

THE BAILIFF:  All right.  Bring your notebooks. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Anything further we need to deal with?

MR. FURR:  Not for the defendants.

MR. GDANSKI:  Not for the plaintiffs.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, Judge.

THE COURT:  The issue of the � you're going to pick up tomorrow morning.  I'll ask everybody to be ready to go by 9:30.

This issue about the cigarette design, how is that going to come up tomorrow in case we need to do any follow up on that?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm guessing more of the same.  I mean, I think that �

THE COURT:  Right now you're asking about this document.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's lots of documents.

THE COURT:  You're trying to get him to testify about some sort of expertise on cigarette design.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=312
Page 3189 MR. GDANSKI:  Well �

THE COURT:  And I haven't ruled on that yet.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's really two different issues, Judge.  There's the history of � the history of cigarette design, how they were designed, how the design features were changed, what the industry did, said, knew about the cigarette design.  That is one issue that is, I think, surely within the confines of Dr. Proctor's knowledge base regarding cigarette design history.  He's a historian who's published on that subject.

In all fairness to the Court, I've never been blocked with Dr. Proctor of articulating opinions and discussions about the history of the subject. Now, it's a separate issue, which is his own independent scientific conclusions which he's published, researched on, articulated through the FDA on cigarette design. They're two different issues.

So the history of it, I'm happy to go through and read with him, read along, but I think he should be permitted to contextualize the importance of historical documents that lay

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=313
Page 3190 out the fraud and conspiracy of the tobacco

companies in general, and, specifically, as it

relates to cigarette design.

I also, however, think that I have more than qualified on multiple occasions today the witness is a true, genuine expert on cigarette design.  The FDA, which has regulatory power over cigarette design, invited him to come and tell them about cigarette design.  The Surgeon General has a conclusion in the 2014 Surgeon General's report that cigarettes are defective by virtue of their design.  It cites to him as a scientist to support that conclusion.

He's published on the secret and soul of Marlboro and the origin on the spread and denial of nicotine freebasing.  Peer reviewed.  That means other scientists who know much more about the subject than anyone in the room had to read this and said this is scientifically valid, such that it should be part of the scientific literature on the subject.  I can keep going. The guy has written "Puffing on Polonium," accepted in a New York Times editorial, more than any person has done on the subject of cigarette design, both specifically and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=314
Page 3191 historically.  His CV, which I read through over

an hour with him, is filled, filled with

references to cigarette design.  He has a whole

book that's been translated into languages and

published in other countries that deals with

cigarette design.

So to suggest that, A, he can't talk about the history of cigarette design undermines notions of history and is an example of shifting justifications.  Because I can promise you they're going to ask him questions about cigarette design.

Number two, I think he truly is qualified to talk about cigarette design independently. What he's learned, what he's concluded.  He's a world-class expert on this subject.  World class.  He's at the top of the game.  That's it. In 2014 the Surgeon General asked him to be a senior scientific reviewer for its report.  They invited him to the White House when the Surgeon General's report came out.

No tobacco company cigarette designer is going to come testify for me.  Short of that, this is the best thing in the world, in the world.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=315
Page 3192 THE COURT:  Response?

MR. FURR:  I'm not quite sure what issue is before the Court right now.  Most of that �

THE COURT: I'm just trying to figure out if I need to start looking into some issues so we can avoid some problems tomorrow.

MR. FURR:  Most of that was a waste of time.  The Court has already ruled that Dr. Proctor can testify about proper subjects regarding the history of cigarette design.  And if proper questions are asked on those subjects, we don't object.  Most of that we've already addressed.

With respect to offering pure scientific opinions on cigarette design, there's been absolutely no showing of expertise.  He does book reports.  He goes and reads documents and then he writes about what he saw and he tells other people, hey, this is what the documents say.  That's all he does.  We have not heard one statement from this witness with respect to having ever designed the cigarette, worked on a cigarette, been � taken a class in cigarette design, taken the cigarette apart, or anything else that remotely would demonstrate that he is

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=316
Page 3193 an expert on how to design cigarettes.

All he does is read what other people say and report to others � he's sort of a conduit. The industry documents say this, he reads them, he records that, and he tells other people what the industry documents say.  That's all he does. Nothing more.

MR. GDANSKI:  He does book reports that are peer-reviewed at the highest levels of scientific literature in the company which merit him winning prizes.  It's unfair �

THE COURT:  Has he ever designed � has he ever worked on the design of cigarettes?  Has he ever worked on coming up with alternatives to the design of cigarettes?  Has he ever worked on design of other products that are similar?  Does he have an engineering background?  Does he have a background in agriculture?  I mean what establishes him as an expert in designing cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  None of those things.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Let me respond, Judge, because it anticipated my thinking.  The analogy I would draw would be, in a criminal case, there may be testimony from forensic experts who

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=317
Page 3194 understand the nature of, let's say, the Mafia

and hit men, okay, who murder people.  But the

forensic experts who study it, research it, know

it, publish it and are teachers of it for law

enforcement are never themselves going to have

been hit men.

So what tobacco has done skillfully sometimes is, to try to make it seem like in order to testify about the design of a cigarette, you need to have designed a cigarette.  But because the cigarette, particularly here in the Engle cases and the Department of Justice cases, is a deadly, dangerous, lethal, defectively designed device, a lot of folks think it's unethical and immoral and would never work to design a cigarette because they are reliably lethal.

THE COURT:  I understand that he may not want to do that, but he may design other products that have the same type of skills that you would need to design this product or work on alternatives to it, work on alternatives to make them safer.  It doesn't mean that this witness has to � maybe this witness has a moral opposition to that, but it could be another

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=318
Page 3195 witness to have that.

MR. GDANSKI:  The answer is yes, he has. He's come up with alternative cigarette designs. He's advocated those designs to the FDA when they've invited him to.  I'd love to ask him about it.  I'm being objected and not being permitted to.  But he has advocated for, come up with alternative cigarette designs.  Subject to abolishing them, he advocates �

THE COURT:  Is that relevant to this case, alternative cigarette designs?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course it is.

THE COURT:  Is it that relevant?

MR. FURR:  If we had an expert, it would be.  He's not an expert.

THE COURT:  They claim that he's designed alternative designs that he's presented to the FDA.  If that's the case, why can't he testify about that.?

MR. FURR:  That's incorrect.  He's not created alternative designs.

MR. GDANSKI:  He has offered alternative designs �

MR. SCHLESINGER:  In addition to that, he has argued for, he has written for, and he has

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=319
Page 3196 been followed by the Surgeon General with regard

to the abolition of combustible cigarettes

because they cannot be made to be safe.  And

that in part is part of their defense.

So in actuality, the entirety of his career, his interaction with the federal government, the public health officials, has to do with the design of cigarettes insofar as their lethality cannot be made safe and smokeable cigarettes should be gone.

THE COURT:  That's not a design thing.  His position is that cigarettes are dangerous, so they should not be sold.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not his position.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  They can't be made safe. They can't be re-engineered to be safe.

MR. GDANSKI:  Because of the way they are designed.  But he does have a position, if Your Honor permits it, short of abolishing cigarettes he has an alternative design for the design of cigarettes, such that they would reduce the addictiveness and disease caused by cigarettes. That is 100 percent his position.  He's given that position to the FDA, and they are under � they're � right now they're thinking of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=320
Page 3197 incorporating it.  They're thinking of using it

and making cigarettes, such that the addictive

properties are so low that the smokers won't be

addicted.  They will have a full free choice to

continue to smoke or quit.  Most, 99 percent,

would quit and we'd have a 99 percent reduction

in disease.  That stems from his alternative

design theory of the design of cigarettes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  So he's a consultant to the FDA on the design of cigarettes is what John said.

MR. GDANSKI:  That for sure he is a consultant to the FDA on the design of cigarettes, but it's not just that.  He advocates an alternative actual design.  Short of, you know, cooperation � they built a construct so high when it comes to the level of cigarette design requirements that you must now work for them.  You have to have decided to no longer care about public health, no longer care about anything you've been advocating for, you have to work for them to design cigarettes.

THE COURT:  I'm sure there are ex-employees and others that might be available as experts.

MR. FURR:  Not only that, there are experts

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=321
Page 319h in the cigarette design that have never worked

for the industry.  There are people who have

worked for the federal government for various

agencies who have conducted scientific studies

of cigarette design.  They've taken them apart.

They've changed this parameter, see how that

influences whatever it is they want to study.

Then they've changed a different one.  Those

experts are out there.  They could get that

expert.

Instead, as counsel has admitted, they got a book report expert who reads about it, who has never designed anything, never tested anything, none of his designs have been built, tested.  He never has done any scientific research.

THE COURT:  This might be appropriate then for possible voir dire outside the presence of the jury.

MR. FURR:  Might be.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's do it now.

MR. FURR:  I'd like to prepare to do it.  I could be ready to do it first thing in the morning.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll never get started again.  Judge �

pgNbr=322
Page 3199 THE COURT:  The problem is that I've been

late with the jury every day.  And then if we do

that first thing in the morning � why don't we

plan on doing that at the lunch break, so you

guys be prepared to have a very short � if I'm

going to give the jury � let's say I only give

the jury a 45-minute lunch break or less than an

hour, and we do that during lunch break, that

would mean you guys might get a 2 0-minute lunch

break.  I would be prepared to have granola bars

and whatever else you might need tomorrow.  Box

lunch.

PROCEEDINGS

(Continued from Volume 22.) THE BAILIFF:  Come to order.  Court is now in session.  The Honorable Judge Edward Artau presiding.

THE COURT:  Have a seat.

Okay.  There's some issue in the jury room, so we're going to be a little bit delayed until they finish cleaning the jury room. Evidently there was a problem.

So what preliminary matters can we deal with while we're waiting for that?

MR. FURR:  We don't have anything, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well �

THE COURT:  How long is the � how long is the proffer expected to take, or the voir dire expected to take that we're going to do outside of the presence of the jury?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think from our perspective I could do it again, but I have a couple times already qualified him on cigarette design.  I'll do it again for the benefit of the Court, but it will take me about five, seven

years studying cigarette design?

Q.  Can you tell the judge, please, what you've done by way of your studying becoming extremely knowledgeable on the subject of cigarette design?

A.  Well, I've read secondary books on the topic, secondary literature, we call it.  In other words, by other scholars, other experts.  I've read tens of thousands of the tobacco industry's own internal documents on cigarette design. THE COURT:  Keep going. THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I've, as I said, read tens of thousands of documents of the tobacco industry on cigarette design.  I've drawn from my own background in chemistry and biology and the sciences, more generally, and the history of science.

I've reviewed, as I said, published literature on the topic, unpublished literature.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Have you lectured at the FDA on cigarette design?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  Okay.  And the FDA is the federal organization that's in charge of cigarette design, or regulatory � has regulatory powers over the cigarette industry?

principle.

Q.  Okay.  And is the FDA the organization that is currently tasked with implementing regulations that can have an impact on how cigarettes are designed in this country?

A.  In theory, yes.

Q.  Have they invited you to come and share your scientific conclusions with them as to how cigarettes should be designed?

A.  I have.

Q.  Do you have � have you come to a conclusion based on your research of the literature, the subject matter � well, let me back up one second.

Have you actually taken a cigarette apart, deconstructed it, and examined it?

A.  I've occasionally done that.

Q.  Okay.  And then have you written about that, what you've seen, how a cigarette is � you know, the paper, the porosity of the paper, the tobacco, the different types of tobacco used, have you written about all of that?

A.  I've written about aspects of that.  You know, I'm mainly an expert in those aspects of

disease.

The cigarette is arbitrarily complex,

and there are many different subfacets you could

go into, and my principle interest has been those

that are health or disease relevant.

Q.  As it relates to health and disease relevant facts and scientific matters, have you examined the physical cigarette, the construct of the cigarette, the design of the cigarette?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you done that once or many, many times?

A.  Many times.

Q.  Okay.  Have you � when you went to the FDA, did you share with them your scientific conclusions on how a cigarette should alternatively be designed as opposed to the way they are today?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So short of abolishing cigarettes, have you come to a scientific conclusion which you've shared with the federal regulatory authorities on how cigarettes should be designed?

A.  Yes, that authority and many others.

Q.  You've studied all � not all, but a lot of the literature from the tobacco companies and the scientific literature on the subject of cigarette design?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You've come up with an alternative design for the design parameters of cigarettes as it relates to health?

A.  Several alternative designs.

Q.  Several alternatives.

A.  Yes, by other scholars, other experts.

Q.  Okay.  How many times, Dr. Proctor, have you published in peer-reviewed literature your ideas and conclusions on cigarette design?

A.  I've been cited by other scholars on cigarette design hundreds of times.

Q.  And what does that mean to be cited, so the Court understands?

A.  It means other experts upon, use, utilize the work I've done to consider their own work.

Q.  Now the Surgeon General has cited you in the 2014 Surgeon General's report as it relates to your conclusions that cigarettes are defective by virtue of their design, right?

A.  That's true.

Q.  Okay.  So when the Surgeon General needed to pick the scholar, the scientist, the researcher who has concluded that cigarettes are defective by virtue of their design, it was you that they picked to cite for that proposition?

A.  That's true, they cited and quoted, both.

the FDA after you gave your lectures there, did any of the scientists there ever say:  Well, thank you for coming here.  We've listened to your lecture, but, you know, after thinking about it, we don't really think you're someone who is qualified to talk about cigarette design?

A.  No, they find it interesting, what I have to say.

Q.  Do you teach a course at Stanford that deals with cigarette design?

A.  Yes.  Yes.

Q.  Tell the judge about that, please.

A.  Well, I taught a course for over ten years, Tobacco and Health and World History, a central feature of which is cigarette design.  It involves looking at what are the various defects, flaws, properties of cigarettes insofar as it's relevant to concerns about disease and health.

Q.  And you teach � you have a relationship with the Stanford medical school?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is that again?

A.  I'm a professor by courtesy of pulmonary and critical care medicine in the medical school.

A.  I have.

Q.  The changes in the use of different chemicals as it relates to cigarette design?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Are you an expert on cigarette design?

A.  I am, yes, especially in those aspects that have to do with health.

Q.  All right.  Now is it mandatory for a historian of your type to understand the changes in cigarette design over the past 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 years?

A.  It's certainly useful.  Obviously, you could write a history of cigarette advertising and you wouldn't have to know much about cigarette design, though even that would be helpful in order to understand the meanings of terms like "filters" and things like that.

Q.  I'll represent to you, Dr. Proctor, that yesterday, counsel indicated that you're not an expert in cigarette design but rather you write book reports �

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Well, Dr. Proctor,

have you ever designed a cigarette that was sold

commercially for a tobacco company?

A.  No.

Q.  Explain to everyone here why not.

A.  Well, you would have to be an employee of a tobacco industry � of a tobacco company, and I've never been an employee of a tobacco company.

Q.  And just so we're clear, do you have specific recommendations as to the design parameters of alternative designs for cigarettes?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  Can the tobacco companies implement and utilize those design changes?

A.  They could, yes.

Q.  And is the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory body that has power over the tobacco industry and the design of cigarettes, are they currently evaluating what changes, if any, to make to the design of cigarettes and taking your recommendations into account?

MR. GDANSKI:  If he knows.  It's if he

knows.  If he knows the answer to that, it would

be pretty interesting that the FDA is thinking

about using his designs for future cigarettes when

this is a qualifications hearing on design of

cigarettes.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule it for this

purpose since the jury is not present.

THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it's very

hard to say what they're considering.  I've

presented them.  The people I know, you know, are

considering them, but they're pretty quiet about

their internal workings.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Are you one of the people who has presented to the FDA, as they think about the future of cigarette design, are you one of the scientists who has presented them with alternative future design parameters for cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

people who work for the FDA, are they former employees of cigarette companies who previously designed cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.  No.

A.  There are 6 or 700 employees there.  I'm not � I don't know of any who worked for � inside the tobacco industry previously.  It's possible.

Q.  Would it make sense that only a tobacco company employee can talk about cigarette design?

A.  That would be bizarre.  That would be bizarre because of the history that's led down a certain path.  The people actually designing cigarettes are not necessarily interested in health issues.  That's been part of the problem.

Q.  Have there been scientists who worked at companies like Brown & Williamson who did help design cigarettes and then afterwards, when they wanted to discuss the design parameters of cigarettes, the ingredients added to cigarettes, the industry certainly did not take that without a fight?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  There's no foundation for this testimony.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What happened to Jeffrey Wigand?

A.  He was massively harassed, intimidated. That's the pattern.  If you are a scientist who has been involved in cigarette design and come out and say how cigarettes are actually designed publicly in a way that offends the industry, they will harass you.

Q.  Did they sue him?

A.  They sued him, yes.

A.  No, they want that kept quiet.

Q.  Is that why we need people like you to help explain this process?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do you know where the ideas come from that smoking is enjoyable or pleasurable?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Can you tell us where?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Where?

A.  Well, those are themes from the advertising.  Advertising has to have different themes:  Cigarettes help keep you peppy or give

pleasure or � you know, these are themes that are

developed by the marketing departments of the

different companies.

Q.  And do we know how the themes developed by the marketing departments within the companies ultimately impact smoker perception?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What do we know about that?

A.  These are terms � these terms are then used by smokers themselves.  If you look in the 1930s, smokers will say:  Well, cigarettes give me a lift or keep me peppy.

In other words, the types of terms used in the ads are very often later used by smokers to describe their own experience.

Q.  And in following up on that, how is it that the tobacco companies, through their marketing and their messages and their conduct, have created the world in which we live in as it relates to cigarettes?

A.  Well, they're shapers of culture. They're powerful.  They're omnipresent.  The advertising is ubiquitous.  It's everywhere, and it gives a cultural sense of what it means to do

This was especially important given how

large the advertising and marketing was for

cigarettes, especially in the 1930s, '40s, '50s,

'60s, '70s.

Q.  How much money was spent on advertising and marketing?

A.  $250 billion.  That's 250, then with nine zeros, from 1940s to the early 2000s.  That's in 2006 dollars adjusted for inflation, 250 billion.

Q.  This $250 billion spent on advertising and marketing �

A.  And promotion.

Q.  � and promotion, did that cause continued smoking?

A.  Of course.  It's one of the major historical factors for the rise and the persistence of cigarette use.

Q.  And did the industry use athletes in cigarette advertisements?

A.  Very often, athletes from virtually every field of sport.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  PDR235. MR. FURR:  No objections.

over � they're competitors, but they agree that

their cigarette is Brand X, Y, or Z.

Q.  How does that message, if an athlete is smoking, if Willie Mays is smoking, if Bob Cousy is smoking, if Yogi Berra is smoking, how could that be bad for you, how does that impact smoking behavior in culture?

A.  Well, it normalizes it.  It makes it � or even better than normal, it makes it almost heroic.  It makes it athletic.

It's � obviously, there's nothing wrong with cigarettes if athletes are smoking.

we're looking at that, let me ask you a question about these ads.  We've shown a bunch of ads from the '30s, '40s, '50s.

Did any of them have any kind of warning, caution:  These things might be, are, may be hazardous?

A.  No.  No.  No.  Sometimes they would denigrate other company's brands, because, remember, there's a big break in 1953.  In the 1953 and before period, they're all competing with each other on health.

And so they would try to say, you know: Our brand is less irritating than some other brand, so there's a slight qualification.

Q.  But you're familiar, obviously, with the government warnings that at some point appeared on adve rt i s ement s ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you're smoking in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, for three full decades, during that period of time, or two and a half decades, during that period of time, is there a word of warning or hazard or danger from the government or from a tobacco company on any of these ads?

A.  No.  No, except for things like fires,

Page 3241 you know:  Close cover before striking, or:

Dispose of this package properly, but no health

warnings.

Q.  And did the ads constantly change in the imagery, the person, the wording; is there that constant freshness to it?

A.  Yeah, that was to avoid what's called wear out.  If an image is the same constantly over time, people tend to ignore it, but if it's dynamic, it excites your attention.  And that's why they would constantly change the themes.

Q.  How does that concept contrast with the warnings and the caution label on cigarettes?

A.  Well, the caution labels never changed in the periods in which they were assigned, and as a result, they essentially became invisible.

Q.  And was there wear out of the caution warning labels?

A.  There was, there was wear out.  They were repetitive, identical.

Q.  As opposed to cigarette adve rt i s ement s ?

A.  Which were dynamic, constantly changing, eye attracting, attention getting, and in color with figures and so forth, exciting themes.

No, that's fine.  Thanks,

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  So some of these are multipage documents.  We can't show every page, right?

A.  Yes, this is a published advertorial. Q.  Right, this was a document generated by American, but it wasn't publicly available?

A.  Well, yes, it's an advertisement.  It's a promotion of the American Tobacco cigarettes.

Q.  Gotcha.  So this is not a secret document?

A.  No.

Q.  But it's a company document?

A.  It is.  From the research department of

Q.  It says:  And in the cigarette, women as well as men found a more convenient, more inexpensive, and more widely palatable form of indulgence.  But probably the greatest single influence on the growth of cigarette-consumption �

I'm going to stop there. Dr. Proctor, is this written at a time of extreme growth of cigarette consumption?

A.  Yeah, it's one of the most � it's a period of one of the most rapid growths ever.

Q. � greatest single influence on the growth of cigarette-consumption has been the dissipation of the ancient prejudice against tobacco in this particular form.

I'm going to stop there for a second. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So explain to us, contextualize for us this dissipation, what that means as far as knowledge changing, evolving.

A.  Well, this is a period just coming out of the prohibition movement where remember, 15

Page 3245 different states banned the sale of cigarettes.

The last of those laws disappeared in 1927, which

is eight years before this.

So it's fairly recent that they've

overcome this prejudice against cigarettes that

had led them to be banned in 15 states.

Q.  And did the dissipation of the ancient prejudice against tobacco in this particular form and a growing belief that cigarettes being, quote, milder, than other forms of tobacco smoking are less injurious.  Can you tell us the historical significance of that?

A.  Well, at this time, one of the common theories was that it was the irritation that caused harm.  Remember I mentioned that the irritation theory is the dominant theory of cancer formation until the 1950s and '60s when it's replaced by the mutation theory.

And at this time, the different companies were competing to be the mildest, and therefore, the safest cigarette.

Q.  Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco industry, through their advertisements and statements, play a significant role in the dissipation of the knowledge regarding cigarettes?

Page 3246 A.  Yes, mass-marketing was crucial in

rescuing the cigarette from that earlier

prohibition era.

Q.  And in that same vein, did the tobacco industry, through their research labs, play a role in the manipulation of knowledge regarding health hazards of cigarettes?

A.  Yes, the creation, manipulation, adjustment, yes, all of those things.

Q.  One of the things � and so you have this dissipation of knowledge.  You talked about that.

Was there definitely publications that were saying, you know:  Smoking may not be good for you, smoking is not good for you?

A.  Oh, many.  That was central to this prohibition era movement, textbooks, you know, for kids:  Don't smoke, kids.  You know, there were all kinds of things going back hundreds of years.

Even, you know, King James, I, of the King James Bible, he hated tobacco, and there's always been an antitobacco movement.

Q.  Christopher Columbus?

A.  Well, at least there's a sentence from his diary where he says the soldiers didn't want

Q.  All right.  And Reader's Digest, you're

familiar with that publication?

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  So what was Reader's Digest?

A.  That was the � one of the most popular, if not the most popular magazine in the United States, a small format magazine with a secondary use which reached nearly a quarter of American households.

And by virtue of the fact that they did not take cigarette advertising and were quite conservative, they were very critical of cigarettes going all the way back to 1924 when they published their article saying:  Does tobacco injure the human body?

And they said:  Yes.

So they become a � kind of a lone voice in the wilderness opposing this mass-marketing and the increasing growth of cigarettes.

Q.  And we have a demonstrative of Reader's Digest.

MR. GDANSKI:  Any objection?

MR. FURR:  No objection.

Reader's Digest had 12 issues a year, 25 stories

in an issue, 300 stories a year, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And over the course of all the years despite the fact that they had an antitobacco stance, how many stories appeared against smoking and health?

A.  They only published about 36 stories altogether, 36 out of over 13,000 stories were critical of tobacco.  And the ones from the '50s were not so much antitobacco as pro filters.

Q.  Right.

There were some articles in the Reader's Digest which indicated that you should switch to filters, right?

A.  Yes, in fact, the head of Reader's Digest becomes a smoker by the 1950s.

Q.  Say that again.

A.  The head of Reader's Digest becomes a smoker by the 1950s, and he's using filters which they're thinking � regarding as a safer product.

Q.  And you referenced the fact that Reader's Digest didn't take money from tobacco

Page 3249 companies.  How did historically that matter?

Why did that historically matter?  If journals, periodicals took money from tobacco companies, how did that impact the message?

A. Well, there's a very strong correlation between whether you took tobacco ads and whether you were willing to publish articles critical to the health effects of smoking.

So many women's magazines, other types of magazines, they would � if they took heavy cigarette advertising, which almost all of them did, they were very reluctant to publish articles blaming cancer, heart disease on tobacco.

So they would cover, you know, other health effects, you know, diet or obesity or, you know, something that didn't have much to do with tobacco.

Q.  And in this period of time, the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s, were these tobacco companies profitable? A.  Extremely.

THE COURT:  Doesn't my pretrial order resolve this issue?  Doesn't it tell you that �

MR. GDANSKI:  It says financial resources.

THE COURT:  Why would you ask if it was profitable?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because financial resource is their resources today and their ability in Phase II to withstand and pay a punitive damage judgment or verdict.

I'm talking about how they made money and so they were able to use that money to put money back into advertisements and influence

THE COURT:  How is that pertinent to this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because they were able to manipulate the message by virtue of their power and their profitability.

They were able to manipulate the public health message of cigarettes and how dangerous they were, not that they were �

THE COURT:  Well, you can just say that they did advertisements.  That's all you have to say.  You can say:  This is what they did.  They did advertising.  It was false.  It was misleading.

You don't need to get into whether it's profitable or not.  It doesn't matter whether it was profitable or not profitable.

They could have taken the money out of their own pockets because they were losing money in advertising.

And you would still be arguing � even if they weren't profitable, you would still be arguing that they were misleading, that they were fraudulent, and all these things, wouldn't you?

THE COURT:  Okay.  I've sustained the objection regarding the questions regarding profitability and the answer given by this witness.

The answer given by this witness as well as the question is struck from this record. It is not to be considered by the jury.

The financial resources of the defendants are not relevant at this time in this case, and it should be completely disregarded and put it out of your mind.  It is not evidence in this case and it has been struck from the record. Please continue.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, did the companies over the, let's say, '30s, '40s, '50s, did the amount of money they spent on advertising increase or decrease?

A.  Same thing, it increased dramatically over time.

Q.  Polling data, did you review polling data?

A.  I have.

Q.  What is polling data and describe the different types of polls, awareness polls, belief polls, have you heard polls?  Tell the jury about that.

A.  Well, there are different ways to assess whether ordinary people understand harms caused by smoking.  And there are three fundamentally different types of polls which give very different answers.

If you ask just very generally:  Have you heard that smoking may be bad for you, almost everyone will say:  Yes.

If you ask more precisely:  Are you convinced or do you believe that cigarettes cause lung cancer, you get a much lower number.  In the 1950s, you'll get much less than half of smokers understanding that.

But if you ask an unprompted poller,

Page 325: it's called a top of the mind poll:  What, if

anything, do you think might be wrong with

cigarettes?

In the 1950s, only about one percent

would mention cancer.  And, in a way, that's the

most accurate representation or the most revealing

because it reveals top of the mind, what's � what

you're actually thinking about rather than, are

you trying to get the right answer.

If you suggest the right answer, if you

say:  Does smoking caused dyphesmia, you know,

half of everyone will say:  Yes.

Q.  Was there a poll done by the tobacco companies where they asked:  Does smoking cause dyphesmia?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what were the results?

A.  About 40 percent of thousands of people polled say:  Yes, smoking does cause dyphesmia.

Q.  What is dyphesmia?

A.  It doesn't exist.  It's a made-up word.

Q.  What does that demonstrate to you about the significance of a poll where you ask smokers: Does it cause "X" or:  Is it "X" or:  Is it "Y"?

Page 3259 A.  It's the problem with that middle type

of poll I mentioned.  People try to get the right

answer.  They answer what they think sounds smart.

And so if you say:  Does smoking cause lung cancer?  A lot of people will say:  Yes.

Even though it may not be on the top of their mind, they just want to get the right answer.  And so if you make up a word, they'll say:  Oh, yeah, it causes that as well.

A.  Yes.

Q. So Philip Morris hired Elmo Roper, a significant, preeminent polling company to do polls?

A.  Correct.

Q.  This poll, is this an internal poll created for and withheld by Philip Morris?

A.  It is.  It's a top of the mind poll from 1953.

Q.  So let's go to Page 43.  What harm, if any, do you think cigarette smoking does you, either mentally, physically or emotionally?

And then just tell us, you know, how this works, the total number of respondents, analyzed respondents?

A.  Well, they interviewed thousands of people, and the most common answers were it causes shortness of breath, cuts your wind, gets you out of breath easily.

And if you go down to lung cancer toward the bottom, only about one percent � about one percent volunteered that it may cause cancer, cause of cancer of the lips, cause of cancer of

polled.  And 40 percent listed no harms

whatsoever.

Q.  And the answer that's up there, the "may cause cancer," that's any cancer, right?

A.  Any cancer, yes.

Q.  So it's not exclusive to lung?

A.  That's right.  Yeah, mouth cancer had been known about much, much earlier.

Q.  And 40 percent said:  None, they just � they don't think it causes any kind of mental, physical, or emotional problems?

A.  Right.

Q.  Let's look at the whole list for a second, please.  You know, when you look at the list, it has a variety of different things that are potentially on the top of someone's mind that might be wrong with cigarettes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So can you explain the evolution of knowledge as it relates to societal thinking as to the harms as to, you know, it might be a little bit bad for you versus something like it actually causes something like lung cancer or bladder cancer?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How does the knowledge

evolve as to the levels of the harm that

cigarettes may cause?

A.  Well, the most common criticisms in the early 20th century were cigarettes may stunt your growth, cut your wind, be bad for you, in kind of a generalized way.  Cancer was rarely mentioned.

Addiction was sometimes mentioned, but not commonly, especially not after the mass-marketing really gets going.  So the harms are more minor harms.

The really big understanding of cancer, emphysema, heart disease, that comes way after World War II and doesn't even really get going until the '60s and '70s.

Q.  And why is that important when you look at, you know, any kind of information, be it school texts or newspapers back in the '20s, '30s, and '40s that might mention the harms but not the way they really needed to be ingrained, have a lasting impact?

Page 3263 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Why is this important

when it comes to how people are educated, taught,

trained?

A.  Because prior to World War II, and even after to a certain extent, there was very commonly the saying:  Well, it's bad for kids.  Smoking is bad for kids, but it's really no problem for adults.

And this, in a way, was kind of a perfect formula for kids picking up cigarettes because it made it seem like forbidden fruit.  You know, it was not for children.  It was for adults.

Wait until you're old enough.

Cigarettes were like riding a motorcycle or, you know, sex or drinking or whatever else. It was something you do as a mature person, and: It's not for you.

And that actually very often worked as an enticement for kids because kids want to be adults.  You know, they want to be an older person.

Q.  Following up on that, are there actual internal company documents which talk about kids, youths becoming smokers because they want to do something that may be perceived as inappropriate

A.  Yes, there are hundreds of documents like that.  The naughtiness is a key concept in all of this, being kind of bad, you know, and risky and � or as one company calls it, acceptable rebellion.

They've recognized and capitalized on and exploited this natural tendency of young people to rebel against authority, against their parents, and used the cigarette as a vehicle for that, to capture that rebellious tendency of teenagers.

Q.  And did they continue to do that for decades?

A.  They did that.  They've always done

that

Q.  You could say LS, and someone could finish the rest?

A.  LSMFT, or:  How far would you walk for a Camel?  These became almost universal culture.

Q.  Were there � the Hit Parade was sponsored by Lucky Strike?

A.  Yes.

Q. Okay. So what does that mean, that a show is sponsored by a cigarette?

A.  Well, it could either be the exclusive sponsor or a partial sponsor.  A TV show had to

It costs money to make TV shows and to pay for the employees and all of that, the air time, and so they would sell their advertising. And sometimes the show would be exclusively sponsored by Philip Morris or a different company.

In this case, the � you saw the big cigarette design was up on the wall of the Hit Parade.  So it's the exclusive sponsor.

Q.  And you mentioned that Philip Morris had exclusive sponsorships.  Did they sponsor the I Love Lucy show?

A.  They did.

Q.  So we have an example of that, PT577A.

MR. GDANSKI:  Move that into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection, Your Honor.

Page 3272 Q.  � tell us about that.

A.  Well, that's Johnny Roventini, sometimes regarded as the first human trademark.  He was a bellhop discovered in the '30s in a New York hotel and was hired to be the mascot or the advertiser for Philip Morris and became a cultural icon.

He traveled all around the country, met the president.  He was widely known in culture film.  He was so popular they franchised him out into five other Johnny, Jr.'s.

He was a little short guy, and he would meet children, meet people, and give out candy. But they franchised him out into five other Little Johnny, Jr.'s and he would travel all around the country, and they logged hundreds of thousands of miles carrying the Philip Morris message.

Q.  And was that tag line, "Call for Philip Morris," was that something that became popular?

A.  Yes, it became a big part of American culture.

Q.  What does it mean for an advertisement for something to have a wallpaper effect?

A.  Well, there's this sort of sense that it becomes everywhere.  It becomes ubiquitous.  You

Q.  And did that exist?  Was there a wallpaper effect as it relates to cigarette adve rt i s ement s ?

A.  Yes, it's true.

Q.  Tobacco companies used holiday-related themes in cigarette advertisements? A.  Very often. Q.  PDR239.

this is � these are ads that do not appear today,

right?

A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  So what's the historical significance of looking back and seeing that there was a time where there were cigarette advertisements that had Santa in them?

A.  Cigarettes were given.  You put a carton of cigarettes in a Christmas stocking, and it would be a stuffing, or at a party, you would bring people a carton of cigarettes.

We might bring a bottle of wine for a dinner party, but you would bring a carton of cigarettes.

For Father's Day, you'd give your father cigarettes.  If your husband was overseas fighting in a war, you'd send him cartons of cigarettes. People would give cigarettes as gifts for many circumstances.

Q.  And did all of the different companies utilize this type of theme?

A.  Yes, it was part of cigarettes being precious in the culture.

Q.  Did the industry use military themes in

its advertising?

A.  Yes, very often.

Q.  Tell us about that, please.

A.  Well, World War I, I mentioned the rations.  World War II, there's 20 times as many cigarettes given out just in 1944 as in all of World War I.

The soldier was under stress, away from home.  They could be targeted to various forms of advertising.  But also the people back at home, you would say, you know:  Cigarettes are patriotic.  The sale of cigarettes is generating so much in taxes, it's buying battleships.

And many ads would list the number of battleships and cruisers you could buy, the American government was able to buy through the taxes that had been given.

So the soldier was � those targeted soldiers more likely to smoke than non-soldiers. Soldiers often began smoking in the military because you were given a smoke break or you were given no break.

And so you were able to get a smoke

of people started.

Q.  Did some of the advertising campaigns

for specific brands change during the wartime?

A.  Yes, they changed in all times.  In other words, whatever was culturally on people's mind, they would � they were very finely tuned to that.  They had a good ear for culture, and they would play up themes of patriotism and so forth.

Q.  Was there one where Lucky Strike goes to war?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And when was that?

A.  Well, during the 1940s.  There were quite a number, even comic strips incorporated, you know, anti-access powers, themes and whatnot.

Q.  At this point in time, what percentage of males smoked?

A.  It's about 50 percent.

Q.  Okay.  And what's the highest peak percentage of male smoking?

A.  It really doesn't go much higher than that, if you count all males.  For certain cohorts, people born in the 1920s and '30s, they

Page 327 reached the highest apex, and upwards of

So it depends on when you're born,

because there's kind of a life cycle of smoking.

And, again, the people born in the 1920s and '30s,

'40s are more likely to smoke than any other

generation.

Q.  That's a fair point.

Dr. Proctor, you have biographied, you have chronicled the histories and the actions of the tobacco companies?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you done that for Mr. Shulman?

A.  No, I'm not a biographer of any one person.  I tell the story of what they did to everyone.

Q.  Do you know, for example, when he was born?

A.  I don't know anything about his biography, when he was born, what he read, what he relied on, what he saw, didn't see.  I don't know anything about his personal biography.

Q.  You don't know what he smoked, how much he smoked, when he smoked them, where he lived, anything about the man specifically?

Page 3279 A.  That's correct.

Q.  You mentioned folks born in the '20s and

'30s, and what was the highest percentage of

smoking raised for that demographic?

A.  Well, I said it was over three-quarters. For that particular demographic, by the time those people were in their 20s, early 20s, which is the peak of any year that you smoke, you start smoking in your teen years and then you sort of peak in your early '20s and then it decays over time, but for that cohort it reaches nearly 80 percent.

Q.  And in doing your work in coming here to testify, were you asked to personalize this one person in the context of the greater story of how tobacco companies affected smokers?

A.  No, I'm really here talking about the culture in general.  As I said, what everyone experienced, not what any one person experienced.

Q.  Cartoons and comic books, did the industry use cartoons and comic books in their ads?

A. Very often, especially beginning in the 1930s. Cigarettes were advertised in the Sunday funnies, there were comic strips, things like

A.  In the Sunday funnies.  These are all from post World War II.  You can tell because Lucky Strike has gone to war, meaning they took the green out.

Prior to World War II, Lucky Strike was a green pack.  And the company said they were saving war materials to aid in the war effort.

Q.  Is that true?

A.  It was not true, no.

A.  Many, yes.

Q.  Okay.  And did the AMA � what is the IAMA?

A.  That's the American Medical Association, the unifying body for American physicians, the most commonly belonged to organization.

Q.  Did the AMA, the American Medical Association, have journals that had cigarette advertisements in them paid for by the tobacco companies?

A.  Yes, all the time.  Yeah, in the 1930s, cigarette makers started advertising in dozens of different medical journals.  Most of the leading medical journals included cigarette advertising.

A.  Well, it tells you how ordinary they were, how common they were held, how understood they were as harmless.

More doctors were smoking cigarettes than nondoctors percentage-wise.  It just shows you how innocuous, how harmless, how ordinary it was thought to be to be smoking in the 1930s, '40s, and '50s.

So there are several � a couple dozen different medical journals.  And that continued on in some journals into the late 1960s actually.

Q. Can you trace for us, Dr. Proctor, the history of the relationship between the tobacco industry and the American Medical Association?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Please do that.

A.  Well, in the 1930s, the cigarette manufacturers started advertising in the main Journal of the American Medical Association.

Page 3284 They stopped that practice in 1953 with

the agreement to not compete on health grounds.

The Journal of the American Medical Association actually required that they stop advertising.

But then in the 1960s when you have the Surgeon General's report, the companies' bond together and pay the American Medical Association $20 million to buy their allegiance.

And as a result of that, the American Medical Association refused to say cigarettes cause cancer, refused to endorse the Surgeon General's warning on packs of cigarettes, refused to endorse the broadcast ban on advertising cigarettes on television, and refused to join in the collective recognition that smoking did cause disease.

And that collaboration, that paid collaboration lasted about 15 years, and it was finally undone in the late 1970s.

Q.  So the tobacco industry gave $20 million to the American Medical Association in the 1950s? A.  Yes.

Q.  Was that publicly known by everyday lay citizens?

don't know about an ordinary person, but it was

not � that part was not kept a secret.

Q.  Okay.  And in response and in exchange

for receiving $20 million, the American Medical

Association wouldn't come out and say smoking

caused cancer?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  That calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, do you think there's a relationship between receiving $20 million from the tobacco industry �

MR. FURR:  This calls for speculation. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  � and not coming out and saying smoking causes cancer?  Historically do you think there was one?

MR. FURR:  Objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, was there a relationship between the tobacco industry and the American Medical Association's position that smoking doesn't cause cancer, is not proven?

MR. FURR:  Same question.  Calls for speculation.

documents from tobacco companies that discuss the

relationship with the American Medical

Association?

A.  I've reviewed it.  I've written it on. I've given lectures on it.  I've explored it.

Q.  What did you learn in doing that kind of research?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This is a hearsay recitation of documents not in evidence. THE COURT:  Sustained.

A.  Yes.

Q.  You've reviewed documents on them giving them $20 million?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You reviewed documents on the American Medical Association's position that it's not proven smoking causes cancer after they received $20 million?

A.  Yes.

A.  Yes, it's a well-known historical fact published by many scholars.

Q.  Can you do that for us here today? A.  Yes. Q.  What is it?

A.  The tobacco industry bought the silence of the American Medical Association.

Q.  And did that have an impact on the scientific community and the evolution of knowledge?

A.  Well, of course it did.  For 15 years, the leading medical association refused to say that cigarettes cause cancer.

Q.  Did the tobacco industry have lobbying powers?

A.  Tremendous lobbying powers.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Noerr-Pennington, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Do you need a � sustained. The jury should disregard the last answer.  It has no evidentiary value and should be disregarded.

Page 3289 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco

companies have significant and important influence

in this country on all levels?

A.  They did.  The Tobacco Institute was the most powerful trade association in Washington, D.C.

Q.  And did the Tobacco Inst- � well, we're going to go through what the Tobacco Institute is, but you mentioned the term, so what was the Tobacco Institute?

A.  The Tobacco Institute was the chief instrument of the conspiracy that's formed in 1953.

It's actually formed in 1958 as an outgrowth of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

And it grows from a staff of 4 people in the '50s up to over 90 in the 1980s and '90s and was located a stone's throw from the White House at the center of corridors of power.

Q.  Did the Tobacco Institute � were they able to effectuate change at the highest levels of this country?

A.  Not just change but no change �

Q.  No change.

Page 3290 A.  � probably is more important than

change.

Q.  Why is that?

A.  Well, because they're essentially obstructionists.  They did not want many things to happen.

They did not want effective regulation of tobacco.  They did everything to block people finding out the truth, effective governmental scientific action.

Q.  Were they successful?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection. Move to strike based on Noerr-Pennington. THE COURT:  Sustained. The jury should disregard the last answer provided by the witness.  It should be put out of your mind.  It's not evidence in the case. Please proceed. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was the Tobacco Institute successful?

A.  They were tremendously successful. Q.  Who were they funded by? A.  They were funded by each of the manufacturers of cigarettes proportionate to their market share at any given time.

cost of the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  And just remind us, where were they

located?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't under- � I'll wait for them.

What the Tobacco Institute did is a historical record in fact.  They were an institute that provided money and helped lobby to create a certain cultural environment in this country regarding smoking.

Page 3292 It is a core component of the

conspiracy, like it or not.  These companies

committed a conspiracy, committed a fraud.

One component of it was to prevent the effectuation of change going forward, and one way of doing that was through lobbying efforts.

One way of doing that was through having friends on Capitol Hill.  One way of doing that was through marketing.  One way of doing that was through lying.

But I need to explore and lay out the tentacles of the conspiracy and all of its different manifestations.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, none of that makes this admissible.

THE COURT:  Pardon?

MR. FURR:  None of that makes this admissible.  The law is absolutely clear.  You cannot impose liability on a party for the lawful exercise of his First Amendment right to petition government in creation of policies that it favors, and that's all this is.  It's irrelevant.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not an imposition of liability.

On � with regard to if you can establish a question that says:  Okay.  They did this.  It was a lie, and it was a lie for this reason, that's different.

Then you can put on evidence of that, but it better be very � it better be completely independent of whether or not they made political contributions, whether or not they used their First Amendment rights.

So the objection is sustained.

years the Tobacco Institute remained in business,

was it a stone's throw from the White House in

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  So astronauts,

just how important were they in society back then?

A.  They were cultural heroes.  The Soviets had gotten into space first.  There was a space race on, and in the late 1950s, it was � these were cultural heroes.

Q.  Did they have to be healthy?

A.  They were the fittest of the fit.  They were incredibly fit.

Q.  And when they appeared in � let's go to Page 25 of this magazine.

When they appeared in Life Magazine, did it show them smoking?

A.  It did.

Q.  All right.  So how many of the astronauts were smokers?

A.  Four of the seven, preparing to go into space.

Q.  And the people who had primary control at Mission Control, those were the smartest guys at NASA?

A.  They were smart.

Q.  Smart.  Many of them also smokers?

smoked

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  Julie London, and what are we going to see here?

A.  This is Julie London, who was kind of a blonde bombshell in the mold of Marilyn Monroe from the '50s.

And she is here in the 1960s advertising Marlboro cigarettes, and she � again, it's the suggestive gesture.  Notice, you know, the cigarettes that touch each other at the tips.

A.  This is Winston.  This is after the Surgeon General's report, so there's much more humor involved than the pre '64 themes, and it's the Winston brand.

Q.  Okay.  Let's take a look, please.

A.  Well, it's making � it's the light touch that was put especially after the '64 Surgeon General's report when the government certified cigarettes as causing cancer.

There's an effort within the industry to make light of this, to add humor, and so they do this in many different contexts.

Q.  And was it effective doing that?

A.  It was very effective.

A.  The Flintstones originally was a comedy or a cartoon that was shown at 8:30 at night after Casper the Friendly Ghost, and it's modeled on The Honeymooners with Jackie Gleason, and it was advertised as the first adult cartoon.

It was a family show that was, as I said, shown in the evening.  And in the first series � or the first season, it was sponsored by Winston cigarettes.

And it shows Barney and Fred as basically naughty boys hiding from their wives basically behind the garage smoking cigarettes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We move into evidence PT570A.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  All right.  So that's admitted into evidence without objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, The Flintstones were seen by kids, right?

A.  Yes, it was a family show, and it's shown in the evening, family time.

A.  That's the RJ Reynolds Company.

Q.  Very good.  Let's take a look.

VOICE:  Hey, I've got a better idea. Let's take a Winston break.

VOICE:  Yeah, Fred.

VOICE:  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  A couple of things. Number one is, can you contextualize that for us within the confines of presentism we talked about yesterday?

A.  Well, that would � you'd never see something like that now except on like YouTube. It would be illegal now.  It's no longer allowed after 1971 to have a commercial on television at all like this.  But even the industry itself pulled back from that particular type of � type of ad.

Anyway, that's the � they also sponsored other products, but it's an example of

Page 3307 how ordinary it was to smoke.  It was consistent

with a cartoon in 1960.  It was not widely thought

to be something that was bad.

Q.  And in the commercial, do you see where

it said that � a pure white filter?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So cigarettes had filters, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Some did?

A.  Yes, most � almost all of them do now, so-called filters.

Q.  So-called filters.  Why do you say "so-called filters"?

A.  Well, because they're not really filters.  There's no sense in which they actually filter.  They don't take anything out that would not be taken out if you didn't have a filter.

That's why they're really not filters at all.  In other words, if you have any regular cigarette without a filter, it will concentrate toxins in the front end of the cigarette.

But that's true whether you have a so-called filter on or not.  It doesn't matter. Tobacco filters as well are as badly as a so-called filter made from cellulose acetate.

A.  It's just a � it's a gimmick.  It's like a seat belt made of spaghetti.  You know, it's just fake.  It's an illusion.

Q.  And in the advertisement, it says a pure white filter?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why are they white?

A.  Well, there was a longstanding effort to make them white so they would turn dark when they were smoked to make it look like bad stuff was being trapped, and they emphasized that.

Q.  Do they have to be white?

A.  No, they don't have to be white.  They could be black.  They could be red.  They could be any color.

They bleach them. They add titanium dioxide, various things to make them white and make them darken when smoked.

Q.  Marlboro has always been a filtered cigarette?

A.  Yes � well, no, it actually � it was � it had tips before '54.  They weren't really filters.

evidence now, and let's take a look at it.

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  You get a lot to life with a Marlboro, filter, flavor, flip-top box.  A man who knows smokes Marlboro.

A man who knows filters knows that cellulose acetate is the modern effective filter material for cigarettes.

This is the unfinished cellulose acetate that goes into the filter of just one Marlboro, and these finely-spun filaments smooth out the smoke and round out the taste.

The man who knows tobacco knows the importance of flavor, knows that Marlboro's long, white, smooth ash is the sign of great tobacco, visible evidence of Marlboro's pride recipe and exclusive design.

Yes, from the exclusive Marlboro filter and the mild burning tobacco, you get a big, friendly flavor with all the mildness a man could ask for.

Page 3312 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So what is cellulose acetate?

A.  It's a plant fiber, a type of plasticized plant fiber that's used in almost all cigarettes.

Q.  Does putting some cellulose acetate in a cigarette make it any safer?

A.  No, it doesn't.

Q.  What do we know, Dr. Proctor, as to whether or not filters, so-called filters on cigarettes, increased or decreased the harm associated with cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's improper expert opinion.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Historically, have there been � have you examined and looked at and published on changes and trends in smoking behaviors and disease as it relates to changes to filtered cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What have you seen?

A. Well, the death rate does not go down. Many people had hoped and thought that the rate would � the death would go down with filters

Q.  And are there certain kinds of cancers

that are specifically linked to changes in

cigarettes and filters?

A.  Yes, adenocarcinoma of the lung is more common with filters than with nonfilters.

Q.  It's been described as filter cancer? A.  Yes.

Q.  So the companies, they advertised filters like crazy, right? A.  They do.

Q.  Okay.  They do and they did, right? A.  They do and they did, yeah, mainly earlier.  They don't do that so much anymore. MR. GDANSKI:  PDR2 3 7. MR. PHILIPSON:  327?

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. FURR:  Well, again, I think the

procedure we adopted, Your Honor, is that we're

not objecting to the demonstrative, and we will

subsequently review the individual ads that they

submit to us and determine then whether there are

any objections.

THE COURT:  All right.  So we'll defer

on that.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So let's just take a

look at this demonstrative.

All right.  So this is several different

filters brands.  Dr. Proctor, in '30s and '40s,

what percentage of the market was filtered?

A.  Less than one percent.  There was only

one real brand in the U.S. that had a so-called

filter.  That was Viceroy introduced in 1935.

Q.  By 1955 into 1960, how did the filter

market change?

A.  Well, it goes from about one percent in

1950 to over half by 1960.

Q.  And currently today, what is the

A.  It would be on the order of 98, 99 percent.

Q.  So you have Marlboro on the top left: With the new improved Marlboro filter.  You have next to that:  Viceroy gives you 20,000 filter traps, right?

A.  Yes, again, this is part of the tattoo emphasis on the first one.

MR. GDANSKI:  The first Marlboro, Rob, show that one for a second. Thank you.

THE WITNESS:  This is the tattoo theme we saw in the last video.  That's before the Marlboro cowboy.  This is just making the transition to the Marlboro cowboy.

And then the next one is typical for the 20,000 filter traps.  The different companies competed to say they had the most effective filters, the most scientific filters, and then this one is saying:  Why don't they put Lark � I think it is.

Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Yes.

A.  � Lark's gas-trap filter on me?

Q.  It says:  It's not such a dumb idea. Modern sciences uses a special type of charcoal granule to clean air.  Lark's gas-trap filter uses a special type to clean smoke.

A.  Right.  Some companies say that they could actually make it clean- � the cigarette smoke could be cleaner than outdoor air with the filter.

MR. GDANSKI:  Take that down one second, Rob.

environment that led to the increase in filtered cigarettes?

A.  The rise of dramatic health fears attached to smoking.  The scientific consensus that smoking is causing mass death emerges right at this time in the mid 1950s.

And it's a response to that, that new science, the epidemiology, the animal experiments, and so forth, that the industry started pushing � that the separate companies started pushing filters.

Q.  In the marketplace, so when it comes to market share, selling their cigarettes, are these industry � is this � are these companies fierce competitors ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  When it came to the collective denial that anything was wrong with cigarettes and the case wasn't proven, were they collaborators and conspirators ?

A.  They were.  That's an important point. The conspiracy is not and everything conspiracy. It's about denying the health harms of smoking.

And apart from that, they remained competitors.  They each wanted to make the most

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco

industry become concerned about falling smoker

rates?

A.  Falling what?

Q.  Falling smoker rates.

A.  Well, they became concerned about people quitting.  In the mid 1950s when the animal experiments are conducted, there's a dramatic drop in consumption by over 20 billion cigarettes per year, and it's in response that they formed the conspiracy, they start making filters, things like that.

Q. And just back up to the front page so we know where we are and what's going on here. This is in attendance, Mr. Hanmer, from what company?

MR. PHILIPSON:  Nettled.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  � nettled and said: The industry already recognizes the need for its removal because they are making filter tip cigarettes.

I said:  I beg your pardon.  The industry is not making filter tip cigarettes.  The two largest members of the industry do not have them, and filter tip cigarettes were made, not because of the recognition of any hazard to the smoker, but because the publicity emanating from the medical profession linking cigarette smoking with cancer gave some of the smaller companies an opportunity to promote the sale of filter tip cigarettes, making use of therapeutic claims, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Did they do that?  Did they successfully make use of therapeutic claims as it relates to filters?

And he produced an internal secret report for the industry in 1953 on that topic, and then a little bit later that same year right after the meeting at the Plaza Hotel, he produces a disclosure of invention.

This is a secret document.  It's not published, but it's prefatory to a patent, and he makes comments about the importance of � or the possibility of adding chemicals to the filter that would color change and darken to make it look like filters were taking poisons out of the smoke.

Q.  And so it's 1953.  It's called Disclosure of Invention, and it's from the Reynolds company, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now this is a secret document never meant to see the light of day, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Subject:  Filter Tip Materials Undergoing Color Change on Contact with Tobacco Smoke.

I have observed, and believe it to be generally true that the cigarette smoking public attaches great significance to visual examination of the filter material in filter tip cigarettes after smoking the cigarettes.

So what's going on here?

A.  Well, he comments that people like to look at it before and after, and they like to see that it's darkening because it looks like it's trapping poisons that wouldn't go into your lungs.

Q.  Has that historically been true, based on studies, that people, when they have a white tip at the edge of the filter, when they see something there, it gives you the impression that: Hey, it's blocking something bad?

A.  That's the impression that's created.

Q.  Do these filters block effectively anything bad from getting to the smoker?

A.  They don't block anything that would not be blocked in an identical fashion by a nonfilter.

Q.  Is this cigarette with a filter just as deadly, if not more deadly, than this cigarette without the filter?

A.  It is, yes.

Q.  Because the smoking public attaches significance to this visual inspection, the possibility of incorporating chemicals into filter tip materials that would darken or otherwise change color on contact with smoke appears attractive.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  While use � let's drop down to the bottom.

While use of such color change materials would probably have little or no effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip material � what's that mean?

A.  That it wouldn't be any safer.

Q.  � the advertising and sales advantages are obvious.

A.  Right.

Q.  Okay.  And it's signed.  It has witnesses and signatures because it is a patent, right?

Dr. Murray Senkus on the bottom left and also

signed by him, number three, as a witness.

Who is Murray Senkus?

A.  He's one of the top chemists in the research department.

Q.  Now, Dr. Proctor, was this specific patent ever implemented by Reynolds?

A.  No, not that we know.

Q.  But were features, were aspects of what it discusses put into place by the tobacco companies?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Tell us about that.

A.  Well, they did � as we've talked about, they made cigarettes whiter.  They bleached them and made them white so they would darken.

Q.  And Claude Teague � this is 1953 when he started working there � did he go on to have a long, lucrative career at Reynolds?

A.  He did.

Q.  Did he rise in the ranks?

A.  He did.

Q.  Did he write on subjects as diverse as

manipulating filters, advertising youth smoking, smoking causing cancer?

A.  Many topics like this, yes. Q.  Do you know what compensation is when it comes to smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is compensation?

A.  It's the principle thing that defeats the so-called low tar or light feature of a cigarette.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Yep.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, we have, again, a motion in limine directly on point.  If you look at his last answer, I thought he was going to talk about filters, but he immediately went to light and low-tar cigarettes.

I'll show Your Honor your Order Number 26, which counsel assured us Dr. Proctor had been advised of.  I don't think it could be any more on point.

THE COURT:  This is defendants' motion

low-tar cigarettes is deferred until trial.

There's not to be mention of this evidence, including during voir dire and opening statements, until the Court has made a ruling outside of the jury's hearing.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase as it relates to filters.  It doesn't make a difference.

I can lay the predicate.  I mean we're in the � lights and low tars are a significant part of the story and the fraud of the tobacco companies.

You can't excise it out from what took place.  I can go through that with Dr. Proctor right now and lay that out.

Compensation applies to filtered cigarettes as well, so I can just tell him to stick to as it relates to filters.

THE COURT:  But he can't get into light or low-tarred cigarettes until we've had a ruling on it or we've done that outside the presence of the jury.  But you can ask other questions.

Is there � did the witness give � he already gave an answer on this?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

THE COURT:  You're not going to get into lights and low tars until we've done this outside the presence of the jury.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I've sustained the last objection.  The last answer that the witness gave should be disregarded by the jury.  It is of no probative value.  That should be put out of your mind.

All right.  Proceed further.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Following up on compensation, how does that relate to filtered cigarettes and changes in smoking behavior as it relates to filtered cigarettes?

Page 3330 A.  Well, it's the principle reason that

filters are no safer.

Q.  Okay.  Why?  What is compensation that

makes it the principle reason that filters are no

safer?

A.  Because it references the fact that if you're addicted and you're smoking for a certain level of nicotine, you can achieve that, you know, fairly easily regardless of the specific design of a cigarette.

And that means that you will tend to compensate.  If you were to shift to a so-called low-delivery cigarette, it's very easy to just puff harder, hold the puffs longer, inhale deeper, that sort of thing, which defeats the machine-measured delivery.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, move to strike the last part of his answer again.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained.

The jury should disregard the last � the answer that the witness just gave.  It's of no value and should not be considered or should be put out of your mind.

Ask your next question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

fact that makes it clear that filtered cigarettes

are no safer than regular �

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Tell us again without referencing the word "light" why exactly it is that compensation defeats filtered cigarettes as being any safer.

A.  Because the product is �

MR. FURR: Well, objection. It's cumulative. He did just tell us this, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  They moved to strike his answer.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It's called elasticity. The cigarette is sufficiently elastic that a broad range of toxins can be absorbed just by varying your behavior, by using the product more intensively.

And that's why filters are no safer, because you can easily pull through as much as you want.

Page 3332 And for a smoker who requires a certain

level of nicotine, they can achieve this, and so

it defeats the design feature that was supposed to

have made them safer.

If cigarettes � if the smoker was not

addicted, then they could be safer, but since most

smokers are addicted, they compensate, they

titrate the amount of nicotine required.

And that means they get just as much

poison into their lungs, and that's why some

cigarettes advertised as safer were not, in fact,

safer.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And is this an unconscious process, where you can titrate and you can compensate?

A.  It's unconscious, yes.  You're achieving a certain level of nicotine and you're not necessarily aware of that or understanding that. You just do it because your body needs it.

Q.  And has � has the community analyzed why smokers were switching at these rapid rates to filtered cigarettes?  I mean what was it?

A.  Which community?

Q.  The public health community, scientific community.

A.  They were fearing for their lives.  The new evidence was coming out and widely publicized

Page 3334 in the '50s that cigarettes were a major cause of

death.  This was reported in virtually every

newspaper, television, on the radio.

Millions of people started quitting in

the 1950s, but millions of those who did not quit

shifted over to filters believing they would be

safer, which unfortunately they were not.

Q.  And is that part of the reason that we've had increasing disease and death rates over the last 50 years?

A.  That's why the disease rates keep going up and up, yes.

Q.  And who was it, Dr. Proctor, that started and pushed the message of:  Filtered cigarettes will trap and will keep some of the gases and make cigarettes safer?

A.  Those were the manufacturers of the product.  They were the ones who put forward not just the filter but the illusion of the filtration as well.

Q.  And because those messages were put out, did people needlessly get sick and die?

A.  That's true.

Do not discuss this during lunch among yourselves, with anybody else.  Don't do any independent research.  Don't use any electronic devices about the case, and don't go on any social websites and post anything about your jury service here or this case or the issues involved in this case .

And we'11 take the proffered � or the voir dire of the defense of this witness, and then we'11 proceed.

If we have enough time, we might consider voir diring on some of the other issues that have come up this morning, but I do want to get started probably with them about 1:00.

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir. THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead. VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MR. FURR:

Q    Good afternoon, Dr. Proctor. A    Good afternoon.

Q    My name is Jeff Furr.  You and I have had the pleasure of having these types of conversations many times before? A    Yes, sir.

Q    Sir, with respect to what you know about cigarette design, is it fair to say that the primary way that you have learned about cigarette design is to study the documents contained in the archives of the tobacco companies?

A    That's certainly one of the most important but I've also read external literature as well so it

witness?

THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Here you go, Dr. Proctor.

A    Thank you.

Q    I've handed you a copy of a transcript of a

deposition you gave in a case called Whitney in 2015,

correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Let me ask you to turn to page 46 and look

at line 22 through 47, line 6.  Tell me when you're

there, sir.

MR. GDANSKI:  What's the page again?

MR. FURR:  46, line 22.

THE WITNESS:  Right.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, is it true that during your � of

course you were under oath in the Whitney case,

right ?

A    Yes.

asked this question and gave this answer:

Page 3343 And how did you learn about cigarette

design?  Question.

Answer:  By studying the ways in which

cigarettes are designed in the archives.

A    Right.

Q    There is an immense body of archive material, literature in the archives about cigarette design, that's what I've studied intensively, the actual practices, specifications, procedures, methods used in the industry to make cigarettes.

Did I read that correctly? A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Also read 16 through 22?

THE COURT:  Under the rule of completeness, is that the objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's no jury, I can just read it to you, Judge.

MR. FURR:  Sure.  Go ahead and read it.

MR. GDANSKI:  The question is:  Have you ever taken any formal education in cigarette design?

I studied cigarette design.  I teach formally cigarette design at Stanford.  I don't take courses in the topic.  I teach courses on the topic.

Page 3344 MR. FURR:  Anything else?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's it for now.

BY MR. FURR:

Q   So you've never taken any courses in cigarette design, have you?

A    Yes, I'm not even sure I've ever heard of actual courses on cigarette design.

Q    In fact, one of the things you told this jury yesterday when Mr. Gdanski asked you what you do when you research a subject like this is, you said, I talk to colleagues.  I read scientific articles.  I read literature by other colleagues, books, articles. I read the documents of some of the truest experts, the people within the industry who have studied this more than anyone.

Do you remember that testimony?

A    Yes, I do.

Q    I want to talk with you next about the types of disciplines that the individuals whom you have labeled as the truest experts have, okay?

A    Yes.

Q   Because based upon your historical review of tobacco company documents, you have become familiar with the identity of individuals that have been involved in designing cigarettes within the

Page 3345 tobacco industry over time; is that correct?

A    Yes, recently.  I'm more familiar with the older ones because most of the fundamental designs go way back before these recent people.

Q    And in familiarizing yourself with the individuals that have been involved over time in cigarette design, I assume one of the things that you have noted is the educational background or field of scientific specialty of certain individuals involved in cigarette design, correct?

A    That's true.

Q    And I'm speaking both about scientists who work for Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds and its predecessor companies, okay?

A    Yes.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that the individuals involved in cigarette design in those entities have included people with Ph.D.s in organic chemistry?

A    Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I would object.  This

has nothing to do with his qualifications, what

other people might have done. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Individuals involved with those entities

Q

A
	Presumably, yes.

Q
	You don't dispute any of that, do you?

A
	No.  The industry has hired literally

hundreds
	of scientists for many different purposes.

Q
	Hundreds of Ph.D. level scientists in the

hard sciences have worked on cigarette design over
	
the decades, correct?
	
A
	Sure.

Q
	All right.  And it's probably clear you

advanced degree in any of those types of sciences, do

you?

A    That's true.

Q    Following up on a couple things yesterday. Sir, you don't have any type of education degree in agriculture, do you?

A    No, I'm not a farmer or a farmer scientist.

Q    You don't have any type of degree in any of the fields that studied the way in which tobacco is grown, correct ?

A    That's correct, yeah.

Q    Now, with respect to your involvement with the FDA, can you identify for the Court the types of scientists at the FDA that have been charged with, as you described it today, the future of cigarette design?

A    Well, I guess the most important is Mitch Zeller, he had some type of nicotine research background, pharmacology, does things like that. There's several hundred people there, and I don't know very many of them, but I think they have a varied background, statisticians, different types of degrees.

	the types of sciences that I just identified a moment

	ago when reciting the educational background of

	cigarette designers in the tobacco industry?

11
	But is the FDA employing any historian to

12
	help it design cigarettes?

13
	A    Not that I know, except for the fact they

14
	did bring me in to help them.

15
	Q    Yes, sir.

16
	Okay.  Now, I want to talk a little bit

17
	more about what you have actually done.  Obviously

18
	you have read a lot of documents related to cigarette

19
	design, right?

20
	A    Yes.                                          1

	Q    No one disputes that.

22
	But have you ever designed a cigarette that

	has actually been made?

24
	A    Not really.  I have proposed designs, and

Page 3349 developed designs that were quite similar to my

proposals.  So both of the key design proposals that

I've proposed that would be safer cigarettes, namely

a cigarette with a profoundly reduced nicotine

content and a noninhalable cigarette, both of those

have not only been proposed but actually made by the

actual manufacturers.

Q    Okay.  Well, that's one of the points I was going to get to later.  We'11 go to it now.

With respect to dramatically lowered and increased nicotine content, that is an idea that has been considered with respect to how cigarettes should be designed for 50 or 60 years at least, right?

A    Even more, yeah, going into the 19th Century, the very first nicotine-free cigarette efforts go back to the 1800s.

Q    Obviously not an idea that you originated?

A    Not at all, no.

Q    This issue of how inhalability is important with the way cigarettes are designed has also been something that has been studied and talked about for a long, long time, correct?

A    You're exactly right.

Q    Again, obviously not something that you originated or developed, right?

Page 3350 A    No.  You can find clear documents in the

1960s, for example, that say, no inhalation, no lung

disease.  Then there were several efforts at Philip

Morris and elsewhere to make noninhalable cigarettes.

So you're quite right about that.

Q    Thank you.

You don't have any patents in cigarette design, do you?

A    I don't.

Q    Never applied for one?

A    No.

Q    Have you ever designed any type of highly engineered consumer product that has been made for consumers?

A    No.

Q    Other than your recommendations on cigarette design that you've told us about, have you ever made any recommendations to entities regarding the design of highly engineered consumer products?

A    Apart from cigarettes?

Q   Yes.

A    No, of course I have done quite a bit for cigarettes.

Q    Sir, you have never performed any chemical or analytic tests on actual cigarettes, have you?

A    Only trivially, some simple experiments, you know, with the flotation of the different types of tobacco in the rod.  I've done some measurements of changing mass over time because that's important for the whole low tar thing, but apart from those, no.

Q    Sir, as I understand your prior testimony, tell me if I've got this wrong, okay.  With respect to the actual testing of cigarettes, your experience is limited to one project where you did some measurement of the amount of tobacco in the cigarette rod, correct?

A    That's the main one, yes.

Q    Okay.  But back to my question.  Have you ever done any chemistry testing on cigarettes?

A    Not personally, no.

Q    Okay.  Have you ever performed any toxicological testing on cigarettes?

A    No.  Again, that's the type of thing I review, the scholarship to create my own synthesis.

cigarette smoke or any toxicological tests on

cigarette smoke?

A    No.

Q Same question for additives in cigarettes. Have you performed any type of scientific experiment on the additives used in cigarettes?

A No. Again, that's what I rely on the work of other scholars to get my information.

Q    Sir, have you performed any scientific test or experiments to evaluate the way different design changes would affect the amount or speed with which free nicotine is delivered to a smoker?

A    No.  Again, that's something I review and synthesize myself.

Q    Have you performed any scientific test or experiments to determine the amount � the way in which changing different cigarette design attributes would affect the pH of a cigarette?

A    No.  There's extensive literature on that already.

Q    You did tell the jury a bit about the way curing methods can affect how sugars are trapped within the leaf, correct?

A    Correct.

sugars in a leaf?

A    No, again, I rely on other experiments by others to produce that synthesis.

Q    Have you performed any scientific tests or experiments to evaluate the way changing different design attributes of a cigarette would affect the amount of toxins that a smoker is exposed to?

A    Not directly, no.

Q    Have you performed any scientific experiment or test to determine whether changing any specific attribute of a cigarette would alter how addictive that cigarette is?

A    No, no.  There's a huge body of scholarship, I don't need to replicate that fact.

Q    Have you performed any scientific tests or experiments to determine whether � to determine how changing a specific design attribute of a cigarette would affect the dangerousness of that cigarette?

A    No, not directly.  That's a synthetic project I do as a result of combining the work of dozens of other scholars.

A    Yes.

Q    And you have synthesized and analyzed what you found in the work of others, right?

A    Yes.

Q    You've written about that?

A    That's correct.

Q    With respect to all these consultations that you've made, what you've done is, you have then provided to others at their request your assessment of what the scientific literature shows, correct?

A    That's one of many things I've done.  I have done that.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

BY MR. GDANSKI

Q   Dr. Proctor, every single one of the subjects that Mr. Furr asked you, if you haven't done those specific things, have you studied, analyzed, or published on nearly all of those as they relate to cigarette design?

A    Yes.

Q    In peer-reviewed publications by other scientists, who you don't know but who are sufficiently competent that they were elected to peer-review committees, had to assess your ability to comment on the subject in the scientific literature?

A    Yes.  Not only that, I've peer reviewed for them as well.

Q   That was my next question.  When it comes to other people, scientists like chemists or analytic chemists, I think or an astrophysicist talking about cigarette design, have you acted as a peer-reviewer for those people when they've published on cigarette design?

A    Yes.

Q   Have you offered criticisms, comments �

A

Yes

Q    Have they taken those into account in their peer-reviewed publications?

A    I think so.

Q    Have you studied the entire breadth of the history of cigarette design as best as you can from the documents of the tobacco companies?

A    Well, that's one of the main sources, yes.

Q    Okay.  So do you know, just so the Court understands, what the documents from the companies, as part of their conspiracy and their conduct, reveal as to the design of cigarettes?

A    Yes, I know an immense amount about that.

Q    You've published about that many, many times?

A    Yes.

Q Have all of the people who are working at the FDA on cigarette design, have they published on cigarette design in peer-reviewed publications?

A You know, there's 600 people that I don't know about all of them.

Q    Do you think every single one did?

A    I would be surprised if all of them did.  A lot of them are not scholars or researchers like I am, not all of them have published.

Page 3357 Q    Exactly.  Can you explain for the purposes

of this analysis how one becomes an expert in a

subject matter?

A    You study things as deeply as you can.  You spend years doing it.  You're trained.  You publish, you demonstrate your credentials, and then hopefully others rely on you.  Because if you're an expert and no one pays attention, then in a way you're not an expert.  So, for example, the � a lot of the industry's experts people in the public health community might not pay attention to but the things I write a lot of people pay attention to.

Q What does that mean as it relates to your true ability to discuss the concept and the history of cigarette design?

A    Well, it means that I am an expert in this area.  There's also the conflicting problem of a lot of the industry's experts have been part of an enterprise that's not been fully forthcoming with the truth.

Q How does that relate to your knowledge on the industry's scientists on cigarette design?

A    Many of the industry's experts are not up to date with the best scientific literature about whether low tars are safer, whether filters are

Q    Are you up to date on that?

A    Yes.

Q   Because you're an expert on cigarette design?

A Because my job is to find the truth. One of the main areas in which I've sought the truth is in cigarette design.

Q    Dr. Proctor, as best as you're aware, tell this Judge how many days you've testified in Engle progeny or tobacco cases generally.

A    On the stand nearly 100 times.

Q    One hundred times.

As best as you're aware, from the witness stand, have you ever been stopped in court from discussing the history and science behind cigarette design?

A    Well, no.  I mean, there is lots of objections.

Q   Yes.

A    They try to stop me.

Q    Sure.  Subject to specific questions and objections, have you ever been totally stopped in a court, as best as you can recall, I understand it's a

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

BY MR. FURR:

Q    I want to go back to this idea of the availability of other individuals who testify on cigarette design.  Do you know who Dr. Jack Henningfield is?

A    Yes.

Q    Who is he?

A    He is a pharmacologist, a nicotine researcher, a member of the Society for Research into Nicotine who has testified on behalf of plaintiffs in litigation, member of Pinney Associates, and he's also served on TPSAC for the FDA, the Board of experts, the scientific advisory board responsible

correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I'm going to object. Who cares about what some other witness does? What does that have to do with Dr. Proctor? THE COURT:  Overruled. MR. FURR:  I'll tie it up. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Correct?

A I don't know exactly how he testifies. My understanding is he testifies a lot about addiction. That's how I know him best.

Q    Are you aware that Dr. Jack Henningfield has been identified by the plaintiff as a cigarette design expert in this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Who cares?  What's the relevance of that to Dr. Proctor's ability to testify on this subject? THE COURT:  Overruled.

Page 3361 there have been orders issued that permitted you to

testify about the history of cigarette design but

prohibited you from testifying and offering

independent scientific opinions about cigarette

design?

A    I just don't know one way or the other.  I realize that in every case there are all kinds of motions in limine and limitations, things like that. You can't just testify about anything you want to.

Q    That's fair.

If courts in the federal system and the state system, including in this courthouse, have issued orders that restricted your testimony in ways that allowed you to testify about the history of cigarette design but not to provide pure scientific opinions about cigarette design, you simply wouldn't know that, would you?

A    I wouldn't be surprised.  I hear that all the time.  The tobacco industry is always trying to say I'm not an expert in anything really.  That's one of the things they try to say is, they try to restrict me to a very narrow scope.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if that's happened.

Q    If courts have issued those types of orders?

THE COURT:  I think if you want to get that into evidence, I think we need to know question and answer what was the lie.  I want to know the question that was asked, the politician that was asked, or the answer.  I don't think he's going to be allowed to just generally get up here and say there were general lies given to certain people.  We don't have any factual foundation for that.

there even a debate that the Tobacco Institute lied

and manipulated elected officials?

A    No.  That's a well-known historical fact, as well as the fact that the North and the South fought in the Civil War.  It's an undisputed historical fact.

Q    I don't think � I think facts are facts �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, at this point I don't think further voir dire would be helpful. It's very clear that this witness cannot provide the type of predicate that the Court has identified in terms of saying what was said to whom, when, by whom, why, and what is the evidence that that is a lie.

Now, if specific documents give rise to that type of predicate, we can take those up one at a time, but I'd ask that they have to approach and do that outside the presence of the jury, given their inability to satisfy any prima facie basis for this testimony at this juncture. THE COURT:  All right.  Let me take a quick recess, and then we'll bring in the jury. MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. THE BAILIFF:  Court is in recess.

Okay.  As far as the lying to politicians general statement, without some more examples of those facts that can be specifically gotten from the record or from documents that are in evidence, there should be no mention of that in front of the jury or questions associated with it unless you're going to be putting in evidence certain documents that establish that or that establish exactly what that's all based on so that the jury can have something that's based on evidence.  So you should approach me at sidebar regarding any of those.

With regard to cigarette design, the witness -- although by cross-examination I think counsel for the defendants can challenge the witness' amount of requisite knowledge, skill, or experience, he has at least enough either knowledge, skill, or experience, and I think that Daubert uses the term "or," it could be any of them, to be able to testify about cigarette design as it relates to health and disease based

Page 3367 on his academic credentials, his teaching

experience in it, the fact that the FDA has

utilized him for that purpose, and the like.

With regard to cigarette design as it relates to cigarette health and disease, he can testify as to those types of issues subject to any objection that might come up with him going beyond the scope of the expertise that he does have, and that will be subject to obviously cross-examination by the defendants as to the types of questions they asked him in voir dire.

You'd never been involved in that, you've never been involved in agriculture, you've never been involved in all these things, but those really go to the weight of it as opposed to an issue that should go to the jury as opposed to that being decided by the Judge.  All right. (Thereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Have a seat.

Okay.  Ready to proceed?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir, thank you.

May it please the Court?  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

A    Good afternoon.

Q    Ready to pick up where we left off?

A    Yes.

Q    Excellent.

So we were talking about this subject of compensation and cigarette advertisement for filtered cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    We introduced PT 2199.  While they are reviewing that, Dr. Proctor, who is the most susceptible to the messages about the safety of filtered cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor. MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2199.

MR. FURR:  Respectfully, I can't review whether I have an objection to a document and defend against part of the questioning at the same time.  So I'd ask that we do one or the other, not ask that we do both at the same time.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2199.  We'll move that into evidence.

THE COURT:  If you guys don't have � you know, it appears to the Court that you're not handing any documents to the clerk.  Until you

in evidence until we actually get it marked and

establish that you guys have all said -- it's

subject to you guys looking at it later.

So why don't we figure that out later and just proceed, and you can move it into evidence for purposes of the record and you guys can ask me to defer, if that's what you want me to do. And we'll deal with those issues later.  The only time that that can't happen is when you have to ask the witness a question that deals with that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to introduce and show documents to the jury.  Right now I want to introduce 2199.

MR. BRENNER:  Can we approach for one moment briefly?

THE COURT:  All right. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  Can I just address this really quickly?

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, let me just � Judge, just so you understand what we do, and I thought we kind of explained it to your clerk, but in these trials because there's so many documents,

is we put together the list and we provide it to

track.  We give it to your clerk.  It's all

documents are introduced, we do this formally in

front of the Court.  The Court admits the

documents.

THE COURT:  You have to do it before the jury goes back?

MR. HAMMER:  Right.

THE COURT:  And you've given me all of the evidence, but everybody is saying that it's subject to them reviewing it at the end.

MR. HAMMER:  No, no, no, that's just the medical records.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, it's not just the medical records.  Let me explain this.

MR. FURR:  Here is our objection.  I can explain this.  When Mr. Gdanski offers a composite exhibit that has multiple documents underlying that exhibit for which he seeks admission, that is the occasion with which we have asked the Court to defer ruling with respect to the specific documents.

A

Yes.

Q    And does it discuss this idea of compensation as it relates to filtered cigarettes?

A    It does.

Q    It says, As we know all too often the smoker who switches to a high-fi. What does that mean?

A    That's a high filtration cigarette, also capturing the sort of resonance of the high fidelity stereo craze at the time but it means hi filtration in this concept.

Q    Winds up smoking more units in order to provide himself with the same delivery which he had before.

What process is that describing?

A    It's describing compensation.  The units are cigarettes.

Q    In short, I don't believe the smoking pattern has changed much even with cancer scares and filtered cigarettes.

Do you see that?

Q    Dr. Proctor, did the industry know, based on the documentary evidence before the jury, that when a smoker would switch to a filtered cigarette or a high filtration cigarette, they would essentially wind up smoking more units or getting just as much tar and nicotine?

MR. FURR:  I object to using the term industry in that question, Your Honor.  This is not an industry document.  It's a company specific document.

THE COURT:  All right.  Rephrase the question.

A    Yes.

Q    So is this notion, is this what we see

here � which company is this from?

A    This is from Philip Morris.

Q    Were they part of the conspiracy?

A    Yes.  They're the maker of Marlboro cigarettes.

Q    From this Philip Morris document, can we tell that it was known within the confines of the co-conspirators that a smoker who would switch to a high filtration cigarette would end up getting just as much of the tar and nicotine in a non-filtered cigarette?

A    Yes.  They would smoke more in the sense that it's a type of compensation, one of the things that defeated the value of filters or later low tars. MR. BRENNER:  Can we approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yeah. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  It's nonstop.  It's the exact same thing.  We even said, are you sure the witness is not going to blurt out and go beyond filters?  And Mr. Gdanski assured us he will not do that.  And, boom, later low tar cigarettes,

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, it's the same concept. You can't � he can't � I don't think Dr. Proctor, quite frankly, can discuss the history --

THE COURT:  I thought you were going to preface it and say that -- when you left the sidebar last time, you said you were going to say, don't talk about low tar.

MR. GDANSKI:  Did I do that?  I don't remember even if I did.

MR. BRENNER:  It was before lunch, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, filtered cigarettes are low tar cigarettes, though.  I don't understand, it's like a distinction or the difference -- filtered cigarettes are low tar and light cigarettes.  We are not talking about lights.  Filtered cigarettes are low tar cigarettes.  Lights is a separate category of cigarettes.  I can have him explain that --

THE COURT:  So he said low tar �

MR. BRENNER:  He said filtered and then later low tar cigarettes, which is between those -- what he's talking about, Your Honor,

Page 3377 there's two different stories --

THE COURT:  Here is what he said.  All right.  So the question was then:  From this Philip Morris document, can we tell that it was known within the confines of the co-conspirators that a smoker who would switch to a high filtration cigarette would end up getting just as much of the tar and nicotine in a non-filtered cigarette?

MR. BRENNER: So the question is fine as it says to filtered cigarette. No problem with the question.

THE COURT:  Yes, they would smoke more in this instance.  It's the type of compensation, one of the things that defeated the value of filters or low tar � or later low tars.

MR. BRENNER:  Right.  So he's saying filters, he answers the question above, but then he adds, later low tars, which is a --

THE COURT:  So why don't I just give an instruction that says we'll take out the later low tars reference and I'11 bring the witness here and we'll explain it to him.

MR. BRENNER:  Here is the problem I'm having, Your Honor.

Page 3378 THE COURT:  What is the big objection with

low tars?

MR. BRENNER:  He never smoked them.

MR. GUEST:  It was part of our Motion in Limine, Your Honor, on compensation.  It has absolutely no applicability to the issues in the case; therefore, regardless of Mr. Gdanski's anticipated argument on reprehensibility, he cannot introduce any of this evidence because there is no conduct related to low tar or light cigarettes that injured Mr. Shulman.

MR. BRENNER:  Let me go one step further.

MR. GDANSKI:  Go ahead.  I'll wait until you're done, but I do have an argument I want to make.

MR. BRENNER:  I just want to go one step further.  I don't want to get into the argument right now because, Your Honor -- Mr. Gdanski disagrees with that ruling, that's fine, we can have an argument, but that doesn't give him the right or the witness the right to disregard it.

Your ruling was, come do this outside the presence of the jury.  How many times can we give -- do we have to come up here and ask for you to strike the witness' testimony with just

because, look, now you have the defendants

wanting to hide things all the time.  I don't

know how this witness could not have been told

in no uncertain terms do not do this.

MR. GDANSKI:  Why don't we instead do this, make a ruling that the witness can talk about low tar cigarettes.  Because, Judge, he can, it is part of the conspiracy and the fraud.  I will lay that foundation.  Realistically, Judge, this is part of the fraud and conspiracy, lights and low tars, the manipulation of it, the lies about it go to the fraud and conspiracy counts.

Under the cases we discussed yesterday, they fall squarely � that discussion falls absolutely squarely within all of the appropriate evidence.  This is a shifting justification and a red herring because this is admissible.  This is admissible.  Your Honor can make the call now that this is admissible testimony in this case, and we don't have to have this fuss.

MR. BRENNER:  If life were only that easy, Your Honor.  Look, we can have a hearing on this outside of sidebar.  So they have a different

part of the conspiracy, whether it has anything

to do with Mr. Shulman, is automatically

admissible.  I think that is dead wrong.

I know that you ruled on this.  Your Honor, you had a pretrial ruling on this.  Remember when you went back and you read State Farm and Reuters.  The issue we were talking about then was foreign warnings.  And what the plaintiff argued was, hey, it's part of the story.  It's something they did back -- and you kept it out �

THE COURT:  I recall.  Right now what I'm going to do is, I'm going to bring the witness in and tell him not to refer to it anymore.  I'm going to strike the reference to, later as low tar � he didn't say much about it.  All he says is, later low tar cigarettes.

MR. BRENNER:  So you'll instruct the witness now?

THE COURT:  Yes.

Witness, can you come over in the middle?

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  Right now there is a Motion in Limine on, later low tar cigarettes.

Page 3385 Honor, the document yesterday we were not

asserting the Bliley objection.  This is a

Bliley document.  We were ordered to produce the

document and make it available.  The defendants

have never throughout the course of this

litigation and previous litigation voluntarily

waived the privilege.  We continue to assert the

objection that it is privileged and we have done

so continuously �

THE COURT:  Why is it on the web site?  It is because you were ordered �

MS. LEHMAN:  Because we were ordered to put it on the web site, yes, Your Honor.  That is not sufficient to waive the privilege.  Under clear Florida law only involuntary, knowing waiver waives the privilege, and we have not done that.

MR. GDANSKI:  There has been specific cases, published cases finding that these Bliley documents are not privileged.  They're subject to the crime-fraud exception.  Anybody can go get them online right now.

In our first trial, just anecdotally, in this courthouse when Reynolds objected that some of these documents were privileged, and then

Page 3386 afterwards Judge Sasser came back and saw they

were publicly available online, she -- you know,

it can't be both ways.

I won't say how she felt about it but it can't be both ways that the document is online for public viewing and asserted to be privileged.  So anybody can go see it in the entire world but they're still claiming it's privileged.  It's disingenuous.  It's not true. It's not legally valid.

There's cases from the Minnesota Supreme Court dealing specifically with all of these Bliley documents.  I've used them time and time again in every trial in this county and in Broward County.  They're 100 percent of the time routinely introduced in front of Judge Murphy down in Broward County.  We gave Your Honor a memo on the Bliley objection and that issue, and I should be able to proceed.  It's not privileged.  It's not a privileged document.

MS. LEHMAN:  This is incorrect.  I'm glad that counsel has brought up Judge Sasser because the last time this issue came up before Judge Sasser was in December of last year in the Halliburton case, and Judge Sasser excluded them

that in the middle of a trial.  And she excluded

them.  I'm happy to provide the transcript if

you'd like.

MR. GDANSKI:  I just did that with this witness for this document.  It's publicly available online.  Anyone can get it, Judge. How is that privileged?

THE COURT:  They're claiming that it's privileged �

MR. GDANSKI:  It came in in Engle.

THE COURT:  They're claiming that it's privileged because they're saying that the only reason it's online is that they were ordered by a Judge to put them online.  And that the case law in this area requires a voluntary waiver, so they're saying, I did not voluntarily waive it. Some employee left and put that stuff out there, and then a Judge ordered us to put it on the web site, so I'm still maintaining the privilege.

But the question then for me is, how does that privilege -- even if they're correct on that, how does the privilege apply?  It doesn't apply to the general public, it only applies to

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, it's a little bit different than that because imagine these documents are stolen from counsel's office and put on the web site.  That doesn't somehow waive the privilege.  That is equivalent to what has happened here.  The fact that they are publicly available does not waive the privilege.  The fact that they are privileged prevents them from being --

MR. GDANSKI:  But that's �

THE COURT:  If it's exposed to third parties, it is, but you're saying it was an involuntary disclosure?

MR. GDANSKI:  It begs the question of why is it on the web site.  The reason it's still on the web site is because it's not privileged. Why haven't they done anything to take it down off that web site?  It was admitted in the initial �

MS. LEHMAN:  She did but the reason that that is and that's what counsel is arguing �

THE COURT:  It was a case management tool that she used.

MS. LEHMAN:  Well, kind of, but if I may explain, Your Honor.  The reason she excluded those is because if Your Honor is going to find that they are subject to the crime-fraud exception, which is what plaintiff is asking you to do, then you must have a document by document hearing where plaintiff puts on prima facia evidence that these are part of the crime-fraud exception.  Failure do that, Your Honor, is reversible error.  That is why Judge Sasser used that tool, because she did not have an option if she wanted to protect her trial.

MR. HAMMER:  If ever you're concerned about reversible error, the fact that the Engle Court allowed these documents in over objection from all four of these defendants at the time --

THE COURT:  Why don't we do this.

MR. HAMMER:  And the fact that the Florida Supreme Court did not say that was error, because that was addressed.  They challenged

Supreme Court upheld that decision that allowed

individual smokers to present their cases.

That's one of these cases, Judge.  They

introduced them in the Engle case.  The Court

should not have any fear, as defense counsel is

telling you to put into your mind that it's

reversible error, that it is reversible error

allow these documents in.  That is not the case.

That's not true.

MR. GDANSKI:  We've used this document these other, quote/unquote, Bliley documents in so many other cases, and they've never even appealed it.

THE COURT:  What kind of hearing do we need to have on this whole thing?

MR. GDANSKI:  I just laid it all out �

MS. LEHMAN:  Plaintiff needs to put on prima facie evidence that, one, the advice of counsel was sought to cure fraud, and, two, that the attorney/client relationship was used to perpetrate a fraud.  They must do so without relation to the documents.  The documents cannot be used in evidence --

THE COURT:  An evidentiary hearing?

MR. GDANSKI:  It was done.  Yes, yes, it was done.

THE COURT:  Was it a settlement agreement?

MS. LEHMAN:  No, Your Honor, that's incorrect.  These documents were initially produced in the E.G. case.  During the appeal the United States House Commerce Committee subpoenaed the documents, and it was the House who put them on their web site initially.  That was the initial public disclosure.

MR. GDANSKI:  And after that they were publicly released.

THE COURT:  But why are they on their web

MR. GDANSKI:  It's on their web site as part of the master settlement agreement.  This is not factually accurate what they are telling you.  There was compelled production and then thereafter there was a settlement agreement where they agreed to release their internal documents.

Q    Are you familiar with the Engle findings, Dr. Proctor?

A    Yes, I am.

Q    You're aware there was a finding that the tobacco companies concealed material information from the public not otherwise known regarding the health effects of smoking and the addictive nature of smoking.

A    That's true.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did these companies conceal information from the public not otherwise known?

A    Yes.  That was the whole point of the conspiracy launched in 1953 was to make sure that the truth that people needed to know did not get out?

Q    Were they effective in blocking people who needed to know the truth from hearing the truth?

A    Very effective.

Q   Were lives lost because of that?

A    Yes.

Q   People got sick because of that.

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not true. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   Go ahead.

A    Yes, that's true.  As a result of the conspiracy, the deception, the concealment, millions of lives were unnecessarily lost.

Q    Are you familiar with the role that at the time the conspiracy took place the individuals who were attorneys played?

A    Yes.

Q    What was that role?

A    The Committee of Counsel of lawyers was the supreme authority of the entire conspiracy.  They ran all of the key issues in each of those three pillars that I mentioned, regulation, litigation, legislation, public opinion, those were the key realms that the Committee of Counsel orchestrated for the entire conspiracy.

Page 3403 THE COURT:  Wherever you're comfortable,

just don't block the view of the jury. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, Professor Proctor, what year did the tobacco companies embark upon a conspiracy?

A    1953.

Q    Okay.  What was it in 1953 that happened which set in motion for the companies to conspire and commit fraud?

A    Three years prior to this time, 1950, '51, '52, there had been an outpouring of new scientific research showing that cigarettes could cause cancer, in particular lung cancer.  It was very powerful evidence.  It was widely reported.  Billions of fewer cigarettes were smoked.  So the conspiracy was about restoring confidence in the sense of safety of cigarettes.

Q    Just � we're going to go through some of the documents, but after there was this new evidence, epidemiologic evidence, did the companies first meet, get together, and plan a course of action?

A    They did.  They met at the Plaza Hotel on December 14 and 15th, 1953, right after the publication of the mouse painting experiments which showed that there was a cancer-causing substance in

Q    They met at the Plaza Hotel.  Do we have

the documents to demonstrate that taking place?

A    Some of them, yes.

Q    We'11 move them into evidence in a little bit.  When did they meet at the Plaza Hotel?

A    December 14, 1953.

Q    Who met at the Plaza Hotel?

A It was the CEOs of all of the companies involved in the conspiracy, with the exception of Liggett, which pursued a different course.

Q    What happened when these companies met at the Plaza Hotel?

A    They decided to hire Hill & Knowlton, the world's largest public relations firm, to conduct a public relations campaign to restore the reputation of the cigarette by essentially denying the scientific evidence or disputing it.

Q    So what was the date they met?

A    The 14th of December, 1953.

Q After they met at the Plaza Hotel, they decided to hire Hill & Knowlton.

A    Yes, during the meeting actually.

Q    Then what took place over the course of the next couple of days?

Page 3405 A    Well, the next day, December 15th, Hill &

Knowlton met with the four leading research directors

of the largest manufacturers.  This was to interview

them to find out whether they knew about addiction

and cancer.

Q    Do we have those documents to show the jury as well?

A    We do.  That's called a Forwarding Memorandum.

Q    That was giving an overview of what took place.  They meet, they create this document the Forwarding Memorandum.  What happens next?

A    What happens next is they continue to meet, they develop a plan which involves distracting from and denying the scientific evidence.  They essentially launch a war on the truth.

Q    And for how many years did the tobacco companies wage war on the truth?

A    For many decades.

Q    So you've referenced the conspiracy.  We're going to look at these documents together.  Are you familiar with how the conspiracy, after it took shape, branched itself out?

A    Yes.

Q   Please.

A    Well, at the heart of the conspiracy were the six companies, the top manufacturers.  Liggett joins later.  They were not originally involved. Various instruments or arms or organs were established to carry out the conspiracy.  Hill & Knowlton was brought in for the public relations arm of the conspiracy.  I'll call that PR.

In 1954, a couple weeks later from the Plaza Hotel meeting, they set up the TIRC, which was the first important instrument of the conspiracy, that was the distraction research arm.  They produced, they funded research, hundreds of millions of dollars of research, good basic biology that had nothing to do with cigarettes.  That's why I call it distraction research.  I'll call that DR.

In other words, it was good research that led to Noble prizes.  It was good basic biology, biochemistry, neurology, but always blaming something besides cigarettes for disease.  In other words, it was not smoking that caused cancer.  It was viruses, occupational exposures at your workplace, air pollution, your genetic constitution, whether you've

TIRC.

The TIRC itself sprouts off another arm of

the conspiracy called the TI.  This was the chief

Washington office of the conspiracy, in a way the

most important administrative organ for the entire

conspiracy.  It conducted all governmental relations.

It issued a great deal of propaganda brochures, a

great deal of research on a very large scale.  They

published a newsletter called Tobacco and Health

Report which summarized cigarette friendly research

and emphasized the controversy --

MR. BRENNER:  As he's going through, I see

columns that Mr. Gdanski described it earlier as

the tentacles of the fraud, which the doctor is

drawing as tentacles, which I don't think the

Court can see.

Right into it, right into government

relations.  You just keep talking about it and

it just keeps happening.  They don't want their

witness admonished.  They tell you before trial,

THE COURT:  Where did he say � where does he say government --

MR. BRENNER:  He just said it.  He just said it.  At this time, Your Honor, I have no choice but to move for a mistrial since there's repeated disregard for Your Honor's rulings.

MR. GDANSKI:  This witness said nothing wrong, not even close.  I mean, there comes a point in time when I would ask the Court to see the objections for what they are, which is an effort to stifle the truth.  Dr. Proctor can't not talk about the conspiracy.

THE COURT:  Hang on while I look at where it says that in the record.  It's hard for me to listen to you while I'm looking at this.

MR. GDANSKI:  That makes sense.

THE COURT:  It doesn't say that.

MR. BRENNER:  Unfortunately it's missed in the rough part, Your Honor.  I don't think Mr. Gdanski will dispute.  In that answer he said, you see those asterisks where the court reporter takes down that it means she doesn't know for sure, she's going to fill it in from

governmental relations.  I don't think anyone

will deny it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is what it says.  It says that, This was the chief Washington office of the conspiracy, in a way the most important administrative organ for the entire conspiracy. It conducted all governmental relations.  It issued a great deal of propaganda brochures. There was no objection, by the way, a great deal of research on a very large scale.  They did conduct all government relations.

He actually refrained from saying what he probably shouldn't be able to say and wanted to say, which is, they conducted all governmental relations and impacted Congress and legislature. He confined himself to Your Honor's ruling. They don't want this man to keep testifying.

THE COURT:  I don't know that the reference to government relations really affects the case law on this subject matter.  How does it affect the case law of the subject matter?  And if so, somebody ought to give me a copy of that case that you-all cite to on the First Amendment issue.

MR. BRENNER:  Sure

MR. GUEST:  Sure.

THE COURT:  I don't know that this general reference to government relations �

MR. BRENNER:  It's part of the fraud.  Part of the fraud is the government relations.  The whole answer is drawing -- as Your Honor can't see, because it's facing the jury, he's drawing the tentacle of the fraud.  This is one tentacle of the fraud, the government relations.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  That is not what he wrote.  That's not at all true.  The tentacle of the fraud is the Tobacco Institute.  Then he said that the Tobacco Institute was in charge of governmental relations.  But he did not, pursuant to Your Honor's order, ever say, and by the way, as part of the government relations, they effectuated change or prevented change in Congress or legislature, which is what Your Honor told them not to do.

So to say that he has now written on the board a tentacle of the conspiracy is governmental relations, that was unfair.

MR. BRENNER:  I did not say that.

MR. GDANSKI:  That was the implication.

Page 3411 THE COURT:  Here he didn't say � even with

the missed part of the transcript � you didn't

show me the other one � all he said was that

they were in charge of propaganda, brochures,

distraction research, newsletters, and health

reports that summarized cigarette friendly

research and emphasized the controversy in

government relations.  It was not tied to

anything specific.

MR. BRENNER:  All I can say is he's describing -- Mr. Gdanski agrees with me.  He is describing TI, the Tobacco Institute, as part of the fraud.  And TI was in charge of those things, including government relations.

MR. GDANSKI:  They're also in charge of making sure there was pens and paper in the office.

THE COURT:  I'm sure everybody in the world, including the jury, knows that all the corporations have to deal with government relations.  I'm not sure that that means much to the jury at this point without tying it to anything else, without saying anything further. So I think you -- your motion for mistrial is not well founded.

Q    Dr. Proctor, quick question, as part of the

years that the conspiracy took place, did the

industry effectively use litigation as a means to

prevent the truth from coming out?

A

Yes

Q    Did they do that � did they successfully use litigation as a tool to prevent people from hearing the truth?

A    Yes.  Well, they went that way and the other way around was keeping the truth away from the people, so that would influence litigation.

Q    So continue on with how this conspiracy played out.

A    Well, there was several other arms of the conspiracy, many of which were formally committees of the Tobacco Institute.  And, for example, there was something called the Committee of Counsel.  I'll write that COC.  I've already mentioned that.  That was the supreme authority of the conspiracy.  It's really the only place you find dissent and disagreement within the conspiracy because they were making the rules.

That consisted of the top lawyer from each of the major companies.  They would meet regularly, usually once a month.  They were very powerful and had a lot of influence.

Q   Was there one person who was the head of that committee?

A    Yes, there was a chairman, a rotating

Q    Did that person have a name within the

documents?

A    There are occasional references to �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  We have to approach before this testimony goes any further.

THE COURT:  All right. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I'm not a mind reader, but I know what he was getting ready to say.  He was getting ready to say that we had a meeting with counsel that was referred to as the God King.  I don't think Mr. Gdanski will dispute that was what he was going to say.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's the truth.

MR. FURR:  The God King name comes from a single Philip Morris document.  We have the document here.  I'll hand it to Your Honor.

It's a single Philip Morris document which was from Committee of Counsel from 1994.  It was founded in the files of a Philip Morris secretary.  It is the only document in existence that uses this name God King.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  What it's saying �

MR. FURR:  I haven't finished the explanation.

Some kind of self-aggrandizement, self-flagellation, whatever you want to call it. There is zero evidence that that document ever went anywhere and anyone else ever saw it, other than the author and the secretary.

THE COURT:  Is the document in evidence?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to move it into evidence.  It's on my list of documents to move into evidence.

MR. FURR:  We're going to object to it. It's completely irrelevant to any issue in this case.  It's unfairly prejudicial.  There's no evidence whatsoever that anybody ever saw that document.

THE COURT:  The question is, what relevance does it have that outweighs the prejudice to a reference that somebody is a God King in front of the jury?

MR. GDANSKI:  This is how they self-applauded and referred to the individual who had the supreme authority over the conspiracy.  We think this is very relevant.  It is very relevant to this case.  What Your Honor is reading into the document is not, I think, the correct ruling.

THE COURT:  Do you have any other documents that refer to him as God King, or any other testimony?

MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor knows about it, and Dr. Proctor knows who the next God King was. It's not a salutation, it's not a celebration of the one who retired, it's the coronation of the future king.  It's electing Steve Parish as the next God King.

THE COURT:  Doctor, were you going to make reference to Mr. Stephens as the God King?

THE WITNESS:  I can.  That's what was I was intending to do.

Page 3420 THE COURT:  That's why they objected.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, I know.

THE COURT:  What is your basis for referring to Mr. Stephens -- what's a proffer, I'm looking for a proffer on -- what's your basis for referring to this document?  It's this one agenda.

THE WITNESS:  It's the context of that. That is the principal source for me.

THE COURT:  Do you have any other sources besides this one?

THE WITNESS:  No.  That's the one time we know of where that expression appears.

THE COURT:  I'm going to find that I'm weighing what's been proffered before me, and I'm finding that it would be overly prejudicial compared to any relevance that it would have. It seems to have very minimal relevance compared to its potential for being overly prejudicial. It uses a religious reference, a self-grandiose reference.  We don't know the context of it.  So I'm going to instruct you and instruct the parties not to make any reference in front of the jury to the term "God King."

MR. GDANSKI:  We do know the context.

understand this is the only reference to it. MR. GDANSKI:  The context is that

Mr. Stevens was retiring and was being referred

to as a God King.

THE WITNESS:  Right.

THE COURT:  When people retire, they become

legends and they are referred to as oftentimes

greater than they really were.  That may be what

happened here. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, picking up where we left off, the Committee of Counsel, remind us who they were and what role they played.

A The supreme body of the conspiracy constituted by the top lawyer at each of the participating companies.

Q    Okay.  And those were lawyers who worked for the companies?

A    Yes, they were what we call in-house lawyers.

Q    And keep going.

A   There was another body that was called ad hoc committee, and these were the external lawyers,

hired outside the companies, and they conducted

special research that was cigarette friendly.  They

would hire experts to say that the science was not

substantial or the Surgeon General was wrong, things

like that.

Q    Dr. Proctor, did lawyers and law firms hired by the tobacco companies play a role in concealing information from the people who needed to hear it?

A They were crucial to it, yeah. The lawyers ran the conspiracy at the highest levels because in a way all of these were sort of legal problems.

Q    Does that include lawyers from private law firms?

A    Yes.  That's the ad hoc committee.  These were private law firms hired by the tobacco companies.

Q    Were these lawyers very effective at keeping information from the public?

A    Yes.

Q    Did that have impact?

A    Of course, it did.

Q    Would it have been a public health benefit if the people were not prevented by the lawyers from

Q    Would it have here?

A    It certainly would have in this case, yes. Q    Keep going.

A    Well, in addition to these committees, the Tobacco Institute was the formal authority for a number of committees.  Actually, the Committee of Counsel was often referred to as a subcommittee of the Tobacco Institute, but the Tobacco Institute had other subcommittees which were important arms of the conspiracy.

For example, they had what was called the executive committee.  The executive committee, which was formally part of the Tobacco Institute, consisted of the president of each of the six companies involved.  So that executive committee met together and had a chairman and so forth as all of those committees did.

There was also something called the Technical Committee.  This was the top scientist at each of the companies.  And they organized the technical research aspects of the conspiracy.  They had liaison with the National Cancer Institute and other bodies of the national institute of health

Page 3424 involved in the whole safer cigarette question and

what was called the tobacco working group.

There were other bodies, there was the AMA's ERF, which I've obliquely already mentioned. That was simply another distraction research organ funded by the $20 million that I mentioned that was given to the AMA.  That was another distraction research body.

There were the Tobacco Action Networks, which were involved in local community relations.  So whereas the Tobacco Institute was more concerned with national affairs, the Tobacco Action Networks were more concerned with local committee affairs on sort of a state-by-state type of basis.

There was also something called ARISE, the Associates for Research into the Science of Enjoyment.  This was established later in the conspiracy, not until the late 1980s.  That was an effort to hire about 100 professors from all over the world to say that, while there may be some harms from smoking physically, the more important fact is that mentally you can actually be helped by cigarettes because they relieve stress.  Since stress was thought sometimes to cause disease, the argument was that smoking cigarettes could actually cure disease

Another body -- let's see.  I should say that the TIRC was renamed the Counsel for Tobacco Research in 1964, but it had the same function.  It was renamed.  The "industry" word was taken out of the title.

There was another group called the Center for Indoor Air Research.  That's another body that was established late in the conspiracy, in the 1980s. Whereas everything else I've talked about was principally concerned with smoking, the Center for Indoor Air Research was concerned with denial of harms from secondhand smoke.  So it doesn't really become an issue until the 1980s with the threat of clean air laws, efforts to ban smoking in restaurants, airplanes, things like that.  This was a body designed to say that secondhand smoke was an entirely different type of smoke that did not cause harm.  There were other committees, but this is the chief architecture of the conspiracy. Q    Yes, sir.

One of the things I heard you talk about was the role that scientists played through the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, later named CTR, to try to point to enviromental factors or

Page 3426 occupational factors as the cause of diseases that

the Public Health Community were saying were caused

by smoking.

A    Yes.

Q    For how long as part of the conspiracy did they point to occupational or environmental factors as the cause of the disease and not smoking?

A    Throughout the conspiracy, it was called alternative causation.  They become leading funders of path-breaking nontobacco causes of cancer, like prions, for example.

Prions, Stanley Prusiner wins the Nobel prize for finding prions.  That was funded almost entirely by R.J. Reynolds as part of their small virus project, designed to distract attention away from cigarettes and onto viruses.  So alternative causation was a theme throughout the conspiracy.

Q    As part of the alternative causation theme, trying to say diseases aren't caused by smoking but they're caused by other causes, were the tobacco companies effective in doing that?

A    Very effective.  They actually pushed research into new directions of research of nontobacco causation.  They were effective in getting, for example, the war on cancer to be focused

viruses in actually causing cancer.

Q   Were the claims that people don't get

diseases from smoking cigarettes because they had

other exposures, environmental or occupational, is

that part of the conspiracy and fraud?

A    It was key to the conspiracy and fraud.

That's why I call it a type of distraction or

misdirection.  It was saying let's look at these

nontobacco causes and just sort of ignore the

cigarette causes.

Q    Dr. Proctor, do you know who William Dunn

is and Myron Johnston?

A    Yes.

Q    So we've talked for quite a while about

filters before.  Did the companies ever publicly say,

hey, we know we're telling people about these

filtered cigarettes, but really it's nothing more

than an illusion?

A    They didn't say that publicly.  They said

that privately.

Q    Do we have an example of that?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 3 678.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  We move this into evidence,

Q    Let's take a look at the first page.  Can you see it, Dr. Proctor?

A    I can.

Q    Tell us, who is Myron Johnston?

A    Myron Johnston was econometrician, researcher and marketing in the research department at Philip Morris in the '60s and '70s.

Q   Who is William Dunn?

A    William Dunn was the head of psychopharmacology at Philip Morris.  Part of the psychology program that was established in the 1960s at Philip Morris to explore why people begin to smoke and why they continued to smoke.

Q    Did Mr. Dunn or Dr. Dunn have a nickname at Philip Morris?

A    Mr. Dunn was called the nicotine kid.

Q    So what we are looking at here is June 1966, Special Report:  Market Potential of a Health Cigarette Confidential. Do you see that?

Q    It says distribution to Wakeham and 10

people in his department.

A    Yes.

Q    And Dr. RB Seligman.  Who is that?

A    Bob Seligman was the chief research officer superior to Helmut Wakeman.

Q    Who is Helmut Wakeman?

A    Helmut Wakeman is the vice president for research and development at Philip Morris from 1959 to around 1980.

Q    So this is two years after the Surgeon General's report comes out in 1964?

A    It is.

Q   Filtered cigarettes are what percentage of the market?

A    By this time they would be about 60 to 70 percent.

Q    They're advertising for filters just like the ones we saw, Flintstones, Winston, Marlboro, right ?

A    It's continuing, yes.

Q    Let's go to the next page.  Internally, in this confidential document, what does Philip Morris say about the true impact of filtration?

this document to the illusion of filtration.  Here

they comment that the illusion of filtration is as

important as the fact of filtration.

Q    Has there ever been a public statement from Philip Morris where it says, hey, our filters are merely an illusion?

A    No.

Q    Are they, though, in reality nothing more than an illusion?

A    They are.  They're kind of a deception and an illusion.

Q    Do the companies still today sell filtered cigarettes?

A    They do.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do they sell filters today?

A    They do.  Almost all cigarettes are filtered.

Q    Now, one of the things that I want to ask you about is:  Did the Public Health Community encourage tobacco companies to develop filtered

Page 3432 cigarettes?

A    They went along with it, is a better way to say that.

Q    Okay.

A    It is true that they very often recommended that people switched to filtered because they really had bought into this same mythology, this same illusion.

Q    Do we know from the historical record the context in which the Public Health Community was going along with recommendations for filtered cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    Did the Public Health Community report that filtered cigarettes were safer?

A    They often did, yes.  There's not only one Public Health Community.  It's true that leading elements of the Public Health Community, Surgeon General's office, many other things, went along, unfortunately, with this idea that filters were safe.

Q    Sometimes did these elements and aspects of the Public Health Community encourage people if you're going to smoke, switch to a filtered cigarette?

A    That was extremely common.  You found that

Q    Do we know the historical context in which

all that took place?

A    Yes.

Q    What was it?

A    It's in the context of deception and conspiracy.

Page 3434 about the Public Health Community and filtered

cigarettes, about what took place and why it took

place?

A    We know that it comes undone.  The illusion of filtration is revealed as an illusion with the release of the industry's secret documents in the 1990s.  Then you have a kind of consensus that emerges around the year 2000 that filters are no safer.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This is a hearsay document, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's a scientific consensus. THE COURT:  Hang on.  No comments. Okay.  I will sustain the objection and strike the reference to the scientific consensus.  The jury should disregard it.  You may ask follow-up questions. MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the Public Health Community know that it was an illusion, that filtration was an illusion? A    Not at the time that cigarettes were being first marketed.  There's -- the Public Health community really didn't know very well how cigarettes were actually designed.  So they sort of fell into a

Page 3435 lot of traps, and they essentially went along with

the mythology of the illusion.  They were fooled.

Q    So after the Public Health Community had the benefit, after the Surgeon General and the National Cancer Institute had the benefit of these documents that say filtration is an illusion and the other documents discussing the other subjects on filtration, what happened?

A    They changed their minds.  So up until the '90s, it was quite common to hear leading Government officials, public health authorities saying it's best not to smoke at all, but if you do smoke, it's best to smoke a filter.  And that comes under done in the around the year 2000.

Q    Without specifically discussing light or low tar cigarettes, was there � did the Federal Trade Commission have testing and methods to examine the nicotine and tar yields in cigarettes?

A    They did.

Q    Ultimately, did the Federal Trade Commission rescind their earlier guidance as it relates to tar and nicotine yields in cigarettes?

A    They did.  In the year 2008, the Federal Trade Commission reversed its position and refused to say that there was any benefit to these other

MR. GDANSKI:  We'd move into evidence PT 5480. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    You're familiar with a press release from the Federal Trade Commission?

MR. BRENNER:  Read the number again.

MR. GDANSKI:  54 80.

MR. FURR:  Objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you need to approach to discuss your objection?

I take it since I didn't hear any other words --

MR. FURR:  Hearsay. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  This is a press release and the objection is hearsay.  A press release normally is hearsay, so how is it going to come in as an exception to hearsay?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  It's being offered to prove the context of the story and the historical record as it relates to the fraud and the conspiracy of the tobacco companies.  The FTC initially gave guidance and

Page 3437 said we think these are good measurements and

yields.  The FTC was misled by the tobacco

industry.  And ultimately the FTC came out and

said they're not going to make those

recommendations.

I'm not offering it to prove the truth of the matter asserted in that document. It goes to the nature and the scope and the winding up of the fraud and the conspiracy.

Also, Judge, this is a publicly available document.  We have a case here �

THE COURT:  There's a lot of documents that are publicly available.  That doesn't make them admissible in court.  That doesn't make them be an exception to the hearsay rule.

MR. GDANSKI:  It does when it comes to an expert being able to rely on hearsay in order to give his opinions.  This expert has to be able to review, rely upon, and be able to introduce and show to the jury documents that go to the make up of his opinions.  He would never have been able to fully develop historical opinions as it relates to the FTC's rescission of its guidance if the FTC didn't rescind its guidance.

THE COURT:  Are you asking him specifically

THE COURT:  You're not going to be able to do that.  I'm sustaining the objection.  There's no exception to the hearsay rule that allows it in as far as I could tell at this point.  I'm sustaining the objection.

MR. BRENNER:  We need to move this.  I can't do a sidebar.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, did the government and other

public health organizations recommend filters because

they were lied to by the tobacco companies?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. FURR:  Calls for speculation.  It's not

a proper subject for expert testimony.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have you reviewed government reports on the

subject of why they made the recommendations that

they made regarding filtered cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    Do you know, do we know, does anyone who

has ever had an occasion, opportunity or interest in

reviewing government reports, are they able to know

why the government made the recommendations they made

regarding filtered cigarettes?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Calls for

hearsay.  Ask him as to yes or no.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm laying a predicate.

Q    Can one tell from looking at the government's and the Public Health Community's position on filtered cigarettes and the evolution of that, understand why the government recommended what it recommended regarding filtered cigarettes?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Does the historical record reveal that the scientific community was fooled by the tobacco companies regarding filters?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection.  Leading and argumentative.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  What does it mean when you refer to a historical record?  So anything � if you refer to a historical record, then hearsay doesn't apply anymore?  If it's in a historical record, it's allowed in?  How does that work?

MR. GDANSKI:  He's reviewed the record. He's reviewed the testimony.  It's like if you ask an expert do the depositions indicate X, Y, and Z.  He is not asking him to parrot what they say.

THE COURT:  What is a historical record? What's that mean?

MR. GDANSKI: The history. What took place in the story, the documents, the statements, the videos.

THE COURT:  Then he'd be a conduit for all kinds of evidence.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, he's not.  An expert needs to rely upon hearsay in order to give his opinions.  I don't understand how else -- how can this man speak?  Judge, he's not being able to talk.  This is not his first trial.

THE COURT:  He's done a lot of talking.

Q    It is from the entity the National Cancer Institute.  Is that one of the same entities that back in the '70s and '80s had recommended filtered cigarettes.

A    Yes, that's true.

THE WITNESS:  It does.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    How does this book help you?

THE COURT:  I'm going to go back to asking the lawyers again to -- we can avoid the witness answering a question when there's an objection if you stand up when you object.

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  I told the witness yesterday when you see the lawyers stand up, that means you do not answer until I've ruled on the objection.  So that's the reason I want you to stand up, so that the witness will not answer, so that we don't have to have the witness give an answer in advance of my being able to rule on the objection.  I told both sides this repeatedly since, at least, yesterday, maybe earlier than that.  So I'm going to ask that both parties � because both parties I notice have not been doing this.  I think it avoids issues that way.  All right.  Thank you. MR. GDANSKI:

That's from 2001

Q    Okay.  When did the National Cancer Institute officially change its position and say we are no longer going to recommend filters because filters are more dangerous?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.  Reading from a document not in evidence.

THE COURT:  Approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Are you saying that the witness cannot tell us when the National Cancer Institute changed its position?  How is that any different than any of the other testimony this witness has given?

MR. BRENNER:  No, he's holding up a book, and he says when did this book come out?  2009. When did they -- and then he's giving the substance of what the book says which is --

THE COURT:  No, the question was:  When did the National Cancer Institute officially change its position and say, we are no longer going to recommend filters?

MR. BRENNER:  Whatever they say, the National Cancer Institute says, is hearsay.

Page 3450 MR. GDANSKI:  When?

MR. BRENNER:  Textbook hearsay.  You can't say, when did you say something.  And they say the when doesn't matter.  It's the substance of what they said.

THE COURT:  So the witness can't tell us when the National Cancer Institute took the position?  How does he report on history if he can't explain to us when the National Cancer Institute changed its position?

MR. BRENNER:  My concern is he's holding up a book, which he said he was going to try to move into evidence, and we can have the argument about if he tries it in evidence.  Instead of doing that, he's holding up a book --

THE COURT:  Why don't you ask the question again without holding up the book.

MR. BRENNER:  He's already saying what the National Cancer Institute said.

MR. GDANSKI:  What's the legal objection? I'm holding up a book?  The hold up a book objection?

MR. BRENNER:  Hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  The Judge overruled that. Now it's the hold up a book objection.

Page 3451 THE COURT:  Just ask him without reference

to the document, without holding up the book,

when did the National Cancer Institute change

its positions on filters.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  I'm going to ask him that.

MR. BRENNER:  We'll maintain the hearsay. And then while he is doing that, he is basically having the National Cancer Institute bolster his opinion.  He can ask what his position is.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, why can't I ask the question Your Honor just let me ask.

THE COURT:  Don't you think he's allowed to ask � if this guy is testifying about history, can't he give the history of when the National Cancer Institute changed its position?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I understand your ruling completely.  I think it's -- I find it difficult to draw the line that we're trying to draw, but I understand your ruling.

THE COURT:  Well, it's not a typical witness.  That's why I called you guys up to sidebar.  I don't know what other arguments you may have on it as to why I shouldn't allow it. I don't see it much different than any other

company do this, when did they do that.

Obviously, he got that from some document.

MR. BRENNER:  It's a little different when the companies did it because that wouldn't be hearsay.

MR. FURR:  It's one thing to say, when did the companies do this, when did the companies do that, even what the companies say, because that's a different type of exception to the hearsay rule.  When you ask when an outside entity did something, it's one thing.  If you preface it by basically when did an outside entity say this, you're both introducing the fact that they said something --

THE COURT:  Is it okay for him to ask when did the National Cancer Institute change its position on filters.

MR. FURR:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Let him ask that question.

MR. GDANSKI:  I have much more to ask. I'll ask that more and more.

THE COURT:  That's saying just ask it anyway.

MR. HAMMER:  I understand, but counsel's argument is like saying you can't say, they won't be able to ask them if that, with that line of argument, when did the U.S. Government change its position on the warnings on the sides of the packs of cigarettes.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's what's going on here.

MR. HAMMER:  They're trying to keep stuff out that they know very full well that they're going to try to get in on their case.  And we know that, in fact, it is admissible.  That's why we don't object to those kinds of questions because those kinds of questions are admissible. It sets the tone for the historical -- the science of tobacco and health and its effects on the public.  All that stuff is admissible. That's why we asked these questions this morning, Judge.  Quite frankly, Judge, they've been objecting to things that have never been objected to in other trials.  I respectfully --

MR. FURR:  That doesn't help his argument at all.

Court is being taken advantage of.  Because

these questions are asked routinely, and we

don't have to have as many sidebars in any of

these other trials as we've had in this case

because these questions are asked all the time

without objection.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't know.  All I can

do is do one trial at a time.

MR. HAMMER:  I understand.

THE COURT:  So let's just go and see what

happens.

MR. BRENNER:  Don't let our silence on the

charges they make just about every sidebar mean

that we agree with them because we don't.

MR. GDANSKI:  I would never take anything

to be an aversion to an agreement.  I'm being

facetious.  Obviously we don't agree.

Q    Has the Surgeon General � I will represent to you in opening statement �

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, has the Public Health

Community concluded that filtered cigarettes are not

safer than unfiltered cigarettes?

A    Yes, they've concluded that. Q    Has the Public Health Community had to go back, address, hey, why, why over the course of many years, did we make these recommendations in the '70s and '80s that people should switch to filters? A    They have done that.

Q    What do you know?  What do we know about that subject?

A    Well, we know that for decades they were misled, the Public Health Community was misled, and that through research, release of documents, they were able to discover the truth.

MR. GDANSKI:  And I have a slide.  I'll tell you from where it appears.  I'd like to put it on the ELMO for a moment.

MR. FURR:  Put that down. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  As Your Honor has observed, counsel continues to passively aggressively defy your rulings.  That's a copy of a slide used in my opening statements.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's his slide.

MR. FURR:  Everybody already knows it.  It was shown to the jury.  They clearly will have an opportunity to remember that I used this.

Once again, despite your clear rulings, counsel is pushing the boundaries and defying the rulings and wants to put a demonstrative from my opening statement in front of the witness and ask the witness to say Furr lied to the jury.  That's what he is doing.

MR. GDANSKI:  Mr. Furr objects to me showing his slide and pointing out that his slide was wrong.  That's what lawyers do. That's what you do in trial.  That's what a trial lawyer does.

THE COURT:  You can do that as to evidence, not as to opening statements.  Otherwise, it is argumentative.

about his opening statements.  Just like I don't

want him arguing about your opening statements.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  Counsel, can you guys approach

again one more time?

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  That's when you do a closing.

In closing you say he didn't meet his burden.

He told you an opening statement and he didn't

do it and this is the facts.  This isn't the

time for that.  Save that for closing.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  But you can

only do it in closing if you get the evidence

during the case.

ways .

Page 3460 tobacco companies to develop filtered cigarettes and

caused the Public Health Community to be misled?

A    Yes, that's why I think they did recommend filters.

Q    Did the Public Health Community report that filtered cigarettes were safer because the tobacco companies lied to the Public Health Community?

A    I think that's why they recommended filters.  They had bad information.

Q    Did the Public Health Information encourage the public to switch to filtered cigarettes in the

50s, '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s because the tobacco companies lied.

A    It's certainly clear that there was a deception.

Q    So we talked a tremendous amount about advertising.  And do you know who Robert Heiman was?

A    Yes.

Q    Who is Robert Heiman?

A    He was the president of the American Tobacco Company.  He had an important role as assistant to the president of the American Tobacco Company in the 1950s and '60s and rose to the rank of president.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  I don't know if you want to take a break.  I don't know if � this is getting lengthy, the arguments �

THE COURT:  I was going to give the jury a 10-minute break at 20 after 3:00 until about 3:30, but I can give it to them now.  Remember, we're probably only going to be able to go until 4:45 today.  So �

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's just break now.

THE COURT:  � I told the jury yesterday we were going to be done before 5:00.  And I have an event tonight, so we need to be done I 4:45.

I can give them a recess now.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.

THE COURT:  We can discuss this, and then we'll go until 4:45.  And whatever the last question is at 4:45, we're done.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) (Thereupon, a recess was had at 3:00 p.m., after which the proceedings continued in Volume 25.)

Don't communicate with each other or with any third parties or with any electronic devices about the case.  We're going to take a recess. You can use the restroom or if you need a snack or whatever you need.  Then we'll proceed until about 4:45 when you come back.  Thank you. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  The witness can step down and use the restroom.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir. (Thereupon, the witness exited the courtroom.) THE COURT:  Okay.  What's the issue? MR. GUEST:  The issue is, Your Honor, with showing this deposition during Dr. Proctor's testimony for a variety of reasons.  Let me give

Page 3469 you a little bit of background, if I could.  Two

seconds.

This is a former CEO of American Tobacco Company.  The deposition was taken in the case of Mississippi involving different allegations than obviously the Engle case.  In fact, it was obviously before an Engle case ever was tried or before the class action was ever filed.

So what happened was the Plaintiff in that case, in this Mississippi case in 1986, wanted to take a deposition the American Tobacco Company CEO.  Instead of doing that.  The parties to that lawsuit agreed that.  Instead of doing that, they would allow Robert Heiman, who was depicted in this deposition, the former CEO, to be deposed, and that his testimony in that deposition would be effectively pursuant to the stipulation the position of American Tobacco Company from the years 1980 to 1986.  So a discovery deposition was taken in that case, and pursuant to a stipulation it was just in that case and I think two other cases.  One was in Jersey, one was in Texas.

So now what the plaintiffs want to do is they want to claim that this is a party

Page 3470 admission because he was the former CEO of

American Tobacco Company.  And our position on

that, Your Honor, is that's just not accurate

because he was not testifying as a 30(b) (6)

witness pursuant to Mississippi law that's

pointed out in the deposition, of which I have a

copy of if you would like to see that, instead

the only reason he was testifying for American

Tobacco is because of the stipulation.

As plaintiff's counsel know, you cannot enforce a stipulation if you're not a party to it.  There's case law on it.  I can provide that to Your Honor as well.

The issue is this is not a party opponent, there was no 30(b)(6).  It was a stipulations limited to this particular case.

Number two, Your Honor, this is hearsay.

THE COURT:  When you say it wasn't a party opponent, this CEO was not a CEO of any of the companies at the table today?

MR. GUEST:  Yes, Your Honor, he was at one point in time the CEO of American Tobacco Company.  At the time of his deposition, he had not worked at American Tobacco Company for six years.

Page 3471 The stipulation that was entered into for

this particular case in Mississippi allowed him

to testify on American Tobacco's behalf.  But

that's not a 30(b) (6) deposition.  If it was, it

would be a totally different scenario, and I

would not be making this argument right now.

THE COURT:  Your argument is that he was not speaking on behalf of the corporation -- he was speaking on behalf of the corporation pursuant to a stipulation, but that doesn't make him generally availability for other people.

MR. GUEST:  Exactly, Your Honor.  As a matter of fact, I made the same argument to Judge Sasser last year in the Halliburton case, and she agreed with me.  And I have a copy of the transcript I'd be happy to hand up.

THE COURT:  Are there any DCA cases, Florida DCA cases that address this issue that you're aware of?

MR. GUEST:  I think this is a unique situation.  The short answer is no, not that I'm aware of.

THE COURT:  I guess just quick thinking, my analysis, just in my own brain right now, that I'm thinking is, even though it was by

stipulation it still was a statement of a party

opponent, wasn't it?

MR. GUEST:  That's not our position, Your Honor.  I actually disagree with that.

THE COURT:  I know that's not your position.  But in the absence of a case that says that it's pursuant to stipulation, it's not � at the time it was given, it was a statement made by the corporation.

MR. GUEST:  But only by virtue of the stipulation the parties agreed to forego the plaintiff in that case from subpoenaing the current CEO and taking his deposition.

THE COURT:  Does the stipulation say that they could not be used in any other case?

MR. GUEST:  I have a copy of the stipulation.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll read it to Your Honor. It says comes now the American Tobacco Company through counsel and stipulates to the Court that the position of the American Tobacco Company on issues of smoking and health from 1980 until the present are exactly as expressed in the deposition of Robert K. Heiman.

Page 3473 That is the stipulation that I'm aware of.

I know that the law in Florida under 90.803.18B

provides that a statement is admissible if it

was offered against a party and it is a, quote,

statement of which the party has manifested an

adoption or belief in its truth.  We take

90.803.18B, and you add the stipulation I just

read to you, and this is not even a close call.

This is not complicated.

THE COURT:  Let me see the stipulation and read me 90.803 or whatever it is again.

MR. GDANSKI:  90.803.18B provides that a statement is admissible if it is offered against a party.  So I'm going to parenthetically make my argument as I go through the rule, okay.

90.803 provides that a statement, that's Mr. Heiman's statement, is admissible if it's offered against a party, American Tobacco Company, the Defendant here in this case, and is a quote, statement of which the party, American Tobacco Company, has manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.  That's the stipulation. It's one plus one plus one equals three.  It's not so complicated.

THE COURT:  Then what is the � let me see

MR. GUEST:  Yes, sir.  I can hand this up to you, if I may approach.  It's on page 4.  At the occupy outset of the deposition the parties give the parameters of the stipulation, the nature of the stipulation, the fact that it's not a 30(b) (6) deposition, and the cases that the stipulation provided for that Mr. Heiman's deposition could be used in.

MR. GDANSKI:  It says not to be used in the Shulman case.

THE COURT:  You said there was another transcript from the Sasser?

MR. GUEST:  Yes, Your Honor.  If I can hand this up.  If I may approach again.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I would just note if that stipulation is to be interpreted, we should also inform the Court of the many, many, many dozens of case in which this has been played in exactly the same format that I have been doing now.

Judge Sasser's ruling aside, I'll trade introduction of the Surgeon General's report, which he permits, for this right now, if they want to adopt Judge Sasser's rulings.

MR. BRENNER:  I couldn't hear you.

MR. FURR:  I couldn't hear you.

MR. GDANSKI:  He couldn't hear me because when they want to use Judge Sasser as an offensive weapon, they are happy to do it.  But when it comes time to using those rulings, they're of course not going to use it.

THE COURT: I'm sorry, I missed all of that. What were you saying about one of my colleagues?

MR. BRENNER:  It was an inside �

MR. GDANSKI:  I was making the observation that Judge Sasser permits the introduction of Surgeon General's reports, as best that I am aware, in the trial I tried before her last November, a year ago today, and other evidentiary issues.  And when it comes to some of her issues and rulings, they would certainly advocate, Your Honor, to not follow them.

I will offer to make a deal right now.  I will not use this, in accordance with Judge Sasser's ruling, provided they agree to the introduction of Surgeon General's reports in accordance with Judge Sasser's rulings.  They

because they want to get the best of every

single ruling, including this Court.

MR. BRENNER:  Judge, I think all of the parties are comfortable with you making the rulings in this case.

THE COURT:  I don't think Judge Sasser is trying this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  She is not.

THE COURT:  It does say that the deposition is not being taken pursuant to 30(b) (6) .

MR. GDANSKI:  It's being taken as a person who they've manifested a belief in all that he has to say.  It doesn't need to be a 30(b) (6) . They've gone past and outside the bounds of that by saying we accept and adopt everything that he says exactly our position.

THE COURT:  When did they do that?

MR. GDANSKI:  In the stipulation I handed to Your Honor.  And when it was read into the record, that's what it stipulates to.

THE COURT:  Where is the stipulation at in this transcript?

MR. GUEST:  It's a separate document.  I have an extra copy.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, this is it right here where Mr. Davis starts talking.  It states, quote, comes now, in the middle of the page.

THE COURT:  Who is Mr. Davis?

MR. GDANSKI:  He's an attorney for one of the parties.  He's reading the stipulation into the record.

THE COURT:  American Tobacco is a party to this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

MR. GUEST:  By virtue of Reynolds being a successor of interest.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's a simple yes to that one.

MR. GUEST:  Thanks, Jon.

Oh, actually, I guess before I do that, let me tell you on this ruling.  I think the fact that Mr. Davis made it clear on the record that they agree with these statements -- I don't see any � I view this as a statement by a party opponent, and I don't see anything here that would indicate otherwise.  It was adopted by Mr. Davis's counsel on behalf of the � of the American Tobacco Company.

The fact that there was a stipulation regarding allowing him to do that for that purpose doesn't mean that at the time it was not adopted as a statement by a � it was not a statement by a party opponent.  So I'll allow it to be used as a statement by party opponent.

MS. RUIZ:  If I can be heard on that. Liggett was not a party to that case.  It's not an admission as to Liggett.  Liggett didn't participate in this.

THE COURT:  Then I think it's very clear that it should be only as to -- who does it apply to?  Reynolds?

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    We were talking about this individual

Robert Heiman.

A    Yes.

Q    He gave a deposition where he was speaking

for American Tobacco Company.  And that company is

now owned by R.J. Reynolds, right?

A    Yes.

Q    He wasn't the CEO of Liggett or Philip Morris, right?

A    No.

Q    But along with American and Reynolds Liggett and Philip Morris were part of a co-conspiracy, right?

A    Yes.  Mr. Heiman is part of the executive committee of the conspiracy.

Q    Very good.  We have several clips from his deposition.  Those are in evidence.  We've dealt with that.  That's RH � PT 1691, RH2 and RH3.

We're going to play those. (Thereupon, the following video clip was played for the jury:)

Q    Does advertising play a role in a person's selection of a cigarette?

A    We hope so when we advertise.  It's difficult to confirm this, but we do make the effort and I think it's fair to assume that the expenditure of large funds for advertising does give status to a brand, and, therefore, influences some people to select that brand.

Q    And the reason is that American disagrees with their warnings, isn't it?

A    They certainly do.

Q    You don't think they harm smokers?

A    We believe our product is not injurious to health.

Q    As far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

A    I would use the term "misguided."

Q    If he's misguided, I take it your opinion is he's wrong?

A    I was simply trying to be polite about it.

Q    Not being polite about it, in your opinion, he's wrong, right?

A    Dead wrong.

Q    Congress is wrong requiring these warnings,

Q    Did you know that each one of those health organizations has concluded cigarette smoking is hazardous to your health?

A    Without tying me to each and every one, I'm familiar with the fact that most of them have denounced cigarettes at one time or another.

Q    Is it your opinion that all of these organizations are wrong?

A    Yes.

Q    During your tenure with � it was not only Americans' position, but your position, that cigarettes weren't injurious to health; is that accurate?

Q    Dr. Proctor, there's one clip in there where they ask him if the Surgeon General's warnings are wrong, he says they're dead wrong.

Q    As it relates to the warnings that went on cigarettes, did the industry ever voluntarily put any warning or caution statement on the cigarette?

MR. GDANSKI:  I didn't cut him off.

MR. FURR:  Let him make the objection so you can understand why we're objecting.

MR. BRENNER:  Anything to do with warnings, Your Honor, we put on what the government tells us to do.  We don't put on anything more, can't put on anything less.

The suggestion here, the question is do we voluntarily put on the warnings on the 1965 cigarette packs.  That's actually one that � I'll say that's one -- the question I would not expect to be asked the way it was asked.

something.  Because sometimes things are not

MR. BRENNER:  Sure.  I will bring it.

If they want to ask � they could ask if you � before the government issued warnings, prior to the preemption, did they put warnings on voluntarily.  I think that's a fine question. Maybe that's where he was going.

THE COURT:  Your question has to do with before the labels were required to be on there. It doesn't -- once they were required to do it, they had to put it on there.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

THE COURT:  So to ask a fair question, it has to be before the law required it.  So before the law required it, did they voluntarily put any type of label or warnings on it.  That's the question.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think it's just the opposite, quite frankly.  Of course before the law required it, when there were no warning labels, they didn't put warning labels.

THE COURT:  That was voluntary.  It had to be before the law.  Once the law was put in place, it wasn't voluntary anymore.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's the point I'd like to make to the jury, that they did it because they

the jury is necessarily aware of.  Many, many

people, Judge -- we're done this before.  Many

THE COURT:  I have sustained the objection. You may ask the question:  Before warning labels were required, did they ever voluntarily do so. Because that's the only question that really deals with voluntariness.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can ask if they opposed Congress requiring warning labels.

MR. BRENNER:  No, that goes to more prejudice.

MR. GDANSKI:  Why not?

THE COURT:  I have ruled.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   Before the tobacco companies were forced to put warning labels on the sides of cigarettes by Congress, before they were forced to do that, did they ever voluntarily do that at all?

A    No.

Q    Once Congress required, forced them to put these statements on the side of the packs � by the way, are these attributional statements?

A    After 1970, the warnings are attributed to the Surgeon General.  Prior to that time, there's not an attribution.

Q    What does that mean, "attribution"?

A    It means the language of the 1970 forward warning was Surgeon General's warning, rather than just a statement of something being true.

Q    And did the tobacco companies � I'm talking about the 1966 caution statements, okay? Before you get after that, okay?

A    Yes.

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do you know what role, if any, the tobacco

companies played in the genesis of the caution

statements on cigarettes?

MR. FURR:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have the companies ever, since Congress

required them to put warnings or caution statements

on the side of cigarette packs, have they ever put on

any kind of additional warning information about �

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Judge, can we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  The objection is preemption.

Mr. Gdanski, again, knowingly just violated your

ruling on preemption.

THE COURT:  I thought we were very clear on

this when we just had the sidebar.

MR. FURR:  Yes, we were.

Page 3491 MR. GDANSKI:  That they didn't put anything

more than Congress required.  They can.  There

is nothing that stops these companies from

putting on information above and beyond the

warnings.  The fact of the matter is they did.

I had a pack of the Marlboros right here in my

hand right now that has additional warning

information above and beyond what Congress

required.  There's nothing that stopped them.

Is this against the law to put on the side of

the pack in the wrapping?

THE COURT:  Does the regulations that tobacco companies are required to follow, by way of the warnings, specify exactly what is allowed, or were you allowed to put more warnings than is required?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's an excellent question. It says what is allowed, and it never ever stops them from putting more.  One company, Liggett, put more.  Philip Morris put more for a little while.

MR. FURR:  I think the question was directed to me.

MR. GDANSKI:  I gave a truthful answer.

THE COURT:  The questions was directed to

MR. GDANSKI:  No, I answered the question.

MR. FURR:  Here is the situation.  I will hand to the Court --

MR. GDANSKI:  What's the answer to the question?

MR. FURR:  If Mr. Gdanski will stop interrupting.  I will hand to the Court a copy of Lorillard versus Reilly, a Supreme Court of the United States case of 1991.  I've highlighted something on page 9 which lays outside the basic statutory framework under which Congress adopted the preemption statute.

I am not finished.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think the answer to Your Honor's last question is exactly as I gave it. Nothing stops them from putting on anything more.  Nothing stops them from putting on anything more.  That's what I asked about.  They won't even disagree with that principle of law which is why they're silent on the issue.

MR. FURR:  Congress established a framework under which the warnings mandated by Congress

Page 3493 after January 1st, 1970, are adequate as a

matter of law and no liability can be placed on

the companies for failure to say more or

something different.  The companies have no duty

to provide any additional information to the

public.  That's Black letter law.  That's

Ciccone.  That's Lorillard V. Reilly.

That means we have no duty to provide any additional information beyond the warning. Therefore, the question as to whether we have done so is irrelevant because we have no duty to do so and liability cannot be premised upon our failure to do so.

MR. GDANSKI:  No one is talking about liability or duty.  They can do so.

THE COURT:  What issue does it go to, Mr. Gdanski?

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to how much information smokers had about the dangers of cigarettes.

THE COURT:  That doesn't go to any issues being tried in this case, does it?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think defense would agree with me that that's the main premise of this.

THE COURT:  If no other tobacco company,

table, do not put anything additional on there,

but they're following what Congress required,

how could that go to either reprehensibility or

punitive damages or liability in this case?

MR. HAMMER:  Let me explain.  The fact is the companies did.  They are --

THE COURT:  So?

MR. HAMMER:  They're not required to do so, but they did.

THE COURT:  How does it go to one of those issues that I said?

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, the issue in this case is what was known out there in the public, did the tobacco companies conceal information, what did they tell them, and what did they not tell them.

And so the tobacco companies, and this is perfect example, Marlboro, Philip Morris put on the wrapper that is removed additional writing that they weren't required to do.  They used that.

I'm about to say is I think 100 percent

consistent with the law.  They could have told

smokers more.  Nothing stopped them from telling

smokers more.  Instead they chose not to.  They

want to say that what they told --

THE COURT:  That would be an appropriate question that you already asked and answered and that question was:  Before you were required to put these warnings on there �

MR. GDANSKI:  But why does it stop there?

THE COURT:  � did you voluntarily put them on there?

You've asked that question and gotten an answer to it already, right?  So what happens afterwards, I don't see how that goes to the issue of punitives or any relevant issue in this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to comparative fault. How much are they at fault?  How much is my smoker at fault?  They could have informed smokers more.  They could have done it legally within the confines of regulatory authority and they chose not to or sometimes they chose to.

MR. FURR:  1975.

MR. GDANSKI:  Arguably also 1995.  That doesn't make a difference.  He certainly was smoking after warnings came on the packs.  This is not complicated.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, may I direct you to a portion of that?

The opinion you have there, Lorillard v. Reilly, the highlighted portion, the Supreme Court is absolutely clear on this.  This is Black letter preemption law.  We have no duty, no liability to be opposed for our failure to say anything more on the pack than what we say.

THE COURT:  So Lorillard versus Reilly, which is a U.S. Supreme Court case says, In the preemption provision, Congress unequivocally

statements on cigarette packages beyond those

provided.

MR. GDANSKI:  May I see that for a second? They are misleading the Court.  They are misleading the Court, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'm just reading what's highlighted.  Given that that's a statement of law, then why should I allow that question?

MR. GDANSKI:  Hold on a second.  This is a 39-page opinion with three lines highlighted.

THE COURT:  Those might be the most important lines.

MR. GDANSKI:  Do you know what else would be incredibly important?  Is Philip Morris going to say when we put this on the side of the pack, they violated the law?  No.  Nothing stops them from putting more on the sides of packs.

THE COURT:  They opened up the door by getting into that.  That might open the door for you.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I would just add in, what Mr. Gdanski said in response to your question, which is � your question, I believe, was:  What issue does it go to in the case?  He

Page 3498 says comparative fault.  So what he's saying is

by not putting on additional labels, that is an

element of fault.

Nothing could be more clearly preempted. That is the clearest illustration of preemption I've ever heard, which is I'm seeking to hold you at fault and liable for failing to put on additional warnings. That is their position, Your Honor.  That is the direct preemption rule.

MR. FURR:  What you have not heard, Your Honor, you have not heard the plaintiff dispute my ascertain that we have no legal duties to put on anything additional and Congress has insulated the companies from liability for failure do so.  They will not dispute that because it is indisputable.

MR. GDANSKI:  What you have not heard from Mr. Furr is, despite the fact that they have no legal duty, they can, and some companies have, put on additional statements of warnings on the sides of packs.  They know that.

THE COURT:  But how does that go to any � first of all, based on that U.S. Supreme Court case, how does that go to any pertinent issue in this case?

Q    Tobacco companies, they were forced to put

that on?

Q    All right.  Between 1966, when the tobacco

companies were forced to put that caution statement

that cigarettes may be hazardous to your health on

the sides of packs, could they have put on a stronger

one?

Page 3504 could have and should have done it from 1966 on.

So we would like some instruction from the Court that Mr. Gdanski's questions are limited from a time period of 1966 to 1969.

MR. GDANSKI:  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I asked the questions.  Mr. Furr even asked for a date period on the questions, I said, what year, 1966.  They didn't say a single word.

THE COURT:  If that's what you did, there's no damage for me to clarify to say those questions were limited from '66 to '69.  What's the big deal?

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, you're commenting on the evidence.  You're commenting on the evidence.  And by doing that, you're �

THE COURT:  I'm going to instruct �

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think it is.  I think it's commenting on the evidence and injecting yourself �

THE COURT:  I am going to sustain and strike your stuff and make you do it all over again.  Is that what you want me to do?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll do it all over again.

THE COURT:  Is that what you want me to do?

Page 3505 MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I think that counsel

is asking Your Honor to intercede and to comment

on the evidence.  And I'll do it all over again.

I'll do the whole thing again.

MR. BRENNER:  If he does it the same way again, it's going to be the same objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Maybe object when I ask the question.

MR. BRENNER:  Because we thought you were going to do what the Judge instructed.  You asked for the next three years.

MR. GDANSKI:  Mr. Furr asked me what year, confine it to the year, explain the year.

THE COURT:  I'll strike all of the last several sets of questions and you'll have to start all over again and do it all over again because you won't allow me to do an instruction telling them that your questions were related to 1966 to '69.  If that's what you want me to do, that's what I'll do.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't understand what's happening.  That's the answer for the Court, I don't understand what's happening.

THE COURT:  They're moving to strike it because you didn't limit it to '66 through '69.

MR. GDANSKI:  Why do I have to.  I said in 1966 �

THE COURT:  That's what we said in sidebar.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's say I only want to talk about the year 1966 because I think it's important.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, no, no.  Let's just say I want to limit --

THE COURT:  You can go before '66 all the way to '69.

MR. GDANSKI:  Why can't I limit my question to one year?  Why do I have to ask in the confines of when they want me to ask my questions.  It's my direct for my client.  Why can't I ask just about 1966 or 1926 or '67.  I don't have to be bound by the way they want me to ask questions to make their points on my

THE COURT:  Mr. Gdanski, can you stop for a second so I can read this?

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

THE COURT:  All right.  So the questions seem to be limited to the year time periods until we get to these questions.  Then we get to -- and instead of putting the truth, did they withhold the truth?  They concealed it.  They withheld it.  And that was related to the prior questions was about 1966.  Then the next question is, Dr. Proctor, for how long did the company -- which I guess is the one you're objecting to.  How long did the companies withhold the truth about nicotine being addictive?  And it says many decades.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a finding.  That's a finding.  That's got nothing to do with the warning.

MR. FURR:  The questions that Mr. Gdanski asked about '66 were all predicated on the warning.  Then he asks the following questions. So the clear implication of those questions read together is that Dr. Proctor is criticizing us

warning.

THE COURT:  The objection is really to the last question.  Which is � right before the objection, which was:  Dr. Proctor, for how long did the companies withhold the truth about nicotine being addictive?

Many decades.

What I think that they're saying is that because he didn't say � he didn't explain which decades he's referring to, presumptively the answer would be many decades up until 1969.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, Judge, the answer is 1999.  That's a finding.  They did continue to conceal information about the addictiveness.  It has nothing to do with the warnings.  There's a finding in this case that they concealed information about the addictiveness totally 100 percent separate from warnings.

THE COURT:  Why would this be objectionable?

MR. GDANSKI:  None of it is objectionable. They just don't like this.

MR. FURR:  All of this was based -- we came up here because Mr. Gdanski wanted to circumvent

back and asked the question �

THE COURT:  The warnings were based on the years.

MR. FURR:  Sixty-six.

MR. GDANSKI:  The question was about a year when everything I asked appropriately.

MR. FURR:  The question about the warning label in '66.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, don't make a representation to the Court.

Judge, find that question.

THE COURT:  I asked you guys numerous times to not talk over each other.

MR. FURR:  Here is what happened.  What he did was he morphed from the '66 warning into a broader question, clearly hoping the jury will interpret that in the context of warnings.

imposed on the defendants for the failure to

provide additional or different warnings after

July 31st, 1969.

THE COURT:  I don't see that question. What I see here, this is all I have in front of me, the last question, which I think he had already segued away from that, was could the companies � Dr. Proctor, for how long did the companies withhold the truth about nicotine being addictive?

He answered many decades.

And Mr. Gdanski's proffer is that -- is that they have some evidence that's already been presented, which I believe I've heard some evidence of that, that there's some witnesses that are saying � or this witness, I guess, is saying that it was many decades that they were withholding the information.

How does that have anything to do with --

MR. GDANSKI:  And the Engel findings.

MR. FURR:  Because what we have to do is back up two questions and look at page 153, line 17.  First question:  What could the companies

nicotine addiction in 1966?

And the answer:  They could have put the truth on the packs.

Question:  Instead of putting the truth, did they withhold the truth?

The answer:  They concealed it.  They withheld.

Question:  For how long did the company withhold the truth about nicotine being addictive?

Many decades.

Clearly in the context of the warning labels.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, Judge �

MR. FURR: Those two questions were follow-ups on the original warning label questions.

THE COURT:  It does say, And instead of putting the truth, did they withhold the truth? For how long did the companies withhold the truth?  It does appear to be misleading.

MR. GDANSKI:  Every question here is independent, Judge.  They need to object if they have a problem with a question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, everything I did was perfectly appropriate.

THE COURT:  Here is what I'm going to do. I'm going sustain the objection as to only one guestion and one answer, and that is: Dr. Proctor, for how long did the companies withhold, for many decades.  I'll strike it and then you can ask an appropriate follow-up guestion that does not link it to the prior guestion as this one does.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sustaining an objection to one of the last guestions that was asked and answered, which was:  Dr. Proctor, for how long did the companies withhold the truth about nicotine being addictive?

Answer:  Many decades.

Please, Counsel, ask your next question.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, have you examined the broad

scope of time in which the tobacco companies misled

the American public, including smokers, about the

addictiveness of nicotine and cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    For how long did that take place?

A    Many decades.

Q    Okay.  Many decades.  That could be the

20s, '30s, and '40s, or the '40s, '50s, and '60s.

For how long specifically with time

components on it?

A    Well, the first evidence of internal

knowledge of addiction that I've found is from 1953,

where in one of these Plaza Hotel meetings it said,

Fortunately for us, cigarettes are a habit they can't

break.  Smokers can't break the habit.

The tobacco -- there's no tobacco company

admitted addiction for over 40 years after that.

Q    I'11 break it down for you.

In the 1970, 1980s, 1990s, did the tobacco

companies continue to mislead the American public and

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    In the 1970s, '80s, '90s, did the tobacco companies withhold information and mislead the American public regarding nicotine being addictive?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they know in the 1990s that it was addictive internally?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they lie to the American public and say it was not?

addictive?

A    They did.

Q    Did they do it through their lawyers in

A    Lawyers, executives.

Q    CEOs?

A    CEOs, yes.

Q    Children, did they publicly maintain, we

A    That's what they said to the public.

MR. GDANSKI:  We introduce PT 6017-8.

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. FURR:  We're checking now, Your Honor.

No objection.

THE COURT:  All right.  6017.

So that exhibit is admitted into evidence

without objection.

(Exhibit 6017 was admitted into evidence.)

Q    Dr. Proctor, where does this come from?

A    This is from an R.J. Reynolds advertisement placed in many newspapers from the 1980s.  R.J. Reynolds.

Q    It says, We don't advertise to children, who are you kidding.  Newspaper magazines and billboards are filled with cigarette ads.  Kids can't help but see them.

That's true, right?

A    That is true.

Q    Still true today?

A    Well, not billboards.

Q    I'm sorry, not billboards. Magazines? MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, to

present advertising practices. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    How can you expect us to believe that you're not trying to reach and influence our children?  That's asked � that's a rhetorical question.

A    It's a rhetorical question.

have made them totally cynical about our industry.

Nevertheless, we'd like to set the record straight.

First of all, we don't want young people to smoke.

Is that a lie?

A    It's not consistent with the truth.

Q    Not consistent with the truth.

We're running ads aimed specifically at young people, advising them that we think smoking is strictly for adults.

Second, research shows that among all of the factors that influence a young person to start smoking, advertising is insignificant. This is from Reynolds?

A    That's what it says.

Q    At the time they were spending billions of dollars in advertising?

A    Hundreds of millions.

Q    Hundreds of millions?

A    On advertising and promotion, yes.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, would a company spend billions of dollars in advertising if it had an insignificant effect?

A    No.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's

not a proper subject for expert testimony. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Kids just don't pay attention to cigarette ads and that's exactly as it should be.

Finally, Dr. Proctor, this kids don't pay attention to cigarette ads and that's exactly how it should be, what do your studies and your knowledge tell us about whether or not kids pay attention to cigarette ads?

A    Well, the whole point is advertising is unconscious.  It doesn't really matter whether they pay attention.  The point is it has an impact regardless of whether they pay attention.

Q    Finally, sometimes it's hard for people

Page 3519 outside the marketing field to understand.  All of

our cigarette ads are what we call brand advertising. Its purpose is to get smokers of competitive products to switch to one our brands and to build the loyalty of those who already smoke our brands. Do you see that? A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  At present, there are some 200 different cigarette brands for sale in the U.S many of them have only a very small fraction of the total cigarette market.  Getting smokers to switch is virtually the only way a cigarette brand can meaningfully increase its business.  That's why we don't advertise to young people.  Of course if you'd like to share this ad with your children, that would be fine with us.

Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco industry advertise to young people? A    They did.

Q    Is there any doubt about that? A    No, that's a historical fact. Q   Have they ever admitted that? MR. BRENNER:  Objection. MR. FURR:  Objection. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q    Have they consistently denied that?

A    They have.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 4014, we'd move that into evidence.

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. FURR:  Yes, we have an objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do we need to take that up now?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'd like to use the document. I don't know how else to do it.

THE COURT:  All right.  Then you need to approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. GUEST:  The public document that Mr. Gdanski has just shown the witness regarding advertisement was from the 1980s.  Now he wants to show him documents from the 1920s to start this whole chain of events of how he's going to parade in front of Dr. Proctor a bunch of internal documents with respect to whether or not the tobacco companies had advertising plans and what it means for people under the age of 18.

There are numerous objections to this

it's because of the prejudicial value of showing

these documents to the jury to create an

impression, nothing more that the companies did

something wrong and did so for a lot of decades.

It has nothing to do with this case, Your Honor.  There is absolutely zero evidence --

THE COURT:  These documents are from the 1920s?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Ones that showed warnings �

MR. GDANSKI: Your Honor overruled this motion pretrial on youth marketing. Denied, when it came up in Dr. Figuereo's deposition designation --

THE COURT:  When was Mr. Shulman born?

MR. GUEST:  He was born in the 1920s.  We had deposition testimony from him and from his wife that there was no impact of advertising to him.

This document in particular is just some jittery memorandum.  It's not tied to any specific geographic location or anything like that.  The point, Your Honor, it's not relevant to any of the issues in the case because

reprehensibility issue.

But number one, it has no connection --

THE COURT:  Could there be a possibility that Mr. Shulman could have seen it as a child?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's an internal memorandum that lays out the history of youth marketing. I'm going to do that for multiple decades going from the '20s, '30s --

THE COURT:  It's not an advertisement you are going to show?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, not from the '20s.  But I have the internal documents that demonstrate the history of their youth marketing.  Twenties, '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s and on and on.

Judge, you denied this motion pretrial. They keep coming up here.  This is not a good-faith objection.  You can preserve it, that's one thing, but we argued this ad nauseam pretrial.  Your Honor denied the motion.  This is a unique moment where they're not running up here with the pretrial order that says denied, like they've done every other time.  Your Honor denied this motion.

used this in opening statements, as well as

other youth marketing openings.  I'm going to

try as fast as possible in the next 25 minutes

to go over youth marketing.  I would like to do

it without interruption.  They can preserve

their objection to youth marketing.  I'd like to

introduce documents and show what these

companies did as far as youth marketing.  Youth

is a critical component to their business.  It

has been for the growth plan for every product

for the last 50 years, up to 1984.  Youth are

replacement smokers.  We used that in opening

statements without objection.  At some point I

want to put in my evidence.

Page 3524 Why is it overly prejudicial?

MR. GUEST:  I am about to put this all in context.  What Mr. Gdanski has been trying to set up yesterday and what he is setting up today is he wants to make the argument in closing argument that the companies made billions of dollars, that they killed millions of people, and that they marketed to kids.  Those issues are not relevant to the questions on the verdict form, and that is what Mr. Gdanski is trying to do with Dr. Proctor.

The reason why youth marketing has nothing to do with reprehensibility is, A, there is no evidence that it impacted Mr. Shulman, and, B, it does not go to concealment or agreement to conceal.

THE COURT:  There is no evidence that Mr. Shulman started smoking when he was a youth?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course there is.  14 years old.

MR. GUEST:  There is evidence that he started smoking when he was a youth, but there is no evidence that anything a tobacco company said or did had any influence on his decision to start smoking or his decision to continue

the issue, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Doesn't it still go to reprehensibility?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course.

MR. GUEST:  That's my point.  The reason is doesn't have anything to do with reprehensibility -- and I will draw a distinction for Your Honor.  This has nothing to do with reprehensibility.  Number one, Dr. Proctor said this whole concealment and conspiracy to conceal started in 1953.  This is in the 1927.

Number two, when you objected to an earlier document that actually said we don't really know what's going on with the risks of smoking to a second grade class, Your Honor said, hey, that is part of the concealment.  This is different because it doesn't go to any of those issues. It doesn't go to any of the issues in this case. It has nothing to do with the only two claims that the plaintiffs can get the punitive damages on.

MR. GDANSKI:  According to the defense, nothing has to do with any of the two claims we

crystal-clear and appropriate in this case.

Youth marketing is highly relevant.  It goes to

how the industry kept attracting smokers.  It

goes to how the industry manipulated the market.

it goes to how the industry lied and withheld

information, especially from youth, the most

susceptible demographic.

Your Honor denied this pretrial.  They are objecting to everything we want to do.  We used this in openings without objection.  There is no good-faith basis to object to this document coming in this case.  I've used it so many times in the past.  It's denied pretrial.  I don't know what else to do.

This is extremely relevant.  How they attract business, how they build up their customer base, and how they continue to do that. Your Honor asked a question �

THE COURT:  Summarize real quick.  Your arguments can be done a little more succinctly because we are running out of time and we're worried about this jury and we're never going to get through this trial.  We're going to run out of time.  Your arguments in sidebar have to be

Page 3527 more succinct.

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is the point:  The claim that the tobacco companies marketed to children obviously goes to the final question of whether or not punitive damages are warranted.  It goes to reprehensibility.  I know they don't like it, but it all does.  In the 1980s, '70s, '60s, '50s, '40s, '30s, '20s, and it does.

MR. GUEST:  Here is the pretrial order. Mr. Gdanski wasn't at the hearing and, perhaps, he missed the point.  This is without argentous. Subject to contemporaneous objection, the succinct rebuttal to what Mr. Gdanski just said is this has absolutely nothing to do with agreement to conceal or concealment and it has no bearing on the punitive damages.

THE COURT:  They are saying it goes to reprehensibility and youth marketing.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, Mr. Shulman is actually a youth at this time.  In most cases this comes in when the smoker was born in 1940. In the last case we tried, the smoker was tried in the '50s.

THE COURT:  When was he born?

MR. GDANSKI:  In the 1920.

MR. GDANSKI:  Exactly, yeah, I think.

THE COURT:  What was the year of his birth?

MR. GDANSKI:  1920.

So this is relevant, and certainly all the stuff from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s when they are conspiring is relevant too.  It's very rare you're going to get a smoker who is actually alive when this comes out.

THE COURT:  Except this was about college.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's their argument.

THE COURT:  There's no way he was at college.

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course not.  It's about attracting to the youth.  Again, I think that's Mr. Furr's point.  That goes to cross.  This is not what you contend it is.  It's not youth. But that certainly � we're allowed to make our argument through our evidence and our presentation to our questioning of our witness.

THE COURT:  That was before the conspiracy.

MR. FURR:  Yes, Your Honor.  I know that Judge Tutor in Broward County refuses to admit this document because he realizes how prejudicial this issue is and this is exactly

case.  It's a hot button �

THE COURT:  Why is it a hot button issue?

MR. FURR:  Because you are going to see a parade of documents coming in on youth marketing.  The only reason why they are doing this is because it inflames the passion of the jury.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not my fault that what they did in their documents �

MR. FURR:  This is going to be about youth marketing.  This is not a case on youth marketing.

THE COURT:  Isn't this somewhat cumulative anyway since you've got a whole bunch of other things on �

MR. GDANSKI:  No, because it exists at different moments at time.  I haven't put a single document in on youth marketing.

THE COURT:  The question is, how does it to reprehensibility if it was before the conspiracy?

MR. GDANSKI:  The conspiracy goes to their conduct.  Part of conspiring was attracting youth smokers.  Part of conspiring was

that they met and planned a course of action

isn't until 1953.  But preceding that, they also

were doing taking actions in concert with and in

furtherance of what turned out to be the

conspiracy and shaped smoking culture.

Youth didn't start smoking by accident. Youth didn't start smoking because somehow it just became the thing to do.  They shaped it. They developed it.  They created it.  This is the core of our case.  This man was smoking around this time frame.  I don't see how -- I really don't see how it's not relevant.  I think we're done.

MR. GUEST:  Two things, Your Honor. Mr. Shulman was not smoking at this time.  And Mr. Gdanski's record is not aligned with the facts given by his own witness less than two hours ago.

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the objection.  Because weighing the prejudice associated with it compared to the possible relevance of this thing, which is � seems to be minimal because it was, A, before Mr. Shulman was in college, and this was towards college.

You had advertisements that were directed at children, which that was the implication of it and that was what � and/or college-age students, because this is college-age students that we're talking about in this letter, not children anymore.  These were probably adults that it's directed at.  I'm not sure it goes to youth marketing anyway.  If you're in college anyway, you're no longer a child.

MR. GDANSKI:  Then what's so observable about it?

THE COURT: Well, because of the relevant time periods. What's your argument on that in terms of --

MR. GUEST:  That's the same point, the relevant time period.  I know how this document is used in these trials.  I guarantee -- what was the question he was asking Dr. Proctor just before we sought to introduce this argument? Did the tobacco companies market to kids.  He went through the whole litany of the tobacco companies denying this allegation and now they want to introduce this document.

Page 3533 THE COURT:  This is college students, not

kids anymore.

MR. GUEST:  It's young people.  I think you are going to see a bunch of internal documents with regard to what other people did, who the tobacco companies were observing.  And it's prep schools also, as you can see that in the first sentence.

MR. GDANSKI:  And it is youth marketing.

THE COURT:  It does say prep schools, so that would be children.  I'm sorry.

MR. GDANSKI:  So then why isn't it relevant?  Coming and going, I don't see how I lose this one.

THE COURT:  Well, because of the fact that it was before the conspiracy, so it can't really go to the reprehensibility argument.  It's before the conspiracy.  It's cumulative of other stuff that you have, that you either already have or will be putting in on youth marketing. Because you've already told me, proffered that there's going to be a whole volume of that.

MR. GDANSKI:  Which they'll object to every single one.

Q    Dr. Proctor, did tobacco companies market to high school students?

A    They did.

Q    This is the Youth Research Institute, 1959. What's taking place here?

A    They're looking at the rate at which high schoolers smoke, showing that over half of high school kids by their senior year are already smoking.

Q    It says, Preference-wise Camel and Winston are shown as holding their shares substantially constant, while Salem increased its share especially among who?

A    High school students.

Q    What was the Youth Research Institute?

A   That was one of the bodies that developed exact data on the rate in which people had been smoking by freshman year high school and junior in high school.

Q    In doing that, did they actually study the demographics of how many people or percentage of people were smoking in high school and colleges at

What did they do to try to generate this study?

Q    What have you found?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, there's been a lot of advertising to youth, and it does cause youth smoking. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    How long has that been the case? A    It's been the case forever. Q    Let's go to page 2 of this.

High school students, just tell the jury what we're looking at on page 2 here.

A    These are the Youth Research Institute data showing that for all high school students in 1958, 58 percent were smoking.  Just in the freshman and sophomore classes, nearly half were smoking.  And by the junior and senior years, the last two years of high school, nearly two-thirds of all of these high school students were smoking --

Q    And what I'd like to do � A    -- cigarettes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2003.  I'd like to move that into evidence.

A    It says, The base of our business is the high school student.

Q    Is that true, Dr. Proctor?  The base of the tobacco's business was the high school student?

A    That's always been true.  It's increasingly true over time.

Q    Over time, it's increasingly true.

You're familiar, Dr. Proctor, with someone named Diane Bureaus?

Q    Dr. Proctor, have you examined some of the

words, the ideas and the phrases that are used to

describe the youth market?

A    Yes.  That's one of the things I do, is

look at euphemisms, code words in the tobacco

context.

to a few sidebars ago, what was the time frame where

they had that ad in the paper that said we don't

A    Yes.

Q    Strategic research reports.  Have you reviewed other strategic research reports?

A    I have.

Q    What are these documents?

A    These are high-level strategy documents that are used to plan strategy for a particular company.

Q    All right.  It says younger adult smokers. You're familiar with that term, right?

A    I am.

Q    Okay.  So do we have documents � we're going to run out of time today.  We can show the jury tomorrow � that explains the evolution of just that term, those three words, "younger adult smokers"?

A    Yes.  There's an archival trace for that.

Q    What will the documents reveal and demonstrate regarding how the term "younger adult smokers" evolved over time?

Page 3543 A    That's a policy that this referred to 14-

to 21-year-old kids, but the policy is that these be

referred to, after the '70s, as young adults.  In

other words, it's a policy to make sure that the

internal documents refer to these as young adults and

not young smokers.

Q    Was it still referring to the same age group?

A    Same age group.

Q   What's the age group?

A    The critical 14- to 21-year-old is the crucial youth group that's later referred to as young adults.

Q    Is "younger adult smokers" a code word for 14 to 18?

A    It is.

Q    After this document was written, did younger adults, did youth children, 14- to 18-year-olds, continue to be important and critical to the growth of cigarette brands made by these companies?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Were youth smokers still important to R.J. Reynolds in '85, '95 and thereafter? A    Yes.

Q    It says, The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-old smokers.  No more than 5 percent of smokers start after the age of 24. Is that right?

Page 3546 A    It's rare for smokers to start out after

the age of 24.

Q   Let's go to page number 10, please.

So at this point, Dr. Proctor, hundreds of thousands of people are dying each year from smoking, right ?

A    That's true.

Q    That's bad for business, right?  Tobacco business.

A    They loose customers that way, yes.

Q    So they say, The importance of younger adult smokers.  Younger adult smokers are the only source of what?

A    Of replacement smokers.

Q    Replacement smokers.  So youth replace those who die from tobacco-related disease?

A    Yes.  It's one of about a dozen terms used for this crucial youth market.

Q    Less than one-third of smokers start after age 18.  Only 5 percent of smokers start after age 24.  If younger adults turn away from smoking, the industry must decline, just as a population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle. Do you see that, Dr. Proctor?

A    I do.

Page 3547 Q    All right.  They're calling 14- to

18-year-olds replacement smokers?

A    That's one of the many terms they use for that crucial group.

Q    Is it true, Dr. Proctor, that if the youth market didn't exist, if youth smoking didn't exist, this industry would decline?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

And we've got maybe a question or two left and that's it.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  I can do it three questions, okay, Judge?

THE COURT:  All right.  It depends on whether there's any objections to them or not. If so, you'll be asking them tomorrow. MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, what would happen if youth smoking did not exist?

A    Well, the industry would decline, just as the population that does not give birth.

Q    If you'd go to page 65, at the top it says, Younger adults importance as replacement smokers.

more, or are you done? BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, at around this same time, did they come out with Joe Camel?

A    That's about when they came out with Joe Camel.

Q    We'll talk about him tomorrow.

A    Okay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're excused for the day.  We'll have you back at about 20 after 9:00 tomorrow.

Have a nice evening. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.).

possibility we may have to move out of this courtroom.  The chief criminal judge evidently wants this courtroom back because it's a criminal courtroom, and they're having difficulty having enough criminal courtrooms.

So I'm trying to keep us in here.  I've talked to the Chief Judge Colbath.  But if we have to move, there's a possibilities we may have to move into my small courtroom and just cram in there, or we may have to see if they find something else for us.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  The ceremonial courtroom.

THE COURT:  I suggested that as an alternative.  But I'll let you know.  If so, then everybody has to move everything.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll figure it out.

the following proceedings continued from Volume 25 at 10:05

a.m.

P-R-O-C-E-E-D-I-N-G-S

THE COURT:  Okay.  So I don't know whether everybody heard the good news or bad news.  It is what we have to do, unfortunately.  We have to move to 11B, which is the courtroom next to the ceremonial courtroom.  So where we were originally for voir dire, so we are next to it. It's about the same size as this one.  It's more comfortable for the jury.  It's much better than my courtroom.  And it's a civil courtroom.

So the problem here is this one is a criminal one, and Casternackas, who is in charge of criminal division, wants it back and made that very clear to me yesterday when I walked off the bench.  Actually suggested that I go to south county, of which I told him we will not move this trial to south county.  I know all lawyers have hotel reservations right around here.  I wasn't going to do that to you guys. So this is a much better alternative than moving to south county where they had a courtroom that's empty.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=681
Page 355� So what we're going to do today is we're

going to take a two-hour � we're going to go

until 4:35 because of your constraints, and

we're going to take a two-hour lunch break,

which during the two-hour lunch break you will

eat lunch for a half hour and you will spend the

rest of the time starting to move whatever can

be moved.  We will make arrangements for the

doors to be open for that to happen.  Then

whatever else after � you can go home because

you've got your religious issues, but the rest

of the parties that are able to move things need

to be able to move things because we can't have

me moving thing Monday morning.

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is the only problem. Two hours isn't going to be enough.

THE COURT:  I'll give you a longer lunch break if we need to.  We can do two and a half hours for lunch.  I have a lunch meeting that I have to go to anyway, a committee meeting.

MR. GDANSKI:  What we had talked about � whatever you want to do is obviously fine.  What we had talked about before Your Honor took the bench, when we found out there was going to be the moving of the courtrooms, was breaking today

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=682
Page 3559 at about 3:30.  This way I don't have any

problem getting home and then the tech �

everybody can set everything up.  It might take

three hours to do the � to break down the

technology and then move it and set it back up.

So if we take a lunch break from 12:00 to 3:00

and resume at 3:00 to 4:30.

THE COURT:  Not 12 to 3.  I was thinking 11:45, somewhere around there until about 2.  I was thinking until 2:00, but I can go until 2:30.  Then we could � I could do 11:45 to somewhere between 2:00 and 2:30, and then we can go and have trial until 4:30 or at least two more hours.

You guys have to understand, juries come in for the day, okay.  They took their day off of work to be here for you guys.  I can't just tell the jury, well, we're only going to do trial for two hours in the morning, goodbye.  This is not proper.

MR. GDANSKI: No, I wasn't suggesting that. I was suggesting we should go a normal day until 3:30.

THE COURT:  I can't do that.  I have a lunch committee meeting to go to.  You have to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=683
Page 3560 take into consideration my schedule as well.

MR. PHILIPSON:  After lunch, are we going to be upstairs, or are we going to be down here? If we break down the equipment, where are we going to meet for the rest of the day after lunch?

THE COURT:  We can do it either way.  If Mark doesn't have things in the afternoon � we can call over there and find out if he's got cancellations.  If his courtroom is free for the rest of the afternoon, we could just recommence up there, if you want to just move the technology during lunch.  And then the boxes you guys can do after-hours because you probably don't need all of the boxes with you.

MR. GDANSKI:  We can't commence the trial without the technology.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's for sure.

THE COURT:  Either we stay here for the rest of the afternoon and leave the technology in place and move the boxes, or you move the technology during the lunch break, we recommence up there in the afternoon, and then the rest of the boxes that are not essential, then you move

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=684
Page 3561 those after-hours.  That's my suggestion.

MR. HAMMER:  I can tell you, I hardly think we're going to be able to break down the technology and move it to the upstairs courtroom in time to have anything done today.

THE COURT:  Even if I broke from 11:45 to 2:00?

MR. HAMMER:  Probably not.

THE COURT:  How long does it take to move that stuff?

MR. PHILIPSON:  It took us about an hour and a half the other night to refix everything. It usually takes probably 45 minutes to break it down and an hour and a half to set it up. That's with no problems.

THE COURT:  We'll stay here.

MR. HAMMER:  It would make more sense to � whenever we � after break for your lunch � we break, whenever you come back from your lunch, we resume here, and then we cut early so we can move stuff, as Jon suggested.  Only because to start moving in the middle is going to be impossible.

THE COURT:  Can't you move some boxes?  You don't need to have all of your boxes here.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=685
Page 3562 MR. GDANSKI:  It's not the boxes.  That's

the problem.  The boxes are important, yes, but

they're not necessary to the continuation of the

presentation.

THE COURT:  Can't you start moving some of the boxes during the lunch break so you have some of it moved already.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.  We can move some of the boxes.

THE COURT:  Stuff you have in your rooms, for example.

MR. HAMMER:  Sure.  But as far as the technology, that would be an impossibility.

THE COURT:  We'll break close to 11:45 � about 11:45 we'll break, and we'll pick up again at 2:00 and then.

MR. GDANSKI:  Where ?

MR. HAMMER:  Here.

THE COURT:  2:00 here.  And we will go to 4:30.  And then you guys will move the technology after-hours, and during the lunch break, you will move as many boxes as you can move .

MR. GDANSKI:  We can do that.  Just �

THE COURT:  Move all your other stuff.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=686
Page 3563 Monday morning we're going to be up there.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  We can do that.

MR. PHILIPSON:  Are we going to be there for the rest of the trial?

THE COURT:  Yes.

All right.  Are you going to try to get rooms for them up there?

THE BAILIFF:  I am working on it.

THE COURT:  And make doors open for them.

THE BAILIFF:  I'm working on it.  Right now I'm waiting on Andrea to find out if we can start moving in at lunch.

THE COURT:  We can at least move into the rooms.

THE BAILIFF:  Yes, the rooms are not a problem.

THE COURT:  I don't think Marco has got something in the afternoon.

THE BAILIFF:  She's checking right now.

THE COURT:  The other thing is that I think we'll be doing 8:45s on the 11th floor instead of in my courtroom, and he'll be doing 8:45 in my courtroom.  So motion calendar will probably take place at the same time, I'm assuming.

Page 3564 Anything else we need to take up?

MR. GUEST:  Just briefly, Your Honor.  At the end of the day yesterday, Mr. Gdanski indicated that he was going to introduce evidence of the Camel, Joe Camel marketing campaign.  We wanted to raise an objection to that based on the timing of when that advertising campaign took place.

As Your Honor knows, as we are becoming familiar with your rulings on youth marketing, Mr. Gdanski was able to put some of that evidence in yesterday.  We did not have any sidebar issues with any of those documents.  But with respect to Joe Camel specifically, this is an advertising campaign that was launched in the late '80s, the Joe Camel campaign.  And because of the timing of this advertising campaign, when Mr. Shulman had quit for almost 15 years, when he was almost 70 years old, and given the specifics of this entire marketing campaign, our position is that this is irrelevant to the issues that the jury has to decide and should not come into evidence.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is absolutely contrary to the position I had yesterday.  Your Honor

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=688
Page 3565 ruled that during the course of the conspiracy

we can discuss the scope of youth marketing.

This is right in the midst of the conspiracy.

It's at a major peak point in the conspiracy in

the mid-1980s.  Mr. Shulman's records say that

he quit when he testifies that he continued

smoking.  There's definitely evidence in this

case that he smoked up until 1995, so that's not

an issue.

THE COURT:  It still goes to the issue of reprehensibilities, is your position.

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course.  It goes to reprehensibilities.

THE COURT:  Why wouldn't it go to that issue under the case law?  I am not saying anything one way or the other.

MR. GUEST:  That's the position we've been articulating, both as we mentioned in the pretrial hearing and at sidebar a couple of times, that the issue of reprehensibility is not tied to advertising and marketing and youth because the only way they get to punitive entitlement is by concealment and agreeing to conceal, and the youth marketing and advertising has nothing to do with that.  That's

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=689
Page 3566 why we think that this is outside the realm of

reprehensibility.

But apart from that, we have an objection on relevance and also 403 grounds, given the timing of this advertising campaign.

THE COURT:  This is in the 1980s?

MR. GDANSKI:  This is exactly what Your Honor overruled yesterday.

THE COURT:  Part of the Engle findings include that time period?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course.  This is part of the conspiracy.  This is exactly how they kept out the 1920 stuff saying the conspiracy hasn't started.

THE COURT:  I recall.

MR. GDANSKI:  So now we're in the conspiracy and they are saying oh, you should �

THE COURT:  Your objection is overruled.

MR. GUEST:  Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think we can get started.

THE COURT:  Go ahead and take the witness stand, and as soon as the deputy pops his head back in, we will have him bring the jury back out.

I'm sorry about the move, guys.  I kept us

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=690
Page 3567 in the building, that's all I can say.  I

actually went down � one of the reasons I was

late yesterday is I went down to meet with the

chief judge about this yesterday because I was

concerned when there was the suggestion that we

might have to go to an empty courtroom in the

south part of the county.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a lot of moving parts.

THE COURT:  While we're waiting for the jury, is there anybody who can anticipate the next sidebar and wants to argue it now?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think we just did.

THE COURT:  Court Reporter, can you knock on that door, see if he'll hear you.

Hang on.

THE COURT REPORTER:  I can knock, I don't mind.

THE COURT:  The door doesn't go directly into the jury room.  It's a double door.

Can you bring the jury up?

THE BAILIFF:  Yes. (Thereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Be seated.  Thank you.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  Good morning. May it please the Court.

gentlemen.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Good morning, Dr. Proctor.

A    Good morning.

Q    We're going to pick up where I said we left off.  We're were talking about some of the R.J. Reynolds documents from the mid-1980s regarding youth marketing.

Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q We had finished looking at an advertisement that they put in the public domain that said we don't market to children.

A    Correct.

Q    We also looked at a document from 1984 from Diane Bureaus that talked about youth as replacement smokers.

Remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    Then I said we were going to follow up and talk about some of the marketing that was done in the 1980s from Reynolds to youth.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=692
Page 3569 A    Yes.

Q    You know who Joe Camel was?

A    Yes.

Q    Joe Camel was for which brand obviously?

A    For the Camel brand of cigarettes.

Q    When did the Joe Camel campaign come out in this country?

A    It begins in the mid-1980s, late 1980s.

Q    Do we have examples of some of the Joe Camel advertisements that were used?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  Let's take a look at some of those.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll move the Joe Camel

advertisements into evidence.

MR. FURR:  We reserve the right, of course,

to look at each one before they go into

evidence.  That's the procedure we've adopted. THE COURT:  Sure. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Let's take a look at a couple, please. Dr. Proctor, have you reviewed the popularity of the Joe Camel campaign in general and as it relates to comparisons of other iconic campaigns?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=693
Page 3570 A    Yes, the effectiveness of it.

Q    Okay.  Tell the jury, please, about what

you know about the effectiveness of the Joe Camel

campaign.

A    It helped restore some of the youth attraction of the Camel brand, which was becoming associated more with an elderly population, especially with the triumph of Marlboro.  So it was a competitive push to recapture the youth market for Camel that had been suffering.  Camel had become an old person's brand.

Q    Are you familiar with comparisons between the Joe Camel brand and Mickey Mouse? A    Yes.

Q    What do you know about that? A    Very early in the Joe Camel campaign there were �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  This calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  The answer does or the question does?

MR. GDANSKI:  It does not.

MR. FURR:  I can approach and explain this. THE COURT:  Yeah, because the question doesn't call for hearsay.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=694
Page 3571 MR. FURR:  I think it does.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think it's a well-taken objection. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  The question is:  Are you familiar with the comparison between Joe Camel and Mickey?

MR. FURR:  As the witness began answering, what he started � he began working up to describing a survey that was done comparing the recognition of Joe Camel and the recognition of �

THE COURT:  I see.  The question doesn't on its face call for hearsay, but the answer that you expect the witness to testify will call for hearsay.

MR. FURR: Yes. I am very confident. He's already said he's going to be giving the results of a survey.

MR. GDANSKI:  He's allowed to rely upon studies and come to conclusions and opinions. I'm not asking to regurgitate the study or the survey or the source or any type of thing.  But an expert is allowed to rely upon information that he typically relies upon.  I didn't ask him

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=695
Page 3572 to cite it.

THE COURT:  But a survey that � inherently has hearsay problems and hearsay statements by people about their opinions, and how is that really probative and how does it get past basic evidentiary requirements?  That's almost like bringing in a lie detector, isn't it?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, not at all.  An expert can rely upon surveys and polling data.  Experts do that all the time.  They'll examine their expert about polling data, so why not this one?

This is an issue about how popular the Joe Camel campaign was.  There were tests done. This expert has come to independent conclusions on that issue, based on reviewing the normal typical things that an expert would otherwise rely upon in this field to reach those conclusions.  That's the standard way in which you use an expert, to discuss conclusions and opinions.  They have to review, assess, look at the outside sources and materials and come to independent conclusions, which he did.  There's nothing wrong with that at all.

MR. FURR:  Here is what the problem is. The survey can be relied upon for certain

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=696
Page 3573 purposes.  And when, in fact, Mr. Gdanski asked

him to describe the popularity of the Joe Camel

campaign, I did not object because he's reached

independent judgment on that based on what he's

reviewed.

Now, there's one survey and one survey only on the issue that he is being asked about, so the only thing �

THE COURT:  That compares to Mickey Mouse?

MR. FURR:  Yes.  There's one survey.  No matter how he coats it, all he's doing is repeating what he read in that poll.  It's pure hearsay.  It's not an opinion.  He's just reciting what he read in the poll unlike the broader question, which I did not object to.

MR. GDANSKI:  He's written about the subject.  He should be allowed to testify about the subject.  It is not hearsay.  I did not ask him � let's examine what hearsay is.  Hearsay is an out-of-court statement, someone else's statement out of court, to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  I did not ask him for any out-of-court statement.  I didn't.  There is no out-of-court statement from some other person that's going to come out of this man's mouth.  I

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=697
Page 3574 asked him what he knows about the subject, what

does his historical review, what does his

scientific review tell him and teach him that he

can share with this jury about this subject.

That is not an out-of-court statement offered to

prove the truth of the matter asserted.  It's

not hearsay.  It doesn't even fall within an

out-of-court statement.

If I took the out-of-court article, the journal, and said what does this journal say about this � but I carefully crafted my questions so as to avoid any of these evidentiary issues.  And the objection is not a valid hearsay objection because it doesn't call for hearsay.

MR. FURR:  May I suggest, Your Honor, that you ask how many surveys were done and if he has any basis for offering his opinions, other than reciting the results of the survey.  I'm very confident the answer is going to be one survey and no, there have been no studies other than this survey that's in effect.  No matter how he coats it, he's just repeating the results of unreliable hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  Just the opposite.  This is a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=698
Page 3575 prime example where an expert can rely upon

hearsay for other opinions, but not be the

conduit for otherwise inadmissible hearsay.

He's not the conduit here for otherwise

inadmissible hearsay.  He is giving appropriate

testimony based on what he's read in the

literature and the scientific material.  This is

an example of an expert relying upon hearsay,

but not at the same time being an inappropriate

conduit.

If I did what Mr. Furr wants me to do, then you turn him into an inappropriate conduit for impermissible hearsay by saying what exactly did this survey say.  And then you would say well, he reviewed it, so now he can rely upon it. That's not what I'm doing.  I didn't hold up the survey or say what does this survey tell you, teach us or explain to the jury.

THE COURT:  He conducted a survey or he read about a survey?

MR. GDANSKI:  There is a survey that's been done in the Journal of Pediatrics.  It's been cited many, many times up to the Surgeon General of the United States.  It's not like one survey that one time appeared.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=699
Page 3576 THE COURT:  He didn't conduct the survey.

He can't tell us anything about the

scientific � how scientific it is �

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not true.  He can.

THE COURT:  � how accurate it is.

MR. GDANSKI:  He can.

THE COURT:  Right now I'm going to sustain

the objection.  There has not been a proper

predicate laid.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll lay a predicate.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr.  Proctor, were studies done �

MR. FURR:  I'm sorry, can I let everybody

get seated.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, were studies done that

analyzed the popularity of Joe Camel compared to

Mickey Mouse?

A    Yes.

Q   Were those studies done and published in

peer-reviewed journals on pediatrics?

A    Yes.

Q    Studies done by individuals who did

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=700
Page 3577 well-recognized, validated, scientifically reliable studies on the subject of how popular Joe Camel was compared to the Disney character for children, Mickey Mouse?

A    Yes, how well known it was. Q    Recognizable? A    Understanding, awareness. Q    Right.

Have you even seen those studies referenced in the Surgeon General reports as recently as the 2012?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  That's hearsay. MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not saying what they say. I'm laying a predicate.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have those studies been referenced thereafter � you talked about citations to studies. Was the study that was done indicating how popular Micky Mouse was or Joe Camel was compared to Mickey Mouse, was that cited thereafter multiple times?

A    Those studies have been cited hundreds of times in the scholarly literature. Q    Right.

Is there any real question when it comes to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=701
Page 357 the conclusion of what you know about the relationship and comparative popularity between Joe Camel and Mickey Mouse as to its accuracy?

A    No question.

Q    Do you know, Dr. Proctor, what the understanding is as to how popular Joe Camel was as compared to Mickey Mouse?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay.

Yes.

I'm asking if he knows

Overruled.

THE WITNESS MR. GDANSKI THE WITNESS BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do you know?

A    Yes, I do.

Q    Would you be able and willing to share it with this jury?

A    I could.

Q    I use the term "popular."  It's recognizable, right?

A    Yes, it's recognizable, yes.

Q    So considering you know it and it's been well validated and studied scientifically how recognizable Joe Camel was as compared to Mickey Mouse, and that you're prepared and willing and able to share it with this jury, can you do that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=702
Page 3579 A    I can.

Q   Will you, please?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  By the early 1990s, studies

were showing that Joe Camel was �

MR. FURR:  Objection, hearsay.  He's saying

what study showed. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Not specifically referencing the study. What do you know about this individual subject?

A    I know that by the early 1990s Joe Camel was as recognizable to six-year-old children as Mickey Mouse was.  In other words, when presented with both images, they were about equal in terms of recognition.  Very young children were able to identify Joe Camel with cigarettes.

Q    The Joe Camel campaign, was it a successful campaign for Reynolds?

A    It was tremendously successful especially for the lower age segment of the cigarette market.

Q Now, just � have you reviewed documents from within Reynolds discussing the origination of the Joe Camel campaign?

A    I have.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=703
Page 3580 Q    Do we know that the Joe Camel campaign came from a French advertising campaign?

A    Originally, yes.

Q    And we know that it was conceived as a campaign that would attract children as young as we can get �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2120, move that into evidence.  PT 2120.

MR. FURR:  Yes, we have objections we have to argue on.

THE COURT:  All right. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Let me preface this.  Mr. Guest is going to address it.  I apologize for taking a moment.  As Mr. Gdanski has a right to, he has designated well over 300 documents.  It just takes me a minute to pull it up and look at it, so I apologize.

THE COURT:  It's all right.

MR. GUEST:  The issue with this is this is a document from 1974, 14 years before the first Camel ad ever appeared.  Based on some kind of French advertisement that they are not going to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=704
Page 3581 show �

THE COURT:  Can you speak up a little bit?

MR. GUEST:  Based on some kind of interpretation of that ad that was ran in France, that they are not going to show this ad � based on what the ad in France did to people in France.  It has nothing to do with what was going on in the United States and it's 14 years before the first �

THE COURT:  I thought I ruled on international stuff.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is not international stuff.  This is a document from R.J. Reynolds, the defendant in this case, talking about their conceding the Joe Camel brand to be used in this country because they saw it used by the manufacturer of Camel overseas.  They said we want to use it here because it is as young as you can get.  It is a statement of a party opponent from Reynolds, the defendant in this case, about Joe Camel cigarettes.

THE COURT:  Do you want to show me the document?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm sure they have it here. It's not a foreign tobacco company document.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=705
Page 3582 MR. GUEST:  That's not what I'm saying.

It's based on foreign activity.

MR. GDANSKI:  But it's about what they're doing in this country.  Your Honor ruled on foreign cigarette warning labels, which has nothing to do with what warning labels were in this country.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let me see it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  So I don't understand your objection.  Because if it's intended to be used in the same market in which Mr. Shulman was in in 1974, why wouldn't I let it in?

MR. GUEST:  That's my point, Your Honor, is that this document deals with activities that occurred outside of the United States in the 1970s.

THE COURT:  It does, right, but it's suggesting, I think, that � their argument, at least, the inference they're going to try to give to the jury, have the jury infer from this document, which the jury is the finder of fact on this case, is that since it was successful in France, they want to use it here.

MR. GUEST:  I think if Dr. Proctor wants to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=706
Page 3583 testify about his review of the record and why

Reynolds did what they did with Camel and Joe

Camel advertising, that's one thing.  But to

show documents that deal with activities in

other countries, that's another thing, and

that's the basis of the objection.  The

activities outside of the United States have no

relevance to the issues of this case, let alone

Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  What's the reference to Camel regular?  Is Camel regular an American product?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, it is.  That's the whole point.

THE COURT:  Overruled. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2120, we move that into evidence.

THE COURT:  Okay.  This will be admitted into evidence over objection. (Exhibit PT2120 was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    February 7, 1974.  Dr. Proctor, this is regarding French Camel filter ad.

Do you see that? A    Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=707

	Page 3584

Q
	It says, I think the French advertisement

for Camel filters is a smash.  It would work equally
	
well, if
	not better, for Camel regular.  It's about

as young
	as you can get.


	Right?

A
	Yes.

Q
	It aims right at the young adult smoker

Camel needs to attract.
	

	Do you see that?

A
	Yes.

Q
	Did R.J. Reynolds � this is from R.J.

Reynolds
	tobacco company?

A
	It is.

Q
	Did they utilize the Joe Camel campaign to

get at people, individuals, children, as young as you
	
can get?
	

A
	That was the plan.

Q
	Were they successful in doing that?

A
	They were.

Q
	Now, this document uses the term "young

adult smoker."
	

	Do you see that?

A
	It does.

Q
	We talked yesterday about the importance of

words.  And do you have documents that actually � we
	
United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=708
Page 3585 referenced it.  We're going to show one now � that referenced the change in the use of words to describe essentially the same �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

MR. GDANSKI:  I am just laying a predicate.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 1481, we move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  This will be admitted into evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT1481 was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    While Mr. Philipson is pulling that up, describe for the jury how you would search for different words if you wanted to drag out the words from the internal documents on the truth database.

A    Well, you plug in an expression, young smoker, young adult smoker, whatever you want, and it will return the documents with that expression.  You can sequence it by time.  You can also measure how often the term is used and how often that word changes over time.  So does the word, does the expression "young adult smoker," is that common or

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=709
Page 3586 uncommon before a certain point.  It allows you to do

a type of linguistic analysis of changing the use of

words over time.

Q   Were you able to do that because the documents are scanned in?

A    They're scanned in, but it's called Optical Character Recognition, where every document is scanned and it allows you to search for any word sequence, even a letter sequence or misspelling or a name, whatever you want, phrase, it will return all documents that use those words.

Q    So here we have from R.A. Pittman � what company is this from?  Who are these people?

A    This is actually a Brown & Williamson document.

Q    1975, January 24.  It says, From time to time when discussing market categories and market audiences, we use references such as young smokers, young market, youth market, et cetera. Right?

A    Yes.

Q    You saw those, and we looked at some documents which showed those terms, right?

A    Yes.

Q   What age brackets, what age categories were

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=710
Page 3587 being described in the documents referring to young smokers or youth market?

A    Typically 14 to 21.  That's the most common characterization.

Q    It says, These terms do not accurately describe what we are talking about.  In the future when describing the low age end of the cigarette business, please use the term "young adult smoker" or "young adult smoking market." Right?

A    Yes.

Q    So describe for me, describe for the jury the context in which why documents like this exist where they're saying let's change a term, but keep the same people.

A    Sometimes it's called wordsmithing.  The idea was that certain expressions could prove embarrassing, if they were discovered.  So there was an effort to make sure that the language appeared safe when used even in internal documents.  So that's why you see the expression "young adult smoker" and not young smoker after this policy was enacted.

Q    Despite the change in the term, you know, you can call it young smoker, you can call it a young adult smoker, you can call it whatever you want,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=711
Page 358� despite the term, was it still the same demographic?

A    It's still the teenage market.

MR. GDANSKI:  And PT 1641, I move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  1641, there's no objection. THE COURT:  Okay.  That will be admitted into evidence without objection.

Sorry about that.  The deputy had to inform me about a transition. (Exhibit PT1641 was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, in examining what we're looking at in the context of the last document, how does this change in term of marketing to the same demographic, how does that help give the industry this form of ability to deny internally what they're truly doing?

A    Internally, in this early period, they're still referring to the young adult market � this is 1974 � as the 14 to 24 age group.  In subsequent documents, they more commonly define the young adult market as 18 and over.  In some of the earlier documents, it's clearer this 14 to 24 age group is who they're talking about when they're talking about

Page 3589 young adults.

Q    Has the industry in the 1970s, the 1980s,

did they publicly deny collectively through their

trade organizations, deny that they marketed to youth

14 to 24 � 14 to 21?

A    Yes.  That was part of the conspiracy, that denial that they were marketing to these teenagers.

Q    And was there ultimately one tobacco company that did acknowledge publicly that historically the industry has marketed to youth?

A Yes, Liggett eventually did do that. They were the first and I think the only company that has admitted marketing to youth.

Q    Have the other companies in the years in which the conspiracy took place, and the years in which cigarette advertising took place, let's say up to and including, you know, the last five to 10 years, the other companies Reynolds, Philip Morris, Lorillard, have they continued to deny publicly that they've ever marketed to youth?

A    I think the better way to put that is they've never admitted that fact.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  We need

to approach, I guess. THE COURT:  Okay.

Page 3590 (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  I move to strike the answer. We've been through this issue at pretrial.  The plaintiffs have the burden of proof.  It's one thing for them to elicit testimony that we've denied something.  We have no duty to admit anything.  Our failure to admit something cannot be the basis for liability in this case.

We had the motion on this.  The Court � this was part and parcel of the motion, of the pretrial motion on order number 19.  If I could show it to Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. FURR:  This was part of the argument that led to that ruling.

THE COURT:  I don't �

MR. GDANSKI:  Can I see what he is � you're showing him?  I don't know what was being referenced.

THE COURT:  My continuation of wrongdoing and all of that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know specifically what was referenced.  I'm not familiar with any pretrial order that says I can't ask them if they've ever admitted they marketed to �

Page 3591 THE COURT:  Nineteen.

MR. GDANSKI:  Nineteen is it?

THE COURT:  It deals with those issues.

MR. GDANSKI:  Failure � supposed failure to � responsibility or apologize to plaintiff. I didn't ask him about taking responsibility to this plaintiff or apologizing to this plaintiff.

THE COURT:  Well, no, but the answers of the witness said that I think � Liggett eventually did that and they were the first and I think actually the only company that admitted marketing to youth.

MR. GDANSKI:  There was no objection to that.  There was no objection to that.

THE COURT:  You just objected �

MR. FURR:  No, it was the next one.

THE COURT:  Maybe a better way to put that is they've never admitted that fact.

MR. FURR:  That's why I move to strike.  He hadn't even responded to the question.  The question was:  Did they continue to deny it? And I would object to the question.

THE COURT:  What I'm going to do is I'm going to say, A, it's nonresponsive.  Let me see what the question was.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=715
Page 3592 MR. GDANSKI:  I think it was responsive.  I

think it's appropriate, but I'll rephrase it.

There's no reason to strike it.

THE COURT:  Well, the question was:  Have they continued to deny publicly that they've ever marketed to youth?  He says, I think the better way to put it is they've never admitted that fact.

They don't have to admit it so �

MR. GDANSKI:  There's not a question of have to or not have to.  It's a question of whether they did.  There is no ruling that says this is out of bounds.

THE COURT:  First of all, it's not responsive to the question.  By him saying I think the better way to put it is nonresponsive, first of all.  Secondly, it appears to not be consistent with the ruling in paragraph 19.

So I'm going to strike the answer.  And make it very clear in the question in what you want him to answer, not what he is trying to answer.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yesterday, when you struck some answers, some of the language you use when you strike the answer, I don't know � I don't

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=716
Page 3593 remember it all by heart, but it's, from my

perspective, a bit severe and punitive, because

you also are telling the jury that this issue

has nothing to do with the case.  I understand

we're striking it for technical legal grounds,

and I'm going to rephrase and get to the same

point, but the sort of austere instruction �

THE COURT:  The purposes of striking the question is so that it's no longer a matter of record.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir, I understand.  But telling them that something has nothing to do with the case when we all know that it does have something to do with the case, you're sort of telling them the subject matter is inappropriate for this case.

THE COURT:  Well, it is with regard to that particular answer, and then you will get another question into evidence, then you will get another question into evidence and that will be in evidence.  They have to remove that from their thought.  And the whole purposes of my striking things is to make it very clear that that is not evidence.  So that the record is very clear.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  I've sustained the last

objection.  So the answer that the witness just

gave, I think the better way to put it is that

they've never admitted that fact, is stricken.

It is not to be considered by the jury.  You're

to remove it from your mind.  It is not evidence

in this case.

Please proceed.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Yes, sir.  Dr. Proctor, without indicating

whether they've ever affirmatively admitted X, Y or

Z, do they continue to deny � when asked, do they

continue to deny that they've ever � Reynolds,

Lorillard and Philip Morris deny that they ever

marketed to youth or children?

Q    Have you seen, Dr. Proctor, the tobacco

industry refer to youth smoking as a crop, right?

A    Yes.

Q    What's the importance of that?  Have you seen the industry in their documents refer to smokers in the youth as a crop, an animal of sorts or a crop?

MR. FURR:  Object.  First of all, that's argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  Second of all, I ask that Mr. Gdanski not use the term "industry" when he's referring only to specific companies. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Have you seen Philip Morris refers to smokers as a crop? A    Yes.

Q    Have you seen Philip Morris refer to smokers as a rats in a cage? A    Yes.

Q    Have you seen the other industry companies refer to smokers as prospects or rookies?

A    Yes, prospects, rookies, novices. Q    Have you also seen the industry

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=719
Page 3596 anthropomorphize themselves?

A    Yes.

Q    What does that mean, when they refer to themselves as living entities?

A    They're treating themselves as humans in a way and their prospects, their commercial market as something less than fully human.

Q    So, Dr. Proctor, we're looking at this document in 1963, which mentions � 1965, sorry � a substantial number of these can be expected to join with this year's crop prospects to produce a healthy increase in the number of new smokers.

Why, Dr. Proctor, were new smokers, young smokers important at the pivotal of this industry?

A    If you don't start smoking as a youth, you don't start smoking at all.  Remember, almost everyone starts in their teenage years.  It's rare for a 25-year-old to start smoking.  That's the crucial market they have to capture to keep the business going.

Q    If there was no youth smoking, there was no youth marketing, no base of the business, the high school student, would we have much less tobacco-related diseases?

Page 3599 MR. FURR:  This is pretty fundamental

evidence, this is Evidence 101.  You can't ask a

witness if things were different, how would they

be different.  That's inherently speculative.

You can't ask the witness if things

were different, then how � there's no basis for

that.  There's no factual basis for it.  It's

requires speculation.

You've sustained this objection three times already.  Mr. Gdanski keeps asking the same question in different forms.  It doesn't make the question any less speculative, just because he rephrases and asks a different way.  He can't possibly have a good-faith basis for believing you won't allow a witness to say that, because it's been sustained three times already.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I have an absolutely good-faith basis and Your Honor overruled �

THE COURT:  It's not like you asked him to recite a statistic or some sort of scientific analysis about this.  That's why I said, you know, you've got to lay a predicate for it.  I don't know what the basis is for him to give this type of opinion.  Why wouldn't it be speculation?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge �

MR. FURR:  � how the past would have been different if it were different.

MR. GDANSKI:  I asked a question, they objected, Your Honor overruled it.  This was the question right here:  Historically, how would the diseases have been without youth smoking? Disease rates is what it was, been without youth smoking.  There was an objection.  It's overruled.

I'll go back and ask that question that Your Honor overruled.  You held it was appropriate.  I tried to get it out of my head again.  Obviously, I must have messed up the language in it again to cause this chaos.  But that is the question I asked:  Historically how would the disease rates have been if it was without youth smoking?  That was a question that was objected to and that was overruled.  That's a perfectly appropriate question.  I just want

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=724
Page 3601 to ask that question.  I'm getting sidetracked

because I tried to rephrase it afterwards.

THE COURT:  What was his answer?

MR. GDANSKI:  He didn't answer it because I came back and rephrased the question and they started objecting again.  He never got to answer the question.

MR. FURR:  He is a historian.  He can tell us about the past.

MR. GDANSKI:  That doesn't change this right here.

MR. FURR:  They're asking to tell us about a past world that doesn't exist.  They are asking to speculate how the world in the past would have been different if things had been different.  It's inherently speculative.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is the question I wanted to ask.

THE COURT:  What was the question?

MR. GDANSKI:  Historically, how would the disease rates have been different without youth marketing?  That's the question I said, and they objected and Your Honor overruled it.  And I'm allowed to ask that question.

THE COURT:  They only objected on

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=725
Page 3602 cumulative.  Are you objecting on different

grounds?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, no, no, they objected before.

THE COURT:  The reason I overruled that one is because they said cumulative only.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not the only objection that was made.

THE COURT:  That was the only objection that was made, was cumulative.  That's why I overruled it, because I didn't think it was cumulative.  When it came up on my screen it said only cumulative.  It never said speculative.  So if you ask it again, they're going to say speculative, and I'm going to sustain the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll lay a predicate of the studies that have been done.  You said he's not seeking � citing studies and information that's out there?

THE COURT:  I don't know what the issues are going to be on that. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, has the scientific community

Q    Have you done that, have you looked at, published independently and researched, the impact on disease rates, death rates as a result of youth marketing?

A    Yes.  I've researched this whole area.

Q    What do you know about that, Dr. Proctor?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Calls for speculation.

MR. GDANSKI: This is not speculative. It's what he's done. It's not speculative, Judge.

Q    No youth marketing, much less disease?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Without youth marketing, would you have the same amount of disease and death?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Speculation. MR. FURR:  Same question, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q The date of this is 1965. It says in the first highlighted section there, The punch. What's the punch?

A The punch of the Surgeon General's report linking cigarettes to cancer, that that was in 1964.

Q    Was by no means as lethal as it first appeared, what is the significance of that?

A    Lethal to the industry.  There's the recognition that truth posed a threat to the industry's ability to do business, and they're commenting that the punch of the truth was not as lethal to our cigarette business as we'd feared.

Q    Then it says, Maxwell has predicted in the

Page 3605 Hutton report that sales in 1965 will approach the 1963 record of 508 billion.

So what's the significance of examining the '65 and the '63 sales?

A    They're looking at how the information coming out into the public was affecting their sales.

Q    I think this is conservative for three reasons.  There's a backlog of youth who have refrained from taking up smoking in the face of the report.  It says, A substantial number of these can be expected to join with this year's crop of prospects to produce a healthy increase. Healthy to who?

A    Healthy to the industry, healthy to the continued sale of cigarettes.

Q    Increase in the number of new smokers. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Did that happen?  Was there, because of the youth marketing from the tobacco companies and the statements made by tobacco companies in public, an increase in youth smoking in this time?

A    Yes.  Smoking continued to increase until 1997.  1997 is the peak year for the prevalence of youth smoking; that is, from the age 12 to 17.

Q    From a historical perspective, Dr. Proctor, in the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s, during the years and periods of time of the conspiracy, did the companies tell the truth about the impact that youth marketing had?

A    No.  They hid the truth.  They didn't want the truth to come out.

Q    There are three groups where smoker percentages and Marlboro shares need to be checked: College students living on campus, young people in the 14 to 17 age group and men in the military service.

Do you see that? A    Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=731
Page 360 Q    Dr. Proctor, how did the tobacco companies use men in the military service to create smoking behaviors in the military?

A    That was a crucial part of their market. The military had long before overrepresented in the smoking population.  There was recognition that this was a vulnerable market, a lot of people under stress, a lot of young people, people who might not be in the best financial situation, and as a result, there was a large effort to capture and maintain the military market.  There was a tremendous amount of success in that.

Q    Were there ever efforts historically to make the military smoke free?

A    Yes.

Q    Tell us about that.

A    In the Reagan period, actually, Caspar Weinberger's 1010 initiative was to create a smoke free military.

Q    What happened?

A    It was effectively suppressed.

Q    By who?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor.

Noerr-Pennington.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is not Noerr-Pennington.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3609 This is the military.

THE COURT:  Can the lawyers approach, please? (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  So I don't know if I have a clean record here, but what it says � what I heard and what it seems to say is that in the Reagan period, actually Caspar Weinberger's 1010 initiative was to create a smoke-free environment.  And was it successful, enormously. And then you object to Noerr-Pennington.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  What I see here doesn't seem like a Noerr-Pennington problem.

MR. GUEST:  The reason is they were saying that the Reagan initiative to try to stop smoking was in the military was suppressed.  The implication is that the tobacco companies did something in the executive branch �

THE COURT:  Does somebody have a better record of this?

MR. GUEST:  � leading to the executive level in the Reagan Administration that prevented it.  It fits clearly into Noerr-Pennington as we talked about yesterday.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=733
Page 3610 THE COURT:  Does somebody have a better

record of this?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think the record is the issue.  I think we can just articulate it. We don't need to look at the transcript for purposes of this issue.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I think the distinction is if I thought the witness was just going to say that the regulations didn't change or whatever � he can certainly testify to what the regulations were, whether smoking was allowed or not allowed.

Where the Noerr-Pennington issue comes up and why I got up when I did, is when he starts to talk about � and Mr. Gdanski will correct me if I'm wrong � is that the tobacco industry tried to prevent the military from going smoke free.

THE COURT:  Is that the 1010 initiative or whatever it's called?

MR. BRENNER:  I don't know what it's called.  That's where the Noerr-Pennington issue is.  They are trying to say that the tobacco companies did something wrong by trying to influence the change or no change in the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=734
Page 3611 regulation.  What the regulation was, I think,

is fair game.  It has marginal relevance, but

that was not my objection.  It was just

factually what the regulations were.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can explain everything except the role that the tobacco companies had. That's unfair.  That's half history.  How can we be prohibited from explaining the full context of the story?  I'm not � by the way, we're not chastising them for it.  We're not asking them to be held liable for it.  But we need to contextualize why smoking persisted in the military.  It wasn't by accident.

THE COURT:  You've repeatedly already gotten in front of the jury, and it's almost getting cumulative now, that it was pushed to the military, it was pushed to the military, that they gave all the soldiers cigarettes, that they pushed it on the soldiers, they pushed it on the soldiers.  That's replete in the record already.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not what this is about.  That was the advertising going to World War II.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not saying in 1990 they pushed smoking on soldiers.

time.  I am not saying that.  That's a totally

separate issue.  One had to do with the

commonality.  The other has to do with

perseverance.

THE COURT: This has to do with an initiative by the White House or by the Secretary of Defense to � who wanted to �

MR. GDANSKI:  Ban smoking in the military.

THE COURT:  � ban smoking in the military.

MR. GDANSKI:  And in the industry �

THE COURT:  First of all, was � during that time period when this happened, Mr. Shulman was not in the military, right?

MR. BRENNER:  Never was.

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course not.

THE COURT: So this goes to, what, reprehensibility?

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to how smoking behavior is shaped in this country.

THE COURT:  What issue in the case? Reprehensibility?  What issue does it go to?  It doesn't go to the liability of Mr. Shulman.

what, reprehensibility?

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to reprehensibility. It goes to levels of awareness.

MR. GUEST:  He said he was not introducing this for purposes of liability �

MR. GDANSKI:  I said levels of awareness as well.

MR. GUEST:  � and now he's saying that it goes to reprehensibility.  That is why we object.

THE COURT:  How does it go to �

MR. GUEST:  How can lobbying the executive branch to not pass the legislation go to reprehensibility?  That's a First Amendment right.

THE COURT:  Let me strike the answer �

MR. GDANSKI:  He didn't answer anything. There's nothing to strike.

THE COURT:  I think he answered it.

MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, but not by who. It could have been suppressed by the Democratic party opposing Caspar Weinberger.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  Judge, I will tell you that nothing � the transcript is not going to help Your Honor figure out what Dr. Proctor said in this instance.  It just is not.  It's not accurate enough.

THE COURT:  I'll just strike the last answer he gave.  That's not referencing �

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think he answered the question.

THE COURT:  That's fine.  I'll just strike it.

MR. BRENNER:  Honestly, he was halfway into his answer.  As soon as he said "they suppressed" is when I stood up.  That's honestly what happened.

THE COURT:  I'll strike whatever his answer was and you can ask another question. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  All right.  I've sustained an objection, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, so the last answer that was given by the witness should be disregarded by the jury.  It is not in evidence and should be put out of your mind. Thank you.

A    All demographics. Q    Specifically which ones? A   Well, they had what was called psychographics, demographics, every race, color, creed, every age group.  It's highly segmented.

Q    Do you know how the former Winston man �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  We're going to have to approach on this, Your Honor. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  I've retrieved the document for Your Honor.  What Mr. Gdanski seeks to elicit from this witness is � I can't even count the levels of hearsay that it involves.  But he's going to ask this witness to tell the jury about an out-of-court statement by a former Winston, a model that was using Winston ads, who purports to state what he claims to have heard an executive for R.J. Reynolds say, although he can't identify that person, he can't be sure who they worked for, he doesn't know anything about it.  But he's going to make a highly inflammatory statement.

The statement is going to be that � this is so improper.  I don't even know where to start with what counsel is trying to do.  He wants this witness to tell the jury that this model overheard an executive say that cigarettes

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=741
Page 361� are marketed for the poor, the black and the

stupid.  The poor, the black and the stupid.

It has nothing to do with this case.  Quite obviously, Mr. Shulman is wealthy.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a historical fact. That's the record.  That's what actually took place.

THE COURT:  That who did what?

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is what it is.  Here is the story.  Dave Goerlitz �

THE COURT:  Who is Dave Goerlitz?

MR. GDANSKI:  I am going to tell you.  Dave Goerlitz was the former Winston man, an employee of R.J. Reynolds.  So he was an employee.

THE COURT:  When you say "Winston man," what do you �

MR. GDANSKI:  He worked with �

MR. FURR:  He was not an employee of �

MR. GDANSKI:  You were very strict about me cutting you off.  Don't do it to me.

Dave Goerlitz was the former Winston man. He was the guy climbing the mountains in the Winston commercials working for R.J. Reynolds. He's on a record � Winston is a Reynolds'

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=742
Page 3619 brand.  It's a statement by a party opponent.

Dave Goerlitz is on record under oath in front

of Congress in congressional testimony.  We have

transcripts.  It's been well vetted up to the

highest levels of Congress.

Dave Goerlitz is on record testifying that the goal of the marketing, based on what he spoke to � another statement of a party opponent, the CEO and an executive � not the CEO, the executive that he named with specificity, at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company said that they market to the poor, the black, and the stupid.

It's not hearsay.  It's a statement by a party opponent.  In these cases sometimes you deal with the subject of reprehensibility, and there are things that are � we believe are reprehensible and they say are not reprehensible, but there are some things that are just truly reprehensible.  And the level of reprehensibility doesn't become the bar to the �

THE COURT:  I don't want argument.  I just need facts right now.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's reprehensible.  The

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=743
Page 3620 facts are that Dave Goerlitz works for Reynolds.

The facts are the executive worked for Reynolds.

THE COURT:  This guy Dave Goerlitz works for?

MR. GDANSKI:  Reynolds.

THE COURT:  Reynolds, you say, for Winston.

MR. GDANSKI:  Exactly.

THE COURT:  There's a transcript where he says something?

MR. GDANSKI:  There's a transcript where he indicates that an executive at Reynolds said �

THE COURT:  An executive at Reynolds?

MR. GDANSKI:  An executive at Reynolds.

THE COURT:  That's hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not hearsay because it's a statement by a party opponent.

THE COURT:  No, no.  He's saying what somebody else said.  The original statement is the one that is not hearsay.  It would be the one that would qualify as a party opponent position.

The problem is you have indirect � in other words, he's saying what he heard somebody else say.  Now, had we had the original person who said it, we had that on the record, then

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=744
Page 3621 that would be a statement by a party opponent.

This doesn't fit the definition of statement by

a party opponent.  So that doesn't meet the

hearsay exception.

MR. GDANSKI:  Both of them worked for Reynolds.  Dave Goerlitz is the Winston man for Reynolds.

THE COURT:  I know that.  But he's not saying he said that.  He's saying that somebody else said that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  But in order to overcome the hearsay exception, there's two independent exceptions for each statement. There is an exception for Dave Goerlitz's statement.  He's an employee of Reynolds. There's an exception for the executive's statement.  He's an employee of Reynolds.  Both statements have independent exceptions.

THE COURT:  No, no.  That's one exception.

MR. GDANSKI:  But it is one exception that applies to both statements.

THE COURT:  It's not the same thing.  Do you have any case law on this?

MR. GDANSKI:  I can get case law that you can have �

Page 3622 THE COURT:  Right now I'll sustain the

objection.  Do not go into it.  Do not reference

it again.  Do not ask another question about it

unless you give me case law.

MR. GDANSKI:  We think the fact that he

testified before Congress about it is valuable. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    When it comes to the marketing shifts, is there something that you refer to as a grand tilt in the marketing of cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    What was that?  Tell the jury about the grand tilt.

A    Prior to the 1960s, you were more likely to smoke if you were highly educated, you were a doctor, even an astronaut.  After the 1960s, the smoking market becomes much more down scale.  You're more likely to smoke if you're poor, less educated.  And I'd refer to that as the grand tilt.

Q    Did the tobacco companies also market based upon race?

A    They did.

Q    Is that just one tobacco company, or did each have departments �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=746
Page 3623 MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was that just one company, or did they all study the different races in this country in an effort to maximize market share?

A    I think they all did.

Q    How about religion?

A    I think they did.

Q    How about sexes, the men and women?

A    Yeah, that goes all the way back a long time.

Q    I guess is there any discrete market that the industry did not study and try to capitalize on?

A    I can't think of one.

Q    Did they look for underdeveloped demographics ?

A    Yes, they did.

Q    Tell us about that.

A    Well, by "underdeveloped," do you mean poor people?

Q    Sure.

A    Yeah.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance. THE COURT:  Overruled.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=747
Page 3624 BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Go ahead.

A    They did.  The grand tilt I was referring to was a recognition that you're much more likely to smoke if you're poor, uneducated, you know, maybe not even finished high school.  That becomes a particularly strong focus in the 1980s and '90s.

MR. GDANSKI:  We move into evidence PT 3405 from Philip Morris.

MR. FURR: May we approach briefly on this one?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  I just wanted to let you guys know that instead of 11B, it's going to be 10B right now, which is actually more convenient for me.  My office is right next to it.  Judge Offtidal had a malpractice case, so we could not switch with him, which is why we were going upstairs.  Offtidal's courtroom is about the same size, bigger, kind of like this one.  So that will work.

MR. BRENNER: Your Honor, this document as a whole is not � I don't have any objection to the entire document.  The problem with the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=748
Page 3625 document is throughout the document there is

discussions of marketing to the African-American

smoking population.  And I assumed when

Mr. Gdanski asked was their marketing based on

race, age, all that is fine because Mr. Shulman

is a race, white, age, and all that.

When you start getting into things, as Mr. Furr pointed out before, Mr. Shulman is not black, he's not poor.  So there's no relevance to marketing to the African-American community. I'm fine with � and I don't know if that's where Mr. Gdanski is going with this.  If he is, I object to the questions and the document.  If he doesn't intend to cover race issues at all on this document, I'm happy to let the document go in subject to the redactions we can make to the Court later.

MR. GUEST:  This is very transparent. Mr. Gdanski wants to insert race into his case, not because it has anything to do with the plaintiff, who we'll recognize as an elderly white gentleman, he wants to insert race with the hopes of inflaming the diverse jury that we have before us that has at least two members who appear to be African-American descent.  And

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=749
Page 3626 that's why he wants to do it.

It's inflammatory.  It's prejudicial.  It's 403.  It's got nothing to do with any issues in the case.  Racial targeting certainly has nothing to do with concealment or conspiracy to conceal, which are the only torts that can support reprehensibility.  So this is clearly being done for one reason and one reason only and that's why I object.

MR. GDANSKI:  That is absolutely false.  I reject that premise.  It's not true.  These are their internal documents.  We've done nothing with anything to do with these jury or different questions based on the jury demographics.  That is an unfair accusation that is absolutely baseless, that's number one.

Number two, this is their internal document.  I'm not fabricating some kind of evidence or creating some kind of history to match the demographic.  This is a statement of a party opponent.  It's obviously relevant.

THE COURT:  It may be a statement of a party opponent, but the question is what relevance does it have to the case?

MR. GDANSKI:  Marketing as a whole is

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=750
Page 3627 relevant.  Marketing � the scope of marketing

is relevant.  Judge, the point is they would

like to make it seem �

THE COURT:  They weren't marketing to the same market that Mr. Shulman was in, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  That doesn't matter.  The whole point is smoking is a cultural phenomena. It was created because of advanced pervasive marketing.

THE COURT:  You've said that over and over again.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's different decades. Smoking doesn't exist at a moment in time with one question.  It's something that occurred over 50, 60, 70, 80 years.  There's hundreds of thousands of documents that say this.  I picked 10.

THE COURT:  What does it say in the document?

MR. FURR:  While he identifies those examples, Your Honor, we did not hear any theory of relevance articulated.  To the extent � it is cumulative with respect to the fact that, yes, we've marketed and it may have affected the smoking patterns.  He's said that over and over.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=751
Page 362� It is cumulative.

These are inflammatory documents that � the language used in these documents is insensitive.  It's from a different time era than we're in right now.  It's not the way anybody would speak today.  It's highly inflammatory.  Even if there was a theory of relevance, which I submit there is not, it's more prejudicial than it is probative.

MR. GDANSKI:  It can't be that they do such heinous things and then say those such heinous things are so prejudicial that they can no longer be probative.  That's unfairly prejudicial to the plaintiff.  It gives essentially, the defendant permission to act so inappropriately, and then thereafter claim, hey, we get what we did was really, really inappropriate, and now it's so inappropriate, that it outweighs the prejudicial.  They can't get the benefit, from the evidentiary perspective, from the super heinous nature of their actions.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, if you start at the bottom of that page, it goes on for about five pages talking about racial disparities and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=752
Page 3629 racial marketing.  You can see the flags.  This

document is replete with it.

I guess I'm not understanding Mr. Gdanski's argument.  He's not answered the question yet, at least which I've heard, which is how in the world is marketing to African Americans relevant to Mr. Shulman's case.  He has already established with the witness that marketing was widespread.  They marketed to all different groups, which you would expect.  They wanted to sell a lot of cigarettes.  They did sell a lot of cigarettes.  There's no basis to go into specific issues regarding racial issues other than to � I haven't heard a different explanation other than the one Mr. Furr suggested.

MR. GDANSKI:  I reject it again.  I made the record each time and made accusations that we're tailoring their conduct to match this jury.  I absolutely reject that.  It's 100 percent false.

Judge, so you understand, cigarettes were marketed by these companies as being safe, not dangerous, not harmful to health to all different demographics.  That's reprehensible to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=753
Page 3630 do that, when you know internally, as we're

going to lay out if we ever get to it, the fact

that they knew internally full well it was

dangerous.  It's reprehensible.

THE COURT: I think, A, it's � it appears to be irrelevant. It also appears to be cumulative of what's been talked about already. We've already gotten him to say marketing was based on racial factors. You've already gotten a whole bunch of things about marketing in. So it's getting cumulative.

Thirdly, just weighing this, taking a look at this and weighing the possible relevance of it, which appears to be either none or minimal, compared to the prejudicial effect of it, I'm weighing it and I'm making a determination as to how prejudicial it could be to the jury, to the defendants with regard to the jury, and I'm not going to allow it in.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to use the portions of it that don't deal with race.  Okay?

THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  Let's get started.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 3631 (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  So we're going to move this into evidence, PT 3405.

MR. BRENNER:  No objections, subject to the discussions at the bench.

THE COURT:  So it will be admitted subject to those objections. (Exhibit PT3405 was admitted into evidence.) MR. BRENNER:  Redacted. THE COURT:  Redacted, yes, thank you. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, did Philip Morris know that teenagers were tomorrow's potential regular customers?

A    Yes.  That's an actual quote from one of the documents.

Q    Okay.  And in light of that, did they continue to make sure they attracted as many teenagers as possible? A    They did.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 12 65, we move that into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  Give me a second, please. MR. GDANSKI:  It's William Estee. MR. FURR:  No objection.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=755
Page 3632 MR. GDANSKI:  And also PT 3318.

THE COURT:  That one will be admitted into

evidence without objection, the first one.

Now we're waiting on the second.

(Exhibit PT3318 was admitted into evidence.)

MR. FURR:  No objection to the second one,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  So that is also

admitted into evidence without objection.

(Exhibit PT1265 was admitted into evidence.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    On 3318, Rob, can you go to page 3, please?

Thank you.

I have a question for you, Dr. Proctor.  It

talks here about on the fifth line, that Marlboro was

simply available.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you discuss historically the

significance of the fact that for many years

cigarettes have just simply been available?

A    It's a key concept in the whole epidemic.

Because if cigarette � if everyone is using

cigarettes, it just becomes the thing to do.  That's

why vending machines were so important.  If you could

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=756
Page 3633 just buy cigarettes at a vending machine, at a

supermarket, or a gas station at 2 in the morning, it

made it very convenient.  It made it hard to do age

checks, things like that.  So just the availability,

the imagery, the practice, it made it acceptable and

normal.  We call it a normalization.

Q    And how did that normalization, how did it

relate to tobacco industry efforts?

A    They made an effort to make sure that

cigarettes were available.  Every gas station, every

supermarket, pharmacies.  You know, ashtrays being

everywhere.  There was just the sense that it was

very easy and convenient to smoke.

Q    Are there examples, Dr. Proctor, in the

historical record of the industry communicating with

schools?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'd move into evidence three

examples of that, 1252, 1577 and 1433A.

MR. FURR:  We have objections to those.

We'll need to approach.

MR. GDANSKI:  These have already been ruled

on, as far as I'm aware.

THE COURT:  What's that?

MR. GDANSKI:  I thought those were already

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=757
Page 3634 ruled on.

MR. FURR:  You just offered them into evidence.  How could they be ruled on?

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  Let's go. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  We're retrieving those documents, Your Honor.  I don't understand why Mr. Gdanski would say � turn to me and say I thought those had already been ruled on when he just offered them in evidence.

MR. GDANSKI:  Because in Dr. Figlar's deposition, these school letters, one of them � and it's the same issue for all three of them � one of these letters came up, they raised this objection then, and Your Honor overruled it.  So I have every good-faith basis to believe that if it would come in from Dr. Figlar's deposition, it would come in here.

MR. FURR:  But the other two haven't been ruled on.

MR. GDANSKI:  They're the same exact premise, just from different decades.  So it's one from each decade and there's thousands from each decade.  We picked three from thousands.  I have every good-faith reason to believe that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=758
Page 3635 Your Honor would be consistent with what you

told the defense last Friday.

MR. GUEST:  Your Honor, during our discussion of Dr. Figlar's deposition, 1577, was overruled, and we believe the same ruling should be made here.

Similarly, because 1252 is a similar document in a similar time frame, while Mr. Shulman was still smoking, even though it has to do with a letter to a fourth grade class in Washington state, based on Your Honor's ruling of 1577, I assume Your Honor would still apply the same ruling here.

But based on document 1433A �

THE COURT:  So my ruling will be the same as to those other two.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is the same exact thing.

THE COURT:  It will go in over objection. This is something different?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's the same thing, just from a different decade.  This is from 1990. This is still within the context of the conspiracy.  They're still conspiring.  There's no question about that.

The whole point is to show that this theme

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=759
Page 3636 of the school letters to the schools didn't

exist in a vacuum.  It existed in multiple

decades.

Again, I'm picking three.  There are thousands, tens of thousands, actually, that we have to use.  And I'm not going to introduce and go through tens of thousands.  I just want to make the point with three.

MR. GUEST:  I don't know about Mr. Gdanski's representation that there are tens of thousands of these.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thousands for sure.

MR. GUEST:  The point of this letter is, number one, it happened in 1990.

Number two, it happened in upstate New York.

Number three, it that has nothing to do with the issues in this case.

Number four, it's cumulative of the evidence that has already been submitted.

And number five, this is actually a letter that was prompted by another one of the plaintiff's experts in this litigation in order to elicit some sort of response like this.

But the sixth point, Your Honor, is that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=760
Page 3637 this is not the same type of response that the

other two letters involved.  It certainly has no

relevance to the issues in this case.

Given the cumulative nature of the evidence introduced thus far, this letter from 1990, that is clearly outside the time period that Mr. Shulman was smoking, and not relevant to any issue in the case, you should sustain the objection to this particular document.

MR. GDANSKI:  That is not true.  None of those are evidentiary bases just to keep the document out of evidence.

First of all, there will be testimony he was smoking during that period of time.

Number two, it shows the consistent nature of how they interacted with schools.  That's the whole point.  They want to take things that happened over the course of time and just limit it to a nice small period of time.  That's not what the conspiracy was.

THE COURT:  Overruled. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Breaking at 11:45, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yeah, maybe we'll break a little before 11:45 because I need some time

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=761
Page 363� with you guys to go over the logistics for the

move for Monday.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we're going to end up � on Monday, we're not going to be in 9F.  We're actually going to be in 10B, which is the courtroom right next to my smaller courtroom.  It should be pretty close to the same size as this one.  But this is a criminal courtroom and the head of criminal wants this courtroom back.  We thought we were going to be able to stay here, but it looks like we're going to have to move to 10B.

There's some logistics.  We're going to have to take a longer lunch because there is going to have to be some moving stuff so that on Monday we'll be ready to go there.  We will continue here this afternoon.  There's some logistics about moving to 10B starting on Monday.  All right.

You may proceed.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you, sir.

THE COURT:  Maybe a couple minutes before. Maybe around � go for about 10 minutes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Understood, yes, sir.  Thank you.

Q    Okay.  Dr. Proctor, school letters, tell us before we show them, I think they're in evidence, 1252, 1577 and 1433A, tell the jury, please, how it was that tobacco companies are communicating with schools and principals of school children.

A    Well, preserved in the archives are nearly 100,000 letters from ordinary consumers, ordinary Americans to the companies, and then the companies would write back.  We most have letters from Reynolds.  But in the ordinary course of business, you would expect consumers to write to a company and they would write back.  Many of these are about health questions.  And that's what we have a record of.

Q    Let's take a look at one from 1963 from a fourth grade classroom, 22, in Tacoma, Washington. Dr. Proctor, does it make a difference � we've selected three.  How many of these school letters are there?

A    School letters is a much smaller sample of this.  The consumer letters are nearly 100,000, but there's probably a few dozen I haven't counted.

Q    You've heard the term "Baby Boomers"?  What generation, what time period is that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=763
Page 3640 A    That's the people born after World War II.

Q    So does it make a difference � this is

from Tacoma, Washington, does it make a difference if

we pick one from Tacoma, Washington, or Washington,

D.C. or Fort Lauderdale, Florida?

A    No.  They're similar.  The responses are similar because they're formulaic.  They have teams of people writing these letters back to the school children.

Q    Are Baby Boomers anybody born after World War II?

A    No.  They're people typically born in the late '40s and the '50s and into the early '60s.

Q    Understood.  So this is the fourth graders, and this is Reynolds' response, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Dear students, thank you for thinking of us in connection with your school research project. Was it common, Dr. Proctor, for school projects to involve making ashtrays back in the '50s, '60s and '70s?

A    Yes, the Pentagontic guides actually included guides for teachers to have students in high school make an ashtray for their parents.  You'll find that as late as the 1970s.  It's not uncommon

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=764
Page 3641 for children to make ashtrays.

Q   As you know, opinions regarding smoking are by no means uniform.  Our feeling has always been that smoking is a past-time for adults and that young people should not smoke.

Just to orient us in time, this is 1963. This is 20 years before Joe Camel?

A    Yes.

Q   And 20 years � 21 years before replacement smokers?

A    Yes.

Q    This is two years before the document that said young people will be a crop?

A    That's right.

Q   Despite many years of extensive research, medical science has been unable to establish that smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease.  We are firmly of the opinion, however, that definite answers to the many unanswered smoking and health questions and the true causes of human disease can be determined only by scientific research.  Our company intends, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth is known. Do you see that, Dr. Proctor?

A    I see that.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=765
Page 3642

Q    Was this a consistent theme in school letters?

A    It is.  The industry would write we are taking responsibility, trying to find out the truth.

Q    We'11 go through two more and I'11 have some questions.  Let's take a look at the next one, 1577.  This is to a Will Rogers Elementary School in Santa Monica, California.

Fifth graders, right?

A    Yes.  This is another consumer letter. This one is by Ted Cahill from the public relations department.  They had a whole team of people writing these letters.

Q    It says, Despite all of the research going on, medical science has not found any conclusive evidence that an element in tobacco or tobacco smoke causes any human disease.

What year is this?  1972?

A    Yes.

Q    So this is fifth graders.  That's about 10 year olds, 11 year olds?

A    Sounds right.

Q    This is after the Surgeon General's report, right?

A    It is.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=766
Page 3643 Q    This is after there's cautionary warning

statements on cigarettes, right?

A    Yes.

Q    It says, Medical science has not found any conclusive evidence that an element in tobacco or tobacco smoke causes any human disease. Is that true, Doctor?

A    It was false.

Q    The answers to the many unanswered smoking and health questions and the true causes of human disease can, we believe, be determined by scientific research.  Our company intends, therefore, to continue to support such researching until the truth is known.

Same idea, continuing to support research until the truth is known?

A    Right.  Additional idea that we're being open-minded, we don't want to close our minds.  We need to keep researching ideally forever.  Research as delays.

Q    Did this theme continue until the 1990s and thereafter?

A    It did.

Q    All right.  Let's take a look at the third one, 1433.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=767
Page 3644 This is January 11, 1990, to the principal at the Willowridge School in Amhurst, New York, right?

A    Yes.  Again, this is a letter from Reynolds to the principal of a school.

Q    In these documents, in these letters, would they oftentimes include enclosures?

A    Yes, they would include Tobacco Institute brochures, for example.

Q    It says, A number of your fifth grade students have written R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company commenting that they do not feel our company should allow the use of our brand's name on children's toys and cigarettes.

On the bottom it says, Despite all of the research going on � so this is now 1990, correct?

MR. FURR:  Rule of completeness, could you

read the second paragraph, please. MR. GDANSKI:  I'll read it. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    As information, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's policy is not to allow our brand names to be used on toy or candy cigarettes, and any current use of our brand name in this fashion is not sanctioned by our company.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=768
Page 3645 Can you tell us what's going on there?

A    Well, there were a number of candy companies making candy cigarettes using the Reynolds name, Winston candy cigarettes, Salem candy cigarettes, Camel candy cigarettes.  And this was tolerated for decades, until finally in the '80s and '90s there started to be some protests against that. But for decades there were examples where the tobacco companies would actually provide their artwork to the candy companies so that the candy cigarettes would look identical.  From the packaging point of view, they would look identical to the real cigarettes.

Q    And was that tolerated and even promoted by the tobacco industry, the use of Camel imagery or Lucky Strike imagery on the cigarettes?

A    Yes.  By the separate companies it was actually encouraged according to the philosophy, as we have in one document it's not too bad of advertisement for our products and also creating cigarettes in the mind of future smokers.

Q    Candy cigarettes, obviously those are for children.  Candy, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Despite, in 1990, all of the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact is that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=769
Page 3646 scientists do not know the cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    In 1990, 26 years after the Surgeon General's report, after the warning � in 1995, there were rotating warnings put on cigarette packs.

A    Yes.

Q    The same ones we have today.  They haven't changed even a little bit, right?

A    Haven't changed in 30 years.

Q    Despite all of that, Reynolds was telling people, hey, we have no idea what causes cancer. MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and

argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Despite the years and the research, the Surgeon General and all of the information they say smokers have, what was Reynolds telling school children?

A    That it was not known whether cigarettes really caused disease.  There was no evidence and we needed more research.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=770
Page 3647 Q    Then they tell the principal, on the next page, We would appreciate your passing this information along to your students.  You may also be interested in the enclosed publications � you may also be interested in the enclosed publications presenting the position of our company and the tobacco industry on the issue of youth smoking. So do you see that, Dr. Proctor? A    Yes. Q    It's signed by Jo F. Spach.

Do you know who she is? A    I know she is part of the public relations department, that team of PR people I was mentioning.

Q    What's the importance, Dr. Proctor, of this multigenerational campaign to mislead school children?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What's historically significant about the letters we've looked at here?

A    It's kind of a microscopic example of a one-to-one communication where the same fraud is being perpetuated.  It's a war on the truth.

MR. GDANSKI:  The next thing is going to be

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=771
Page 364c" a relatively lengthy video, Judge.

THE COURT:  So this is a good breaking point then?

MR. GDANSKI:  As good as any, yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please don't communicate during the lunch break with each other about the case.  Same thing with anybody else.  Don't use any electronic devices on the case.  Don't make any � post any comments on any social web sites.  Don't do any independent research of your own or any independent investigation, whether electronic or otherwise.

Again, I apologize, but because of the logistics of what we need to do, we're going to start again at about 2:00.  So report maybe five to 2:00 and the deputy will tell you where to meet.  We'll see you back at that time, thank you very much. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  The witness may step down.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir. (Thereupon, the witness exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  All right.  So what I want you guys to do is � I don't know whether you want

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=772
Page 3649 to have lunch first or afterwards, but I want

you to communicate with the deputy as soon as I

guess she comes back in, as soon as she gets the

jury off to the elevator, and make sure that

they're opening up the doors so we can figure

out what rooms you guys will move your stuff to

upstairs.  On the tenth floor now, instead of

the 11th floor.  So it will be 10B, which is

Judge Offital's courtroom.

If there's a problem, you can't get through to the deputy and you're having problems getting through, my judicial assistant, Andrea Morris, get ahold of her, in the event that there's a problem because I'11 be at a committee meeting at the same time.  But the deputies should be able to facilitate that.

I'd like you guys to move as much as you possibly can that you don't really need over here and get situated.  Whether it's inside part of the courtroom or whether it's in part of the conference room that they'll try to make available for you.

I understand Deputy Fox is gone for the day but this deputy is filling in and he's already filled her in on what's going to happen.  The

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=773
Page 3650 only thing I want to make sure she knows is it's

no longer 11B but it's 10B.

So the electronics will stay here?

MR. GDANSKI:  We're going to be here in the afternoon.

THE COURT:  Because you said you can't be here during lunch break.

MR. PHILIPSON:  I told my guys to be here at 3:30 to break down.  And when they stop, we'll wait outside and we'll break it all down.

THE COURT:  All right.  So that will be done later because we'11 just stay here in terms of the electronics.  Everything else that you can move, can move there.

And then camera people that are doing the web thing, for you, you just move all of that stuff tonight as well, right?

A/V TECHNICAL PERSON:  That's correct.

THE COURT:  Anything else we need to do logistically?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, sir.

MR. FURR:  No, sir.

MR. BRENNER:  No, sir.

THE COURT:  So you're to report back here. We'll try to start as close to 2:00 as we can.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=774
Page 3651 MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  She

says 2199, you're looking for that exhibit?

Does somebody have 2199 for her?

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll hand it to her.

THE COURT:  Okay.

PROCEEDINGS

(Continued from Volume 2 6.)

THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court is in session.  The Honorable Judge Artau presiding.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Have a seat.

I heard we were able to move the boxes, but the courtroom was being used by somebody, but it's not going to be used on Monday. And then I guess we'll see what happens at the end of the day, whether that hearing is � that courtroom is available or not. If not, are the IT people able to move things on Saturday?

(Witness takes the stand.)

THE COURT:  No?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think so.  I don't really know.  I'm not � I don't think so.

MR. PHILIPSON:  We'll try to.

THE COURT:  Because we could make the building open on Saturday for that purpose.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's certainly not something that we had planned on doing.

THE COURT:  I wasn't planning on moving there � anybody either.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  So the

THE COURT:  No.

MR. PHILIPSON:  Okay.  So we're definitely not moving again?

I didn't think we were going to have to move from here.

All right.  Well, we'll see whether Dina's trial gets over.  We'll get word if the trial ends early enough where we can have access to that courtroom tonight, but it will finish today.  It won't be going on on Monday.

THE BAILIFF:  Right, she's going to move back to her own courtroom on Monday.

THE COURT:  Well, I think they should come today.  If they can't come on Saturday and need to come today, and then as soon as � I just don't know if there's going to be � is the jury going to be deliberating today, or is she going to be in the middle of the trial?

THE BAILIFF:  No, they're not going to be done today.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So if they're not going to be done today, there's not going to be any late-night deliberating, which means Dina � Dina probably would not go � or Judge Keever probably would not go until past 5:00.  You know, if she had a witness on the stand, she might go to 5:30.

It's very unlikely that she's going to go beyond 5:00.  So we may not even be able to get in there right at 4:30, but we'll be able to get in there at 5:00 or 5:30.  So we should be fine. So just remain as planned.

All right.

on the drawing you have to your right, and you

have the Tobacco Institute there as one of the

eras of the conspiracy, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So did the Tobacco Institute have individuals who would go on TV and talk for the entire industry?

A.  They did.

Q.  Can you just describe that process, how that worked?

A.  This was mainly in the 1970s.  There are some examples later as well where what was called The Truth Squad would go around and do interviews on television, radio, all around the country.  And hundreds of hours were done per year on this method.

Q.  And do you know who Anne Browder was?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And who was Anne Browder?

A.  She was a spokesperson for the tobacco industry who very often appeared on television defending the cigarette industry's programs.

Q.  Okay.  And as part of the Tobacco Institute, there was the Traveling Truth Squad?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was the Traveling Truth Squad?

A.  As I mentioned, they would go around and they would appear on TV stations, radio stations, often interviews with opposing parties and say: There's no proof that cigarettes cause harm.

Q.  Okay.  Was there also something called the College of Tobacco Knowledge?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was that?

A.  That was a type of training program to train spokespersons for the industry who would follow the routine of saying:  We need more research.  There's no evidence it causes harm, that sort of thing.

Q.  So Anne Browder, you're familiar with interviews that Ms. Browder gave on the show 20/20 for the tobacco industry?

A.  Yes.

Q.  This is 1983?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And it's ABC News 20/20.  It was a popular show at the time?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And do you know who was interviewing

VOICE:  On the ABC News Magazine, 20/20, tonight kids under 21, America's youngsters, are they the new target for cigarette manufacturers?

Spokesmen for the industry say no, but cigarette advertising is everywhere, sporting events, rock and jazz concerts, billboards, magazines, and giveaways.

VOICE:  For almost 30 years, the research and the warnings on the many harmful effects of cigarette smoking have multiplied.

But where in 1954 the number of

Page 3665 cigarettes sold was 387 billion, this year's

estimate is 617 billion.

Now one fact that may help clarify this odd progression of events is that more money is spent for promoting cigarettes than for any other product, and some of this promotion seems aimed at children.

VOICE:  Smoke anywhere and you'll enjoy the cigarette of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike.

VOICE:  It was 12 years ago that cigarettes were banned from radio and TV.

VOICE:  Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch.

VOICE:  I've forgotten what these ads are like.  It's amazing to watch them now.

VOICE:  Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should.

VOICE:  The growing evidence that these products were killing people eventually led to their ban from broadcasting, but tobacco companies, however, still claim the health hazards haven't been proven.

We asked Phillip Morris, RJ Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and Lorillard to appear on this program.  None would.  They told us to talk

Browder would speak for them.

VOICE:  The case is still open.  The jury has not come in.

VOICE:  It may not be harmful; you're not convinced?

VOICE:  It may be, or it may not be; we don't know.

VOICE:  How can you say it might not be harmful, yet most of the people who die of lung cancer smoke?  I mean, how can there not be a connection?

VOICE:  We certainly are aware of the fact that people die on a daily basis.  Some of them are smokers and some of them are not smokers.

VOICE:  Call for Philip Morris.

VOICE:  Even though they say they're not convinced that cigarettes kill, tobacco companies say they voluntarily canceled their radio and TV ads before Congress banned them.

VOICE:  We feel very strongly that cigarette smoking isn't about custom, that one should not even consider until they've reached the age of maturity.

VOICE:  Anyone over the age of 21.

VOICE:  But studies show that 80 percent of all smokers started before they were 21.

VOICE:  The cigarette manufacturers are not interested in obtaining new business from teenagers in our society.

VOICE:  But how can you stay in business if you can't hook the kids?

VOICE:  We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting to hook kids.  We do everything possible to discourage teenage smoking.

VOICE:  Do they?

VOICE:  Recently tobacco companies have found new ways to display their products where kids can be impressed.  Can't advertise on television?  Sponsor a tennis tournament that's covered on television.

VOICE:  Out.

VOICE:  In many baseball stadiums, when someone hits a home run, some brand of cigarette gets on TV.  Games like this one have about 40,000 viewers under 21.

VOICE:  You just said you don't want to expose kids to smoking.

VOICE:  If the purpose of it isn't to sell cigarettes, why do they sponsor it?  Out of the goodness of their heart?

VOICE:  I would imagine that's part of the reason why they sponsor it, because they've been approached by various people for sponsorship, and they take the accord to do that.

Tobacco companies have been doing a lot of this

lately.  Their code says:  We shall not give

cigarettes away at any public place within two

blocks of any center of youth activity.

But here they're passing them out in front of a David Bowie concert.  Lots of kids here .

Cigarettes were also passed out at concerts given by the Talking Heads and The Animals.

VOICE: You pass out free cigarettes at these concerts. I don't see you passing out free cigarettes at Frank Sinatra concerts.

VOICE:  There are many, many adults at those concerts.

VOICE:  The owners of the concerts say 40 to 60 percent of the audience is under 21.

The tobacco code also says: Don't give cigarettes to anyone under 21.

Well, we asked a 16-year-old to try to get some.

VOICE:  Regular or mild?

VOICE:  Regular.

VOICE:  Reynolds Tobacco says they fire people who violate the sampling code.

We tried to ask the samplers about all this, but they said they've been told not to talk to the media.

VOICE:  This videotape made last winter by the Chicago Lung Association shows young people being given Bright cigarettes.  Sixteen-year-old Joe was given a pack.  So was Paulette.  She's 18. And Chris, he's 19.

Seven of nine young people who asked for cigarettes got them.

VOICE:  When the Chicago Lung Association sent people out, kids got them.

VOICE:  I cannot address that.  I can tell you what the sampling code is for cigarette manufacturers, and the sampling companies are sworn to adhere by that code.

Page 3672 cigarettes.  This summer Brown & Williamson began

running ads for Kool and Barclay at some 3,000

movie theatres.  They wouldn't give us copies, so

we filmed them off the movie screen.

The Kool ad was shown at this theatre in Newton, Massachusetts, right before a performance of Snow White.  Brown & Williamson says that was a mistake.  It should only run before "R" and "PG" films.

Of course, "PG" means the cigarette ad could run with kids' pictures like Star Wars and Superman.

Even if movie advertising were banned, there would still be cigarettes in movies popular with kids.

These pictures are from Superman II. Marlboro, made by Philip Morris, is shown at least 13 times.

I asked the Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were shown so often in Superman II.

moviemaker just showed Marlboro on his own?

VOICE:  Perhaps the moviemaker was a Marlboro smoker.

VOICE:  We tried to ask the moviemaker, but he wouldn't talk to us.  Philip Morris wouldn't comment on the financial arrangement except to say they didn't pay their producers cash.

Maybe, of course, it doesn't matter. Kids see the billboards all the time.  Tobacco companies spend so much money on advertising that nearly every other billboard in America promotes cigarettes.

VOICE:  I think the cigarette manufacturers have the right to advertise their product.  I think they have the right to sponsor a variety of events as they do.  I don't think it's illegal.  So why not?

Q.  And can you just give the jury a flavor

for that, please?

A.  Well, they were small packs, typically two cigarettes per pack, or four.  These were given out in samples all over the country, millions every year, and that went on for decades.

Q.  Sports stadiums, did they advertise at sports stadiums?

A.  They did.

Q.  One of the things that was referenced in that clip was Superman, Part I and the film Superman II.  Do you remember that?

Reeves breaks out of a giant billboard, we know

exactly how much was paid for that.

Q.  And do we have that contract that we can

share with the jury?

A.  Yes, we have parts of it.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT1598, 1598, move that

into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  One second, please.

No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  It will be

admitted into evidence without objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So let's take a look.

smoking and they say:  Nothing has harmed you yet?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  So were there films where smoking may be portrayed as something that could be harmful?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that happened in Superman, Part I?

A.  It did.

Q.  So how did the industry respond by making sure Superman, Part I, had as much Marlboro as possible?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How did they respond?

THE COURT:  I guess you withdrew it and re-asked it, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  What was that? THE COURT:  You reasked the guestion? Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  I'll reask it.

After Superman, Part I, had a scene showing an x-ray of a chest, what did the industry do to ensure their message was in Superman, Part II?

Q.  And this is a letterhead on Dovemead Limited, Pinewood Studios, and it's from Philip Morris Europe SA, in Switzerland, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  But it's for the Marlboro brand for a movie in this country, Superman II, right?

A.  It is.

Q. Okay. It says: This letter confirms the agreement that has been reached between our two companies whereby we have agreed to include in our feature film, currently entitled "Superman II," (The Film) exposure of the Marlboro brand name (The Material) on the following terms and conditions.

Let's go down one second. We shall have absolute discretion as to the final content of the film and all artistic and technical decisions over all aspects of production and post-production of the film.

So the date of this � it's hard to see at the top right now � is 1979, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The clip � the clip that we looked at from Anne Browder, that's 1983?

Q.  So was there any question as to the truth of how Marlboro cigarettes made their way int o Supe rman II?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Ms. Browder was speaking for Marlboro, speaking for Philip Morris, right ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did Philip Morris know, obviously, how their product got into the Superman II movie?

A.  They put it into the movie, so of course they knew.

Q.  Okay.  And is this the only movie that product placement was paid for by the tobacco company, any one of them?

A.  No, there are many examples.

Q.  You're familiar with the film Grease?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And does the film Grease have important references to cigarettes and portrayals of cigarette smoking?

A.  It does.  The cigarette is used as a vehicle for coming of age, where Olivia Newton

A.  No.

Q.  How have the cigarette companies, the manufacturers, made themselves invisible?

A.  Well, that's part of what's called the third-party strategy.  It's the use of other venues to get cigarettes commonly used without revealing that it's actually the industry responsible for that use.

It happens a lot in science because they paid a lot of scientists to say that cigarettes don't cause cancer without revealing that they were actually paying the scientists to do that.

And it would look like, on a scientist, was disputing that it caused harm when, in fact, they're being paid as shields for the industry.

Q.  So why is that important?  Why is the fact that you're getting a message and you don't know that it's coming in an underlying form from the industry, why is that important?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Why is the third-party strategy important, the invisibility of the industry important?

authority figure, then it would look like there

cigarettes caused harm, and that was the

A.  Well, again, this is the third-party strategy.  The industry was no longer allowed to advertise on television after 1971, but they could create films that would be shown over and over again, and these would act as immortal cigarette ads .

And in the early 1980s, Sylvester Stallone, at the height of his career, was � signed a contract with Brown & Williamson for $500, 000 to smoke Brown & Williamson brands in five of the � his future feature films.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT1505, we have that, and we move that into evidence, please. MR. FURR:  No objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Let's take a look. How did these movies, whether it's Grease, that children still watch today, or any of these movies, how do they live as eternal cigarette advertisements?

A.  Well, they're forever there.  I mean, if someone is watching Superman II a thousand years from now, they'll see all this product placement.

A.  We must get our share of the youth market.

Q.  In my opinion, this will require new brands tailored to the youth market.  It goes on to say:  Thus, we need new brands designed to be particularly attractive to the young smoker, while ideally, at the same time, being appealing to all smokers.

Did they do that?

A.  They did.

And then the second stage, once you're already addicted and you no longer smoke to look cool.  You smoke for pharmacological reasons

Q.  For the pre-smoker and "learner," the

physical effects of smoking are largely unknown,

unneeded, or actually quite unpleasant or awkward.

The expected or derived psychological

effects are largely responsible for influencing

the pre-smoker to try smoking and provide

sufficient motivation during the "learning" period

to keep the "learner" going, despite the physical

unpleasantness and awkwardness of the period.

So that's before you start smoking, it

might be uncomfortable; it might be irritating,

right ?

MR. FURR:  Leading.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What's going on here?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What's it describing?

A.  It's the first stage.  In other words,

you're smoking to look cool, to look older.  And

the experience is unpleasant at first, you know,

nausea, things like that.

Q.  It says:  In contrast, once the

"learning" period is over, the physical effects

become of overriding importance and desirability

Is he describing the addictive process?

A.  Yes, the first stage is psychological. The second stage is pharmacological.

Q.  ...to the confirmed smoker.  And the psychological effects, except the tension-relieving effect, largely wane in importance or disappear. Right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now does Dr. Teague also actually chart out, in other words, in sort of graphic form, this concept of how new smokers or people who haven't started yet smoking experience smoke and interact with smoke and how confirmed smokers interact? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Does he chart this out?

A.  Page 3, it looks like.

Q.  Okay.  You're right.

So go ahead.  With what has been blown up so far, explain to the jury what's on the screen, what they're looking at.

A. He's explaining the effects of cigarette smoke on three groups, the pre-smoker, who is not smoking at all, the learner, just learning to smoke, and the confirmed smoker, and points out that in terms of response to the nicotine, before you're smoking, we don't know about it one way or the other.

When you're trying to smoke, learning, it's actually quite negative, nausea.  It's quite unpleasant, the nicotine.

But once you're a confirmed smoker, you have to have the nicotine, so it gets three pluses.

And each of these effects are different. The irritancy is negative for the learner but only slightly negative for the smoker.  Flavor matters to the smoker but not to the learner.

Visual appeal, the pack, the cigarette smoke is important for the smoker and not for the

And so there is a long classification of

what's important for the pre-smoker, the learner,

and the confirmed smoker.

Q.  Okay.  Now the pre-smoker is someone who hasn't started smoking yet, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And let's go down to the next section. That's the physical effects.  And does he also do another section on the psychological effects?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So what does that mean, the psychological effects?

A.  Well, like, for example, self-image enhancement.  If you want to be daring, sophisticated, free to choose, for the pre-smoker, this smoking could be a positive for that.

A learner, you know, thinks they're being daring, thinks they're being sophisticated, thinks they're expressing their freedom, they're being an adult, and this is an important image.

But once you're a smoker, you're no longer trying to be cool, trying to be daring, trying to be sophisticated.  You're just basically addicted.

experience.

MR. FURR:  My objection is it's not a proper subject for testimony.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can publish it and indicate what it says.  I can do what is more normal in this setting and ask him to say what it says.  I can read from it myself and indicate what it says.

There's nothing in the way I phrased that last question that is objectionable.

on:  I have lost the issue with respect to whether

Dr. Proctor, a historian, is an expert on

cigarette design.

He's now trying to turn him into an expert on addiction because what he's wanting to do � he's already done it twice, and I let it go.

I've been trying to move this along, but he wants to try to get Dr. Proctor to say that what this document really means � and I can hand it to the Court if you can't see it.

He's going to try to get Dr. Proctor to say what this really means is that people smoke for addiction, even though addiction is nowhere on that page.  It doesn't say addiction.

He's going to try to get Dr. Proctor and trick him to say this man is someone who, after they're past the learning stage, smokes because of addiction.

And it's a slippery slope.  I'm going to � he's not an addiction expert.

The learner gets three pluses, which is indicated here as positive.

A confirmed smoker, in the third column, under the section of free to choose and self-image enhancement, has a negative.

A.  It does.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  Let's go to Page 5, please.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And, Dr. Proctor, do the companies carefully control how much nicotine is in their cigarettes?

A.  They do.

Q.  Why?

A.  It's called precision manufacturing. There's been recognition for a long time that there's a danger if the nicotine goes too low, smokers will be weaned from their habit.  They will no longer be able to create and sustain addiction.

And so there's a type of a sweet spot, a band, a range of nicotine that every cigarette is kept within in order to, as we find in the documents, in order to keep smokers hooked.

Q.  And do tobacco companies manufacture cigarettes with just enough nicotine to keep smokers hooked?

A.  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.

Strike the last answer.

Ask the question again. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  As it relates to the manufacture and control of nicotine in cigarettes, what do the tobacco companies do and why?

A.  They keep the nicotine content of the cigarette in the rod sufficient that it can create and sustain addiction.

Q.  Can tobacco companies manufacture and sell cigarettes that have such low levels of nicotine that they are not addictive and don't sustain addiction?

A.  Of course.  They've been able to do that for many, many decades.

Q.  And how would, Dr. Proctor, historically that � in other words, how would the manufacture of cigarettes that had such low levels of nicotine in it and did not create and sustain addiction, how would that impact disease and death?

diseases?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objection. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, does nicotine addiction have anything to do with tobacco-related diseases?

A.  Of course it does.

Q.  What does it have to do with it?

A.  Well, that's the principal cause of those diseases.  But for the nicotine, there would not be so many people smoking.

Q.  It says here:  Having identified these as highly desirable to the confirmed smoker �

So he's talking about the physical effects?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That's the nicotine-related effects?

A.  Yes.

Q.  � to the confirmed smoker, but largely unpleasant � I'm sorry, largely unknown, unpleasant, awkward, and/or undesirable to the pre-smoker or "learner," the effort here should be to affect a compromise to minimize the undesirable effects while retaining these which later become desirable.

Page 3703 Then he talks about nicotine effects.

Nicotine should be delivered at about 1.0 to 1.3 milligrams per cigarette, the minimum for confirmed smokers.

Did they do that?

A.  They did.

Q.  The rate of absorption of nicotine should be kept low by holding pH down, probably below 6.

Did they do that?

A.  They did that and related manipulations.

Q.  And how did they keep pH down, Dr. Proctor?  What were some of the main mechanisms to keep the pH down?

A.  Well, they'd do it with sugars.  Sugars are the most important constituent that produces organic acids upon combustion.  And those acids counteract the nicotine alkaloid, which is high pH, and it drops the pH down toward that more acidic value.

obligation to advise their witnesses of the

from the trial.

That duty extended to Mr. Gdanski's duty to advise Dr. Proctor what he should not say.

Before I get into when Camel Crush came out, when they sold it, what it exactly is, show it to the jury, identify it as Camel Crush, I planned on approaching.

After that last answer, that they manufactured a menthol ball, I planned on coming up to Your Honor and saying:  Now I would like to

into Camel Crush.

But I need to explain where I'm going and what I'm trying to do so I can lay my predicate.

How can I, you know, come up to Your Honor and we won't be anywhere because we won't know where we stand.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, there's going to be no further guestions on this topic until you guys make your arguments on this one. So �

MR. GDANSKI:  Then I'll make my argument right now.  Now is the � in other words, this would have been and is the appropriate time to make this presentation.  That's the point.

THE COURT:  Was there anything he said in the answer that I need to strike?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  I didn't mention � no.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, the guestion was addressed to me, not you.

Yes, Your Honor, I reguest that you strike the portion of the answer about the menthol ball.

THE COURT:  You don't need to ask the Court why.  It's because of this.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not asking.  I'm rhetorically saying, now let's have the argument as to the appropriateness of discussing Camel Crush.

In other words, maybe that's appropriate and Camel Crush never needs to be stricken because it's perfectly appropriate testimony, because �

THE COURT:  No, it's going to be stricken because it shouldn't have been done until you guys approached the bench.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  So �

THE COURT:  All right.  So what's the next � what's the argument now?

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  The argument now is that I think Camel Crush is perfectly appropriate for purposes of this trial because Camel Crush is a cigarette that was ultimately designed and manufactured, sold by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.

The concept of it is discussed in this 1972 Claude Teague document which talks about a demonstrable novelty in the filter � 1973 document that discusses a demonstrable novelty in

the filter.

The idea is that they're going to argue that none of these ideas from Claude Teague were ever actually implemented with specificity, and that's just not true.

I'm entitled to put in context the document that we have in evidence now to show how it was acted upon, what was generated from it, when it was acted upon.

And I'm entitled to introduce an actual Camel Crush cigarette into evidence, like I've done many, many times with Mr. Furr on the other side.

There's nothing prejudicial about Camel Crush.  Why are they so scared of a cigarette that they actually sell?

Presumably they sell cigarettes that are appropriate and normal.

THE COURT:  What is the relevancy?

MR. GDANSKI:  The relevance, it goes to the fact that they're continuing to make and manufacture cigarettes, present day and in the past many years, that contains demonstrable � in this case, demonstrable novelties in the filter but some component of the cigarette in order to

That's exactly the point, just like he talked about during the conspiracy.

So here's the document in 1973 that says:  In order to attract youth smokers, we should put a demonstrable novelty in the filter.

That's reprehensible.  The kicker, the whole point is, they did it.  When?  Now.  That still goes to reprehensibility.

Their conduct of reprehensibility doesn't just stop when they want to artificially construct a stop date.

They chose to act out and upon the recommendations in this document, and that's why it's relevant.

If they never this demonstrable novelty filter, I would never care about that line in the document, but they did.

THE COURT:  All right.  Response?

MR. FURR:  What counsel did not tell you is when Camel Crush was introduced.  It was introduced in 2007.

The evidence to date from Mr. Shulman's own experts is that he guit smoking some time between 1973 and 1975.  Therefore, this is �

MR. FURR: 2007 is when the product is introduced.  It is not relevant to anything.

THE COURT:  So how is it relevant?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because it shows that they're still doing the same things that go to reprehensibility and entitlement to punitive damages.

THE COURT:  Let me ask you a question: If cigarettes � if selling cigarettes are legal, and if they've got appropriate labels on them now, in 2007, why does it go to reprehensibility?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because you still can't market to youth.  Youth marketing is reprehensible.

You still can't market to youth, legal or not. You still can't do things to manipulate the youth market, and that's what they're doing. That's our case.  That's our position.

Page 3712 appropriate to attract increasing youth to the

market.  That's � it's from their document.

MR. FURR:  What Mr. Gdanski just said is actually very revealing and important for the Court to understand.

The Supreme Court jurisprudence of the United States is abundantly clear that the assessment of punitive damages is not a broad inquiry as to whether the company has done good things or bad things.

It has to be assessed for the specific conduct that injured the plaintiff that punitive damages can be awarded for.

In this case, it can only be awarded for concealment or agreement to conceal.  Neither one of those causes of action are based on youth marketing.  Youth marketing has nothing to do with concealment or agreement to conceal.

And just because it is believed by Mr. Gdanski to be reprehensible doesn't mean it gets to be part of the jurors' calculus as to whether or not punitive damages should be awarded, because it doesn't fit either of the causes of

action

And, therefore, it's irrelevant, and it

MR. GDANSKI:  Just the opposite.  Your Honor has held consistently that youth marketing during the course of the conspiracy goes to reprehensibility.  That's been the basis �

THE COURT:  But this isn't during the course of the conspiracy.  This is in 2007.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, I'm actually not sure where that construct has come from and who has decided when the conspiracy ended, because our position as plaintiffs in the case is that it's never completely ended.

They may obviously disagree, but that's certainly an issue of fact.

And if Dr. Proctor, if permitted � I'm not going to ask about coasting conspiracy because you said no.

But we certainly don't agree and are not on the same page that it has ended at some point in time.  Our position is that it continues on in various aspects.

Putting that aside, though, even if it did end, if they're still doing reprehensible conduct which is the same as the types of conduct

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And those were two of the arms of the conspiracy that you diagrammed previously for the jury, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q. And, sir, the tobacco industry admitted that smoking could cause disease around the year 2000, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And by industry, I mean each of companies that is a defendant in this case, correct?

A.  Separately and collectively, correct.

Q.  And, similarly, around the year 2000, each of these companies, separately and collectively, began admitting, if they had not done so before, began admitting that nicotine could be addictive, correct?

A.  I think the admission that was made at that point was that cigarette smoking could be addictive.

Q. Well, could I have � would you also agree that they began admitting that nicotine could be addictive?

A.  Some did, yes.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.

Okay.  Sir, you would also agree that RJ Reynolds as well as Philip Morris maintains a website today, correct?

A.  They all do, yes.

Q.  And wouldn't you agree that on those websites, both RJ Reynolds, Philip Morris, and all the companies state publicly that cigarette smoking is a cause of serious disease and premature death?

Q.  And wouldn't you also agree that on those � and they have since 2000, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And since 2000, the companies have also maintained websites that advise the public that nicotine � smoking cigarettes and nicotine could be addictive for some people, correct?

that �

THE COURT:  Overruled

THE WITNESS:  � they come close to that.  I think there's a little bit of wiggle room on that.  I know that's also changed over time.

I think the pattern is that it moves from cigarettes � smoking being addictive to nicotine can be addictive over that 2000 period.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Is it also true, sir, that since the 2000 period, that RJ Reynolds has advised the public that adults who do not use tobacco products or have quit should not use tobacco products?

A.  I think they make that claim.

Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.

Is it also true that on those websites, RJ Reynolds, since the year 2000, as well as the other companies, have advised the public that minors should never use tobacco?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Sir, you believe that the formal conspiracy to actively deny or question that smoking causes harm or is addictive has gone away, correct?

A.  Correct.  The conspiracy exists in

In other words, I do not believe it is

of it are in place.

Q. Okay. I'm asking you about the formal conspiracy.

A.  The formal conspiracy, I think, is dissolved.  In other words, most of these bodies are dissolved in, as you were saying, in the late 1990s, but that certain elements of the conspiracy continue on a more informal basis.

Q. You have not seen any evidence since the year 2000 that the tobacco companies have engaged in any conspiracy to conceal material facts about the dangers of smoking cigarettes, correct?

A. Well, I think part of that is true, so long as you realize also my opinion is that the most important things have never been admitted.

So as long as those are consistent, then, yes, as long as I'm allowed to say that too.

Q.  You have a belief in a coasting conspiracy that consists of the companies having not admitted things that you and perhaps others

A.  That's correct.

Q.  But you would agree that since the year 2000, you've seen no evidence among the companies where there is a conspiracy in place to deny the dangers of smoking?

A.  I think that's mostly true.  I think the � it's definitely true that the denial is much weaker.  The problem is more the failure to admit rather than the active denial, but that's my opinion.

Q.  Sir, would you agree that since the year 2000, the company � you've seen no evidence that the companies have engaged in any conspiracy to conceal material facts regarding cigarette design?

A.  Well, so long as � that would be true so long as we also, you know, recognize that there are important failures to admit with regard to cigarette design.

Q.  And that's � the failure to admit is your coasting conspiracy theory, correct?

A.  Well, it's both that and just what the individual companies do not say.

Q.  Now what brought us �

admitting certain things, so it needn't be part of

a conspiracy.

That's sort of why it's coasting because

I don't think it requires maintenance.  It's just

kind of a failure to do certain things.

Q.  You have seen no documentation from the records from the tobacco industry that since the year 2000, the companies have engaged each other to develop a conspiracy not to admit things, correct?

A.  No documentary evidence?

Q.  Right.

A.  I think there's indirect evidence, but you wouldn't expect to see a piece of paper like that.

Q.  Now what brought us here was your discussion of the Camel Crush menthol-related lozenges that you were just testifying about, correct?

A.  Yes � well, I'm assuming that's what it was .

Q.  And that was in the context of a discussion of youth marketing, correct?

A.  Yes, and � yeah, new designs.

A.  Right, for one company.

Q.  So wouldn't you agree that there is no evidence that the tobacco companies entered into an agreement or conspiracy to market cigarettes to underaged smokers?

A.  Like, in general or just recently?

Q.  In general, yes.

A.  No, I think that's fair.  The agreement is not to market to youth.  The conspiracy is really only relevant as it concerns the denial or failure to admit certain aspects of youth marketing, but you're quite right that the marketing to youth was done separately as well as having certain aspects of its admission not being admitted as part of the conspiracy.  So there's kind of a part yes, part no.

Q.  And in a similar fashion, you would agree that you've seen no evidence that the tobacco companies entered into a conspiracy with each other with respect to designing cigarette products that would appeal to youth, correct?

A.  Well, part of that is true, yes.  They are separately designing products to appeal to youth, but there are also aspects of that design

because of the conspiracy.

Q.  They're not conspiring with each other saying:  Hey, got this great idea about how to design a cigarette so it would be appealing to youth, and sharing those ideas, are they?

A.  That's correct, they're not doing that.

Q.  In fact, they're competitors in the marketplace ?

A.  They're both competitors and collaborators.  In other words, they are competitors on market share.  They are collaborators on denial of health effects.

Q.  But with respect to cigarette design, they were competitors, correct?

A.  Well, there is a � they are competitors and collaborators because there are important aspects of cigarette design that were never talked about, so there's an overlap there.

Q.  Have you ever seen any evidence of any tobacco company providing information to another tobacco company with respect to how cigarettes should be designed to appeal to the youth market?

A.  I don't think I've seen that, no.

VOIR DIRE BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q.   So, Dr. Proctor, are there aspects of the conspiracy which continue on in some form today?

A.  Yes, I mentioned the failures to admit the most important facts.

Q.  And you refer to them as failures to admit, but do they also consist as denials when asked about those facts?

A.  I think functionally they do amount to that.

Q.  So, for example, instead of couching it as failing to admit, during the course of the conspiracy, as part of the conspiracy, did the tobacco companies deny that they manipulated

THE COURT:  No, let the witness finish.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Go ahead.

A.  I'm sure there are examples of that, but that's why I think the more important point is the silence, the failure to admit.

Q.  For example, you've read or had occasions to read depositions of scientists and witnesses for the tobacco industry in litigation?

A.  Well, certainly, yeah, they denied it there.

Q.  When employees for the tobacco companies are asked under oath:  Does the industry manipulate nicotine in cigarettes?, they still

A.  That's true, yes.

Q.  The tobacco industry still denies that nicotine addiction causes any disease, right?

A.  That's true.

Q.  The tobacco industry still denies that they ever marketed to youth, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And it's not just a question of don't admit it, but under oath when executives or scientists have an opportunity after being asked the question, they affirmatively deny it, right?

A.  When pushed, they deny it.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Again, the more common thing is the failure to admit.

Q.  So while aspects of the conspiracy were disbanded and are no longer intact, are there also aspects of the conspiracy that continue on nonetheless ?

A.  I believe so.

A.  I can.

Q.  And is that an important part of how the actions taken during the conspiracy, be it, in this case, 1973, sometimes took years to play out in realtime so as to actually effectuate change in cigarette manufacturing?

A.  I guess it could be regarded as part of that.

A.  That sounds right, yeah.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No, I don't know of any distinct documents on that.  That's why I call it coasting really, because I think it's not something that's formally maintained.  I think it's just going on.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  But you don't know of any evidence, documentary, in a deposition or otherwise, that evidences that the tobacco companies have communicated with each other for the purpose of forming an agreement to continue to maintain denials with respect to certain claims about cigarettes and tobacco?

A.  I think that's generally fair.  The only exception, which may or may not be important, would be with respect to litigation.  Obviously, there's certain agreements made in the litigation realm, but that may be a special case.

Q.  Could you also, please, identify for the Court all evidence that you know of, documentary or otherwise, that demonstrates that Camel Crush was introduced in the year 2007 pursuant to the prior formal conspiracy?

A.  Well, it's only really relevant pursuant to the goals that Teague was talking about.  I

I believe it's part of the youth marketing effort, which, you know, I think it's more of a continuation of youth marketing rather than � obviously I don't think � I don't think Philip Morris is helping Reynolds make Camel Crush.

MR. FURR:  Thank you very much, sir.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Any final argument on the issue?

MR. BRENNER:  I just have one issue, Your Honor, not for Dr. Proctor.

Mr. Gdanski said at the sidebar that you have already made a finding that youth marketing is admissible as reprehensibility.  I don't recall that finding at all.

The youth marketing issue, they introduced it because they've said �

THE COURT:  Well, I haven't made any findings.  First of all �

MR. BRENNER:  That's what I thought.

THE COURT:  � I don't make any findings.  I may have made evidentiary rulings.

THE COURT:  But I have not made any specific findings about anything in this case.

MR. BRENNER:  I agree with you.  That statement was made at sidebar, and I just �

THE COURT:  Yeah, so I'm glad to correct that.

MR. BRENNER:  Yeah, okay, because we've made our position pretty clear that � even on the reprehensibility analysis, it has to go to the concealment claims.

And so I just want to make sure that at least my understanding of the state of the record is correct.

MR. FURR:  Yeah, our brief closing argument is we stand on what we argued previously, Your Honor, as the Court recognizes.  It's simply not relevant.

In the case with Mr. Shulman, as testified to by his own experts, appears to have quit smoking somewhere between 1973 to 1975. Camel Crush is introduced approximately 30 to 32 years later.

And, by the way, I should have

Page 3734 elicited � Dr. Proctor does not know these facts,

so I couldn't elicit this from him.  Mr. Shulman

was never a menthol smoker either.

And so now Mr. Gdanski has stretched the concept of reprehensibility beyond recognition.

Anything that he doesn't like that he'd like to argue was bad conduct he believes falls in the category of reprehensibility.

However, as the Court is well aware, Supreme Court jurisprudence is abundantly clear that it has to be limited to the underlying torts that form the basis � the evidence of the reprehensibility has to be related to the underlying torts that form the basis for the cause of the plaintiff's injury.

When you layer Florida jurisprudence on top of that, we now know that is restricted to concealment and agreement to conceal in the State of Florida.

The evidence with respect to Camel Crush in 2007 is simply not relevant to that claim.

THE COURT:  Mr. Gdanski?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  I'm looking for

Page 3735 makes it crystal clear that it's his opinion, his

conclusion, that aspects of the conspiracy

continue on.  They don't get to artificially

construct the end of their conspiracy.

I mean, conspirators don't decide when their conspiracy ended. That would obviously be ridiculous.

And so Dr. Proctor, examining the conduct of the companies, is able to articulate the aspects of the conspiracy, what they were, because, you know, the conspiracy existed through organizations, but it was the people making decisions that was really the fundament of the conspiracy.

And those same decisions, some of them, are still made today.  One of them has to do with youth marketing.  One of them has to do with certain aspects of cigarette design.

They don't like that, that's fine.  They can argue with Dr. Proctor that we've admitted all these things and how could you possibly say we're still concealing information from the public and he can say:  I think there's some things you haven't admitted.  That all goes to cross-examination.

Page 3736 I don't want to be dense about the

issue, but I have a document from a conspirator,

an obvious conspirator, Claude Teague.

And I have cigarettes made by the company he worked for which takes into account the ideas and concepts that he articulated.

So I don't see how it's not able to tie it up.  That's the whole point.  I mean the best evidence, quite frankly, of the ongoing nature of the conspiracy in certain real aspects is the following.

You have a document from the conspiracy that lays out aspects of conspiracy, and you have a cigarette � a cigarette brand that takes them all into account and develops those aspects.

That's it.  I mean, that's the document and the brand.  It doesn't matter what year they're all from.

And just this idea that we've engrafted into the trial that how the companies behave now is not relevant, I don't understand how we've gotten there.  I don't understand how we've gotten to this point.

The jury will be able to decide that they can or cannot award punitive damages.  The

I went back and looked at the last trial we had to see where mitigation was referenced as a jury instruction for purposes of the jury's to determine, and it's in this phase of the trial, not the next phase.

If it's in both, that's fine, but it's certainly here as well.  So this jury can consider, should any party choose to put on evidence, how the company has changed, if they've changed at all.

That's Florida standard, appropriate for purposes of this timing of this cause of action jury instruction, how they've changed, what they've done differently, if anything.

How can I not � how can I � when I've been consistently not permitted to put on what's going on today, do they still do some of these things today, but I checked, and mitigation is

I'm allowed to put on an affirmative �

THE COURT:  How does admitting something or failing to admit something go to the issue of mitigation?

Mitigation usually deals with community efforts that you make, outreach efforts, things like that.

MR. GDANSKI:  That would be mitigation in the context of a criminal who is trying to show he's a good person.

THE COURT:  Then how does � what does the mitigation defense say?

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, mitigation defense says:  You may consider � in determining whether punitive damages are warranted, you may also take � just reading from the last trial we had.

THE COURT:  What are you reading from?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm reading from the final jury instructions, as best as I'm aware of them, from the Cooper trial in which RJ Reynolds and Philip Morris were defendants.

It said:  In determining whether punitive damages are warranted, you may also take into consideration any mitigating evidence.

may demonstrate there is no need to impose

punitive damages against the defendants.

So to answer Your Honor's specific question, the conspiracy �

THE COURT:  That does not define mitigation, does it?  I was trying to ask how mitigation is defined in Florida law.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think it does specifically in that instruction, but I'll give Your Honor an example.

If they marketed to youth, which they clearly do, we put on evidence they marketed to youth, and then they really truly 100 percent did not do it anymore, just no ifs, ands, or buts about it, and they were super against it and genuinely credibly against it, that could be seen as mitigating evidence.

If, for example, during the course of the conspiracy � if during the course of the conspiracy they manipulated nicotine in cigarettes and now they've stopped, they've taken all additives out of cigarettes, that could be seen as potentially mitigating.

It would be interesting.  It would be

in the past, like ammoniate cigarettes and

manipulate cigarettes.  We don't to that anymore.

That's why I should be allowed to ask if they put ammonia in cigarettes today.

All of these things that they did during the course of the conspiracy, an example of mitigation would be not doing them now.  The opposite of that would be continuing to do them now.

So if they marketed to the youth back then and then I got, in Glamour Magazine, marketing to the youth today, or Rolling Stone Magazine from 2013, cigarette advertisements that say, you know, that Dr. Proctor will attest to, if permitted, are forms of youth marketing, that shows the lack of mitigation.  That is perfectly, appropriately relevant.

The FDA, if they're able to, you know, effectuate change. I mean, there's all sorts of different things that go to mitigation.

So after we've had this ruling where the word "today" is an inappropriate word when it comes to cigarette companies, when I asked if they still sell cigarettes, there was an objection

So I think that just what they do today, how they behave today is relevant.  And Camel Crush is sold today.

And one version of Camel Crush, Camel Crush Bold, was � tried to be sold today and the FDA said absolutely not, which is an interesting dynamic, because it shows they tried to do it, but there is some aspect of the force and power �

THE COURT:  All right.  Response.

MR. FURR:  Just two things.

Frankly, that argument sort of rests on a faulty premise.  All corporate conduct, regardless of its nature, is not part of the reprehensibility calculus that the jury is to consider.

The Supreme Court in State Farm versus Campbell was abundantly clear, and on Page 423 stated:  A defendants' dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as a basis for punitive damages.

A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business.

the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate

the merits of other parties' hypothetical claims

against a defendant under the guise of the

reprehensibility analysis.

I mean, in Florida, a reprehensibility analysis is restricted to concealment and agreement to conceal.

THE COURT:  Can I see that case?

MR. GDANSKI:  Can I have one?  Do you have an extra copy?

MR. EDSON:  I have two copies.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  You gave me the section you just read?

MR. EDSON:  Yeah.

MR. GDANSKI:  Perfect.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm listening.

MR. FURR:  Okay.  In Florida, where entitlement to punitive damages is restricted to the concealment and agreement to conceal causes of action, all of these other things that Mr. Gdanski is talking about, the level of nicotine in cigarettes, whether cigarettes were designed to appeal to different segments of the market, including youth, have nothing to do with the torts

Therefore, it's all based on a false premise.

Second, what Mr. Gdanski left out of his recitation with respect to claims being made is, as Dr. Proctor has very candidly admitted, with respect to whether or not there was a conspiracy among the companies to collectively enter into an agreement to design products that would appeal to the youth, it doesn't exist.

THE COURT:  He said that he has no evidence of that.

MR. FURR:  Right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, in looking at this case � and we handed to Your Honor � we handed Your Honor a copy of a memorandum of law on this Williams versus State Farm case because counsel read, thankfully, the complete section here that is appropriate.

And it said:  Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties' hypothetical claims.

That is the entire point.  It is during the portion of the phase of the trial where it is

Page 3744 the calculation of the amount, it's Phase II in

Florida courts, where they determine how much, if

any, punitive damages should be, that this should

not be considered.

However, in this case, in the Williams case, the Supreme Court held that:  It is appropriate to base an award of punitive damages on, quote, the potential harm the defendants' conduct could have caused where, quote, the potential harm at issue was harm potentially caused the plaintiff.

So you can base an award, not the amount, but the entitlement, the entitlement, so not the decision of how much it should be, but in this phase, the only question of punitive damages that the jury is going to be asked is �

THE COURT:  On how it would potentially hurt the plaintiff?  How does something that happened �

MR. GDANSKI:  Not on how it would hurt the plaintiff.

THE COURT:

in 2007 hurt the

plaintiff?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, that's exactly the

point.

question of, should these companies be held liable

for punitive damages, not how much, but should

they be, not the how much but the should, that

question, to answer that question, the Supreme

that in determining that answer, the whether or

You can take into account other conduct that hurt other people.  That's what we're arguing over here right now.

11
	marketing played a role.

12
	Why is this important in light of that?

Reynolds who wrote the memo regarding replacement

smokers, did she have a role in the Joe Camel

campaign?

A.  She did.

Q.  What was it?

A.  She was a brand manager for the Joe

Camel campaign.

Our aggressive plan calls for gains of

about 5.5 share points of smokers, 18 to 20 per

year, 1990 through 1993 (about 120,000 smokers per

year).

So that's if they took the aggressive

approach, they'd gain 5.5 share points of smokers,

right ?

A.  Yeah, that represents percentages of that market.  A share point is like one percent. And 5.5 share points would be five percent of that market.

Q.  Achieving this goal would produce an incremental cash contribution of only about 442 million during the plan period.

A.  Million dollars.

Q.  Million dollars, yes, sir.  $442 million dollars during the plan period (excluding promotion response in other age groups and other side benefits.)

However, if we hold these young adult smokers for the market average of seven years, they would be worth how much?

A.  Over $2.1 billion in aggregate incremental profit.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco industry study the value of 14-year-olds and up and monetize them?

A.  They did.  They calculated the value that could be achieved by capturing these young smokers.

Q.  And after evaluating and calculating, did they take action in furtherance of it?

A.  They did.

Q.  All right.  And have there been deadly consequences as a result?

Lung cancer, you've heard of lung cancer obviously, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So has lung cancer always been a common disease?

A.  No.

Q.  Can you describe for the jury how lung cancer, as a disease process that we know of in society, how it's changed in its rates of prevalence?

A.  Lung cancer was extremely rare prior to the 20th century, the 1900s.  There were only 140 known cases of lung cancer worldwide in the medical literature prior to 1900.

There must have been many that were missed, but nonetheless, autopsy data show that lung cancer was an extremely rare disease prior to the cigarette epidemic.

Lung cancer is mainly a disease overwhelmingly caused by cigarette smoking. That's because cigarette smoke, unlike pipe smoke and cigar smoke, was inhaled.  And it was only when the inhaled poisons of cigarette smoke reached the lungs that they caused lung cancer.

Page 3757 Pipe smoke was kept in the mouth.  Cigar

smoke was kept in the mouth.  And as a result, did

not cause lung cancer.  So the lung cancer

epidemic maps very closely the cigarette

epidemic.

Q.  And we looked at a chart a couple days

ago that � what you described as something called

parallelism.

A.  Yes, the two lines are parallel.  The

lung cancer � the rise of lung cancer very

closely parallels the rise of cigarette smoke.

Q.  And let's use that chart again.  It's

already been shown to the jury.

Page 3758 take us through again as it relates to the

totality of lung cancer and its rise.

A.  The blue line is the cigarette consumption line, which rises and falls.  The red line is the lung cancer line.

And as you see, their rise and fall are very closely parallel because the smoking is causing the lung cancer.

Q.  Now one of the things you talked about was the emergence of epidemiologic evidence �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � at certain moments in time, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So tell the jury, please, what is epidemiologic evidence?

A.  Epidemiology is the science of diseases in large populations.  You wouldn't � in other words, you're trying to find out what causes an epidemic.

So, for example, the famous example is in the 19th century when there was a cholera epidemic in London, early epidemiologists mapped all of the houses where people were getting this disease, and they found they all clustered around one water pump.

Page 3759 And so they went and they took the

handle off the water pump, and you could no longer

drink the water from that poisoned well, and you

cured the epidemic.

So it was � by studying the geography of the illness, you were able to blame the well for producing the bad, infected water.

And the same way with epidemiology, you take two groups, people with lung cancer, people with no lung cancer, and you look back into their past.  What's different about those two populations?

You find that people with lung cancer were much more likely to have smoked than people without lung cancer, after you match them for age, sex, race, you know, occupation, things like that.

So it's a controlled experiment with large numbers of people to find out what's the cause of their disease.

Q.  And in that same vein as the cholera epidemic, what is the number one way to end the tobacco epidemic?

A.  To end cigarettes.  Cigarettes are like the poisoned well in a sense.

Q.  So tell us then, what was the emerging

A.  In 1950 alone, there were five separate epidemiological studies that came to the conclusion that smoking was the cause of lung cancer.

There had been some other studies prior even to World War II.  In Germany there are quite a number of studies.  Even a few in the United States, but the post World War II studies were the most impactful.

Q.  And who were some of the scientists who were doing these epidemiologic studies?

A.  People like Ernst Wynder, Evarts Graham, a distinguished lung surgeon, Richard Doll over in England, A. Bradford Hill, both of whom were knighted for their accomplishments, so people who were young, generally young scholars who were making this discovery.  And then these got a lot of wide attention, and they were honored for their discovery

The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over here, multi-ring, complex organic structures linked with benzene.

Many different metals are carcinogenic. Arsenic is a metalloid.  Nickel compounds can cause cancer, chromium, cadmium, lead.  The radioactive isotope polonium-210 is in cigarette

So there are many dozens of carcinogenic components of cigarette smoke.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Obviously this calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  On the third column, there it is, tobacco-specific nitrosamines.  What are those?

A.  Those are some of the most potent carcinogens in smoke, cancer-causing agents that are known as TSNAs.

They are formed by the nitrosating action of nicotine responding to other chemicals as the smoke is burned.

And they are some of the most potent carcinogens in smoke acting in very small levels, even as a nanogram level, a billionth of a gram. So they're very potent.

commercial use?

A.  As additives, yes, these would not be generally allowed in foods, for example, things like that.

Q.  Now can any one of these be removed from cigarette smoke?

A.  Sometimes, with chemical interventions you can remove one or the other.  The problem is they tend to � some other carcinogen takes its place.

So the analogy is made that the heads are all connected to the tails.  If you take one poison out, you generally allow another in.  So it's hard to just isolate out one element and make it better.

Q.  But wouldn't it be good if we could remove one of the carcinogens?

Page 3764 into the question of which is the one carcinogen

that's causing cancer?

A.  Yes, in the 1950s, there's what I call the single-factor theory.  There was hope that maybe there's only one or two things wrong with smoke, and if you took those out, it would be perfectly safe.

And many in the public health community, many even in the tobacco community inside the industry thought that might be true, that you could take out the one bad thing.

Maybe it's the arsenic.  Maybe it's the benzopyrene, and if you took that out, then smoke would be perfectly safe, and it would be perfectly safe to smoke.  So that's a common misconception that was honestly held in the 1950s.

Q.  Now moving forward in the 1950s a couple years, you mentioned Evarts Graham and Ernst Wynder and Adele Croninger?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what experiment did they do?

A.  In 1953, they published the mouse painting experiments which showed that if you condensed smoke into what's called tar � tar is just condensed smoke, you condense it at a very

And then you take that substance, that black liquidy, gooey substance and paint it on the backs of shaved mice � and you shave them because you can't get hair cancer.  You can only get, you know, living tissue cancer.

So you paint it on the backs of shaved mice.  And the tissues of the back of the mouse are similar to the tissues on the lungs.  They're the same type of cell.

They were able to show, in December 1953, that you could cause cancer on the backs of mice that were vivid tumors.  These were widely reported.  They caused the stock market to crash for tobacco stocks.

Lots of people quit smoking, and that's what actually creates the conspiracy to respond to those mouse painting experiments.

On the other hand, here's another demonstrative that he has, which is a copy of the report of this that was presented to the public, which I would not object to because I think it fairly goes to the notice issue both to the companies and to the public sector.  So I don't have any objection to that, and that's what's usually used.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  So, Dr. Proctor, what year was it that the study of the mouse painting experiment came out? A.  It comes out in December 1953. Q.  Okay.  Before December of 1953, within the confines of Reynolds, was Dr. Teague, the same scientist we've looked at a couple times,

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'd move that into evidence, PT3608.

THE COURT:  So that's admitted into evidence without objection?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT3608 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  I'm not going to go through it page by page.  Just tell us what the importance of this memorandum is from Dr. Teague in 1953.

A.  Teague was a young Ph.D. analytic chemist who was hired by Reynolds in 1951.  And then in 1953, he undertook a survey of cancer research where, based on published evidence, he reviewed the state of the art with respect to whether cigarettes cause cancer.

And he identified the different lines of evidence that were leading to the conclusion that

He had reviewed the epidemiology, the

mouse painting experiments and the identification

of known cancer-causing agents in smoke, notably

the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and comes to

the conclusion that there was very strong evidence

that smoking was causing lung cancer.

Q.  Is there any doubt, Dr. Proctor, that Claude Teague within the confines of Reynolds, based on this paper, was aware that cigarette smoke was connected to cancer?

A.  It's not just he was aware of it.  He knew it.

Q.  Okay.  He knew it?

A.  Stronger.

Q.  Stronger.  Okay.

So ultimately, was the mouse painting studies, was it published or reproduced and discussed in a Life Magazine?

A.  Well �

Q.  I shouldn't say � I'11 rephrase the question.  You can tell me.  That was a bad question, right?

A.  It was.

A.  Yes, they did.

Q.  Tell us about that.

A.  Life Magazine was the most popular large format pictorial magazine.  And on December 21st, 1953, about ten days after they were first published in a scientific journal, Life Magazine did sort of a centerfold spread on the mouse painting experiments graphically showing the little mice with the tumors and the scientists extracting the smoke.

MR. GDANSKI:  And we move the Life Magazine into evidence.  It's AC356. MR. FURR:  No objection. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So this is the cover? A.  It is.

Q.  And is it absolutely normal for the back to have a full-size Chesterfield cigarette advertisement?

A.  That was customary.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll hand that to the clerk in a bit, AC356.

THE COURT:  So that's being admitted without objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit AC356 was received in evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  And let's take a look at a demonstrative we have which demonstrates what's inside the magazine.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So it says:  Smoke Gets in the News.

Dr. Proctor, you used the term "gets in the news" news.  What's the significance of something being news?

A.  Almost by definition, it means that it was new.  It's not old information.  It's new information.

People � most people do not know that smoking could cause lung cancer, very few people did.  We've already seen some surveys about that, where only one percent volunteered that smoking could cause lung cancer when polled for the top of the mind poll.

Here, this was newsworthy.  That's why it caused the collapse of the stock prices. That's why so many people started quitting.

Page 3772 That's why the industry responded with the

conspiracy.

Q.  But why is this newsworthy if, before

this, it was well known that smoking caused

disease and cancer?

A.  Because it was not well known. Q.  Explain that.

A.  Remember, this is the period of mass-marketing.  You know, more and more people were smoking.  Most doctors were smoking.  So it was big news.

A lot of people didn't believe it, didn't understand it, didn't know it.  And they were surprised to find out that cigarettes caused cancer.

Q.  And cancer is obviously different than just being bad for your health, right?

A.  It's much stronger.  There was fear of cancer at this time.  Being bad for you could mean almost anything, you know, that you're naughty doing it or it might make your breath bad or stunt or growth or something kind of vague, but cancer was a life-threatening disease, and that's one of the reasons it got so much attention.

Q.  And in the article, would it be

Page 3773 normal � obviously, this article was that smoking

was linked to disease and cancer, but was it

normal to have quotes from the tobacco companies

giving their position?

A.  By this time, yes.  It becomes more aggressively contested.  Each time new evidence would come out, the industry would respond saying: There's no proof, or:  We need more research, or: There's still room for doubt.

Q.  After this mouse painting study, you said there was � after the Life Magazine article in the magazine, you said that the smoking rates dropped?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.

A.  It's actually not just after this.  The rate begins to drop in 1952 when Reader's Digest and other popular magazines start publishing on the epidemiology.

So there's the epidemiology in 1950. The mouse painting experiments in 1953.  And throughout that period, there's publicity about the harms.

So you see the amount of cigarettes smoked in the United States declining from 1952,

Q.  What was it in Reader's Digest that

you're referring to specifically?

A.  There's an influential article by Roy Norr called "Cancer by the Carton" where, based on the epidemiology in the five studies I mentioned, he says basically:  For every carton of cigarettes that you buy, you're buying a carton of cancer.

Q.  And that scared people?

A.  It scared millions of people.

Q.  Into doing what?

A.  Millions of people quit, started quitting, started cutting down.  That's why we see in the consumption chart a dramatic downturn in the number of cigarettes smoked in 1953 and '54.

Q. So after the mouse painting studies, the Roy Norr article, the Life Magazine story, people get scared.

Did something happen that scared the tobacco industry?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did something happen at this time that scared the tobacco industry?

A.  Yes.

A.  Well, all of these things I mentioned,

the quitting, the publicity, the discovery of the

science that was showing cigarettes caused deadly

harm, all of that was an existential threat to the

entire tobacco industry.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT1044A.  So it's 1044A, we move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  It's being admitted into evidence without objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT1044A was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So along with the resultant decrease in smoking, was there a resultant stock price hit?

A.  Yes, the mouse painting experiments were announced on December 9th, 1953.  And that same day, there was a collapse in the stock prices.

And at that time, the stock market was a lot less volatile than today.  And the major tobacco stocks discovered a five to ten percent drop.  So it was quite dramatic.

There is an objection to it.  This document, if I remember correctly, and maybe we can get a copy of it while we're up here, but if I remember correctly, it has a whole recitation of why we didn't attend this meeting.

The only �

THE COURT:  Liggett & Myers is not participating in the organization because that company feels the proper is to ignore the whole controversy.

MS. RUIZ:  Right.  That statement lacks any foundation or basis for it, and the only � there's another document somewhere that comes up sometimes, and it talks about a letter being read from somebody at Liggett that says that that's why Liggett didn't attend the meeting.

So I think we're all on the same page. It will be admitted subject to the potential redaction which we can argue later so that we don't have to waste time doing it right now. Okay?

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:) Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  So, Dr. Proctor, they met; they issued a document giving background on the cigarette industry, and after that, did another meeting take place?

A.  Yes.  Yes.  Most of that is what you said.

Q.  Okay.  So tell me why I'm wrong and tell

Page 3784 me what �

A.  Well, you said they issued a document. They took some notes.

Q.  They met at the Plaza Hotel on which day?

A.  That's correct, December 14th and 15th, all of the companies with the exception of Liggett met and planned a strategy.

Q.  Okay.  And then what happened on the 15th?

A.  They interviewed the research directors of the four largest companies about their views on addiction and cancer.

Q.  So do we have a document called a Forwarding Memorandum from Hill & Knowlton regarding this meeting on the second day of what transpired during these interviews?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'd move that into evidence, PT2061.

MR. FURR:  No objection. THE COURT:  It will be admitted into evidence without objection.

Page 3785 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So this is the

Forwarding Memorandum to Members of the Planning

Committee.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And just contextualize this for us. What's going on?

A.  Well, this would be the planning committee of Hill & Knowlton, which was handling the public relations operations for the industry.

They had hired them the previous day. They had set about 35 people on to this project, and they're writing about the interviews with the four research directors to find out what they knew about smoking and health.

Q.  Let's go to Page 2.

So it says:  Four interviews with "research directors" are given at some length. One of the men said:  It's fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't break.  Said another:  Boy!  Wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the first to produce a cancer-free cigarette?  What we could do to competition.  Said another:  Suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette less a day.  That would be maybe 40 billion a year.  And, again, the stock market fall

to be much larger next year without EPT.

Right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's EPT?

A.  The earned profits tax, which was expiring at that point.

Q.  So at this point, had the tobacco companies come out and publicly responded publicly to the mouse painting studies?

A.  No.

They were planning that?

Yes.

Did the industry though, Dr. Proctor, intentionally try to free people from the fear of getting sick from smoking?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go to Page 3. I'm sorry, Page 3, Rob.  This is 4. MR. PHILIPSON:  Sorry. Q.  (BY MR.

A.  They were fleeing from the cigarette fearing for their lives.

How to reassure the public? A.  Yes.

Q.  � in a perhaps long interim when scientific doubts must remain.  And, most important, how to free millions of Americans from the guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their biological depths, regardless of any pooh-poohing logic every time they light a cigarette.

Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco companies effectively free millions of Americans from the guilty fear associated with smoking? A.  They did.

Q.  And it says here "public assurance" on

the second line.  It says:  Public assurance and

how to create it.

Did they provide public assurances to

smokers?

A.  They did.

Q.  And were they successful in doing that?

A.  Very.

naturally, that is something almost too terrible

smoking.

attitude toward the findings of men, like Wynder,

Rhoads, Ochsner, et al.

Those were the scientists who were

coming out with the studies, right?

A.  Some of them, yes.

Q.  Some of them.  Okay. Wynder is one?

A.  Wynder pioneered the mouse painting experiments that had caused that stock market collapse.

Q.  So we have a choice, and, Dr. Proctor, tobacco had a lot of choices they could make over time, right?

A.  Of course.

Q.  And we have a choice, as previously indicated of, A, smearing and belittling them; B, trying to overwhelm them with mass publication of the opposed viewpoints of other specialists; C, debating them in the public arena; D, we can determine to raise the issue far above them so they are hardly even mentioned, and then we can make our real case.

Page 3791 Q.  As it relates to overwhelming the public

health community with mass publications of the

opposed viewpoints, did the tobacco companies do

that?

A.  Yes.  That was the whole point of the distraction research.  They funded thousands of articles looking at other causes of cancer that had nothing to do with tobacco.

Q. As it relates to debating the public health community in the public arena, did the tobacco companies do that?

A. They did that. We saw that with Anne Browder and the Truth Squad and the College of Tobacco Knowledge.

Q.  As it relates to raising the issue above the public health community so they're hardly even mentioned, did the tobacco companies try to do that?

A.  Yes, they did.  Yeah, they essentially tried to monopolize the expertise, the framing of the discussion around smoking and health.

Q.  And after this, did the industry decide what to do?  I mean so they met for two days, the research heads.

You know, we talked about the future as

there an immediate decision made as to what to do?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was it?

A.  Well, it was a plan of action.  They founded the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and announced that with the January 4th, 1954, Frank Statement.

Q.  I think we'11 wrap up on that today.

MR. GDANSKI:  We move into evidence The Frank Statement, PT307.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT307 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So The Frank Statement is frank, honest, truthful?

A.  "Frank" means honest and truthful. Q.  Let's put that up.

A.  It did.  It was in over 450 different newspapers.

Q.  Is this an important document when it comes to these tobacco companies and how they manipulated smokers?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  Why?

A.  Well, because it's � it's sort of the Magna Carta of the conspiracy.  It makes the promise to consider health paramount above all other consideration in their business.

It comments on the new mouse painting experiments, that it aroused fear and concern among many people.

It announces that the industry does not believe their products are causing harm, and it makes a certain statement about the evidentiary base of those claims being made.

Q.  Distinguished authorities point out, 1, that medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now was that true?

A.  That was true.

Q.  Does that have anything at all to do with whether cigarettes cause lung cancer?

A.  Sure, it does.  It's � you know, there were other � there were different theories about what caused cancer.

Q.  Can multiple things cause cancer?

It says, Number 3:  That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.

And, Dr. Proctor, was that true?  Back then, was that true there was no proof?

A.  I'll call it misleading, which is sort of halfway in between true and false.  It depends on how you define "proof."

There was no Euclidian proof in absolute certainty, but there was certainly strong evidence that smoking was causing cancer.

Q. How did the industry utilize the concept of misleading statements, so it's like, you know, almost true but also entirely not true?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How did the industry utilize the concept of misleading statements?

A.  Well, they would often capitalize on small truths in order to create bigger lies.  In other words, they would focus on viruses causing cancer to the exclusion of cigarettes causing cancer.

And just by tilting the scales, they were able to push the scientific community away

A.  Yes, the author, the sponsoring agent is the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which had just been formed.

Q. Okay. And then it has the different companies. It has American, Benson & Hedges, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard, Philip Morris, Reynolds, and other tobacco-related entities, right ?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Dr. Proctor, after The Frank Statement was made, are there public promises by the tobacco companies to stop making cigarettes, stop selling them if they ever find out they're harmful?

A.  Yes.  Yes.  I found at least 12 examples

Page 3799 where different tobacco industry authorities say

they will stop making cigarettes if they're ever

proven to cause harm.

Q.  And we're going to show the examples

when we get back last [sic] week.  The last

question, Dr. Proctor, despite the increasing

knowledge of cigarette smoking being harmful and

causing disease, have the tobacco companies ever

lived up to the promise to stop making them?

A.  No.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just a historical fact.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco companies promise to stop making cigarettes �

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, I have to � I guess � when you guys make the objection, will you go back to standing again so that the witness knows not to answer �

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  � because the witness is answering before your objection is out, and then I have to strike his answer.

So I'm going to strike his answer.

I sustain the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How many times did

they promise to stop selling cigarettes if it was

ever determined to be harmful?

A.  Well, I know of at least 12.

Q.  Do they still sell cigarettes?

A.  They do.

Q.  Can they stop selling them if they

wanted to?

A.  Of course.

Q.  Could they choose to stop selling them?

A.  Sure.

Q.  So we'll pick up on these discussions

when we see you soon.  I think it will be Tuesday,

right ?

A.  Yes, Tuesday morning.

Q.  Because you have to teach Monday?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Very good.  Thanks,

Dr. Proctor.  4:30.  Thank you.

Thanks, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.  No problem.

The witness may step down.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we're going to break for the day.

Don't � especially this weekend, don't � you know, because you're going to be away from this process for a little while.

Don't be tempted to do any independent research or investigate anything.  Don't look anything up involving this case.  Don't discuss it with anybody at all or with each other.

And don't post anything on social websites about your jury service or this case, and don't try to look anything up or investigate anything on your own, whether by electronic means or other means.

We'll see you on Monday at 9- � I would say 9:25 in the morning.  Meet the deputy at 9:25 in the morning.

We're not going to come here though.  So you would go to the tenth floor.  So wherever you would normally meet the deputy but do it on the tenth floor.

I think I said earlier the eleventh

we found out � or right before lunch, we found

out that 10B, which is the courtroom right next to

my normal courtroom, is available.

So we're going to do it in 10B.  So meet on the tenth floor on Monday.

Thank you very much.

THE BAILIFF:  Bring your notebooks.

THE COURT:  You'll collect those notebooks and they'll eventually be moved over, I guess?

THE BAILIFF:  Yeah.  I'm going to lock them in the jury room for right now.

(Jury exited courtroom at 4:30 p.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  So we just found out that Judge Keever is done with her trial.  So you can start right away.  The courtroom is open, or will be opened, and you can start taking things apart and moving them over there.

As far as the lawyers are concerned, I don't know � I may have to do � now that Judge � it may make more sense for Judge Oftedal, when he's in my courtroom, to do motion calendar in my courtroom and for me to do motion calendar in 10B because, if not, if Judge Oftedal is

So what you're going to have to do is � I don't know how you're going to set it up, but as far as the � I'm just trying to think.

You guys normally leave your stuff out on the tables.  Is that what you've been doing?

MR. BRENNER:  No.

MR. FURR:  We can clear the table off.

THE COURT:  You could clear the table off each evening?

MR. BRENNER:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Because in the morning, there will be lawyers coming in to do motion calendar.

You can leave things in the courtroom, you know, towards the side where it's not in the way.

MR. FURR:  There might be a couple screens, but we can get all the work product and everything off.

THE COURT: Well, you can leave, you know, boxes and things inside the courtroom as well as in those conference rooms they've given

MR. PHILIPSON:  Can I just go to the stand real quick?

MR. PHILIPSON:  Thank you.

MR. FURR:  One matter, I don't think we were ever told that Dr. Proctor wasn't coming back until Tuesday, but we'll have no objection. That's fine.  I know he has to teach.

I would ask that we avoid, however, a scenario where we start another witness on Monday that we can't finish.

And so that whatever � because obviously we don't want to have another witness do a direct and have my cross languish.

I suspect Dr. Proctor is going to take most of the day Tuesday and Wednesday to finish, based upon my understanding of what they will attempt to do and my cross.

So I would request that we not start a witness Monday that we don't finish and we have to bring back at the end of week.  I think that's

THE COURT:  Well, who are you guys planning to bring on Monday?

MR. HAMMER:  We're not sure yet.  We're going to make that decision most likely tomorrow.

Hopefully we'll have a live witness.  If we don't, we'll just put on one of the videos, and so that won't be an issue if we play a video, because that can be stopped in plenty of time.

THE COURT:  How long does the video go for?

MR. HAMMER:  If we do have a live witness, we're going to try to get that � make sure it's a live witness that we're going to be able to finish on Monday.

THE COURT:  How long is the � the video?

MR. HAMMER:  We're not sure which video it would be.  It depends, you know, what we're doing.

If we have a live witness, depending on how long it takes, we may play a video.  We'll let defense counsel know.

Jury entering.

(Jury entered courtroom at 9:38 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Everybody have a seat.  Thank you.  All right.  I hope you all had a nice evening.  I hope the juror that needed to make the appointment still was able to make it somewhat.  Sorry about the delay.

Ready to proceed?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Dr. Proctor is being recalled.

THE BAILIFF:  Face the clerk.  Raise your right hand.

THE CLERK:  Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the evidence you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do.

THE BAILIFF:  Come over here.  Watch your step as you get up.  That chair does not have wheels.  I need you to speak clearly into the microphone.

MR. GDANSKI:  Please the Court?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Good morning.

THE JURY PANEL:  Good morning.

DIRECT EXAMINATION, CONTINUING, BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Proctor.

A.  Good morning.

Q.  How are you?

A.  Pretty good.

Q.  Okay.  So you were teaching yesterday, huh?

A.  Yes, I was.

Q.  What did you teach?

A.  I taught my History of Ignorance class and my Tobacco and World History class.

Q.  And then you flew back in.  When did you get in?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=940
Page 4072 A.  I arrived here at 7:30 in the morning.

Q.  All right.  Took a red eye?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So we're going to pick off � pick up where we left off last week, and we were finishing up discussing The Frank Statement. Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So just to reorient the jury, let's look at The Frank Statement for a moment, and you can tell the jury � just put us back to where we left off, please.

It's PT307.

So where were we in the context of the story, and where does The Frank Statement fit in?

A.  The Frank � The Frank Statement appeared on January 4th, 1954, as the first expression of this new campaign to reassure the public about smoking.

Q.  And going forward, have you examined the different people who played a role � well, let me back up.

This Frank Statement, it appeared one time?

A.  No � well, yeah, it appears one time in

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=941
Page 4073 450 newspapers, but it also is reprinted in the

tobacco trade press.

Q.  And you see in Number 3, the theme that: There is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of disease, and that:  We will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard public health.

And:  We believe the products we make are not injurious, and:  We accept people's health as a basic responsibility paramount to every other consideration in our business.

For how many years did those themes continue to be part of the tobacco industry propaganda?

A.  Those were themes right through the end of the 1990s.

Q.  Okay.  And so why?  Why in the context of the story is this a pivotal and important document?

A.  It's really the beginning of the public face of the conspiracy, to reassure the public that it's safe to smoke.

Q.  And you used the term "the public face of the conspiracy."  The tobacco companies, they have people working for them, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=942
Page 4074 A.  Yes.

Q.  And have you looked at the different characters, the different people who were the real public faces, either in public or the people doing things behind closed doors, the actual faces of the conspiracy?

A.  Yeah, I have.

Q.  All right.  And we have a slide that has some of these individuals's faces, and you can explain just who is who so we can see the real flesh behind what took place.

You need a pointer.  So we have a demonstrative.

MR. FURR:  No objection to the demonstrative, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you. MR. GDANSKI:  Mr. Philipson is going to grab you a pointer.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How many � while he's doing that, I can ask a couple questions.

You know, we're looking at a slide that has, let's say, 40 people on it.  How many people work at tobacco companies?  Is it 40 or much, much larger?

A.  No, it used to be over 100,000

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=943
Page 4075 altogether, of course most of those are ordinary

workers.

Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

So we have here in the middle the different companies of the co-conspirators.  You have Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard, American Liggett.

Were those the different actual tobacco manufacturing companies that were part of the conspiracy?

A.  Yes, those were the six companies in the center of the diagram I drew.

Q.  And then beneath that, you have the different institutions and entities.  What are those again?

A.  Where are you talking about?  Oh, here?

Q.  There you go.

A.  Yeah, well, there's the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which authored The Frank Statement and is the first arm of the conspiracy constructed.  And it's renamed the Council for Tobacco Research.

And the Tobacco Institute was its offshoot in 1958 to handle Washington affairs.

Q.  And I think we're going to take out the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=944
Page 4076 diagram you drew for us last week.  And are all of those entities � are all of those entities � the companies were in the middle, and are those different entities on the diagram of the arms of the conspiracy? A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  There it is.  So we'll have that � we'll just leave it someplace that's visible and handy.

MR. PHILIPSON:  How about right behind Dr. Proctor?

MR. GDANSKI:  Perfect.

MR. PHILIPSON:  Can I approach, Judge?

MR. GDANSKI:  Just to put that back

there.

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

MR. PHILIPSON:  Hopefully they can see

it

MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  So let's take this down, and you can walk the jury through some of these different characters and just explain what role they played and what kind of documents we're going to see with their names on

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=945
Page 4077 it, please.

A.  Well, this is Bill Dwyer of the Tobacco Institute, one of the spokespersons, especially in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Robert Heimann, I think we may have already seen him �

Q.  Right.

A.  � in a deposition as president of the American Tobacco Company.

Ed Finch, Brown & Williamson president. Each of the companies had presidents, CEOs, numerous executives.

John Hill, the founder of the Hill & Knowlton Public Relations firm, which is over here on my chart as the PR arm of the conspiracy.

Q.  How long did Hill & Knowlton work for the tobacco companies?

A.  They worked most intensively for about 20 years, and then on a lesser basis after that time.  There's � there's a type of minor power struggle in 1969 between Hill & Knowlton and the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  And did John Hill, as part of Hill & Knowlton's archives, also make available some of the Hill & Knowlton documents for people, jurors,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=946
Page 407 anybody to see?

A.  Yes.  Well, that's one of the reasons we have a lot of the early conspiracy documents is because they were released into the archives by the Hill & Knowlton company.

Q.  Let's take down the blowup, and we'll just walk through some of the rest of the folks. Go ahead.

A.  Well, you have Earle Clements who was president of the Tobacco Institute in Washington. He was a senator, a governor of Kentucky and also President Johnson's campaign advisor.

James Bowling, a head of public relations for Philip Morris and the person who talked most about the dysthymia study, a very early � an earlier Tobacco Institute president, scientists from the various companies.

Here, this is the first chairman of the TIRC who was also a former president of Brown & Williamson.

So these are all executives.

Clarence Cook Little, head of the Scientific Advisory Board of the TIRC.

Walker Merryman, another spokesperson for the Tobacco Institute, appears in numerous

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=947
Page 4079 videos.

Ed Horrigan who was president of the Reynolds Company and then later Liggett.

So sometimes these people moved, some of them, from different � one company into another.

Paul Hahn was the chief architect of the entire conspiracy.

Q.  What do you mean by that? A.  Well, he was the head of the largest tobacco company and, therefore, took a guiding role in the early denial campaign, prior even to the conspiracy.

And he was also a lawyer, and so he had a lot of power early on in the conspiracy.

Q.  Were any of these individuals on the board here or people that you see in the context of the conspiracy, in the documents, were any of them ever reprimanded, fired, let go because of what they were doing to effectuate this conspiracy while the conspiracy was ongoing?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was � we have here Anne Browder at the top.  We saw her last week on some of the video clips saying that, you know:  We

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=948
Page 4080 don't market to kids and we don't know how Marlboro got in Superman, Part I.

Was she fired after that interview?

A.  Not that I know of.

Q.  Claude Teague, we've seen some documents from Dr. Teague from Reynolds.  After he discussed unfairly � after he discussed the importance of the youth market or wrote about ammonia or wrote about color changing dyes, was he ever fired?

A.  No.

Q.  Was he ever fired at any point in time as best as you're aware?

A.  I don't think he � he had a long career at Reynolds.

Q.  Any of the scientists who internally were discussing the fact that smoking is addictive or causes cancer and other diseases, were any of them fired as they continued to withhold that knowledge from the public?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Were any of them fired?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  In the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, at any point in time, were any of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=949
Page 4081 these individuals � any individual fired or let go or reprimanded by a tobacco company for being part of the conspiracy?

A.  Not that we know of.  It's possible that there were such that we lost traces of it.

Q.  You mentioned that Earle Clements was a former senator and a campaign advisor to President Johnson?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So was he the only individual in the context of the characters in the conspiracy who had political affiliations?

A.  No, a lot of the early Tobacco Institute people had very powerful political connections.

Q.  And what's the significance of the powerful nature of the tobacco companies and the people who worked for them?

A.  This was a big part of American life.  I mean, it was not some marginal thing.  This was at the corridors of power, you know, pulling lots of the strings.

Q.  Before we broke, we were talking about different examples of instances in which the companies would promise to stop making cigarettes.

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=950
Page 4082 Q.  All right.  So have you specifically researched that in your book?

A.  I have.

Q.  And tell the jury about that and then we'11 look at some examples.

A.  Well, already beginning in the '50s, some of the executives start making this promise to the public, that if anything is ever shown to be � if cigarettes are ever shown to be causing harm, they'll stop making them.

And it's expressed in different ways over the decades.

Q.  How is it expressed in different ways as it relates to private expressions versus public expressions?

In other words, can you compare the times internally where they said:  Hey, if we ever find out it's dangerous, we're going to stop making it versus the public assurance and promise to stop making it if it's ever dangerous?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Can you compare the public statements about promises to stop making it versus the private internal statements of promises

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=951
Page 4083 to stop making it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Go ahead.

A.  Well, there's an important distinction there.  There actually are a couple of instances prior to the conspiracy where privately, in their own archives, they would say:  We don't want to make a product if it's hurting people.

After 1953, you only find that reassurance or that statement publicly.  You never find it privately.

Q.  What's the significance of that?

A.  Well, I think it's honest before the conspiracy and dishonest after the conspiracy, and that's the only way to make sense of that record. In other words, you look in vain for an example internally of them saying:  We really don't want to make a product that's harming people, after '53.

But before '53, you do find that.  And that's a fundamental shift, and I think it's a shift in their honesty.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's take a look at one example, PT3785, 3785.  We move that into evidence.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=952
Page 4084 MR. BRENNER:  No objection, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's admitted into

evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT3785 was

received in evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And so this is A

Statement to NAMA Meeting by George Weissman.

Who is George Weissman?

A.  George Weissman was vice president for

marketing at Philip Morris.

Q.  And it's called Facts Versus Fancy,

1954.

So this is a month and a half, two

months after The Frank Statement?

A.  It is.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 8, please.

Now this is a public speech, right?

A.  It's a public speech to basically the

Vending Machine Association of America.

Cigarettes were important for vending machines.

Q.  I know this is your position as well as

ours.  If any one of us believed that the product

we make � I'm sorry, the product we were making

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=953
Page 4085 and selling was in any way harmful to our customer's health, and our own as well, we would voluntarily go out of business. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  At this point in time, did the industry have internal research documenting that smoking was linked to carcinogens and cancer?

A.  They did.

Q.  Before � before The Frank Statement, had some of the companies done studies on what it was specifically internally, in their own internal labs, on what it was that was causing smokers to get cancer?

A.  Yes, or harm more generally.

Q.  Or harm generally.

So can you describe, before we see this in 1954, what some of the companies are doing internally as it relates to linking smoking to cancer?

A.  Well, they're doing several things. One, there are secret experiments at the American Tobacco Company trying to find out whether it's the paper or the tobacco that's making cigarettes so deadly.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=954
Page 4086 There was an honest question:  Why are

cigarettes causing so much harm, unlike cigars?

And one of the questions at the time

was:  Maybe it's the paper that makes them so

deadly.

And so did they experiments, secret

experiments at the Ecusta Paper Company, which

made all of the world's cigarette paper, to find

out whether it was the paper or the tobacco that

was responsible for lung cancer.

Q.  Which company did this?

A.  That was the Ecusta Company, financed by the American Tobacco Company, in collaboration also with Lorillard.

Q.  So American is looking at whether or not it's the tobacco or the paper that's causing disease.  What did they find?

A.  Well, they found it was the tobacco, not the paper.

Q.  And despite studies that show that it's the tobacco, not the paper, did they still come out with The Frank Statement and say there's no proof?

A.  They did.

Q.  Are you � how many examples of the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=955
Page 4087 companies' making public promises are you familiar with?

A.  Well, there are at least 12 that I've found.

Q.  Is it just from one company or many or all?

A.  I think all the companies.

Q.  We have an example, PT2717, from the Wall Street Journal, "Defending the Weed."

Are you familiar with that article?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were there newspapers that discussed the situation as it relates to tobacco causing disease:  Tobacco is not healthy for you.  It can be hazardous.  It is hazardous. Did that exist?

A.  All the time.

Q.  Tell � remind the jury again, what's the volume of the stories out there that's linking smoking to disease?

A.  Well, it would be many thousands, many thousands of stories.  Every time there was new scientific proof that it was causing lung cancer or some other disease, there would be widespread publicity of this on every medium.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=956
Page 40 MR. GDANSKI:  And let's take a look at

an example, PT2717, "Defending the Weed" from the

Wall Street Journal, 1972.

We move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  All right.  So that will be

admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2717 was

received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  It says:  Defending

the Weed, How Embattled Group Uses Tact,

Calculation to Blunt Its Opposition.

The "embattled group" is the tobacco

companie s, right ?

A.  Right.

Q.  And, Dr. Proctor, did they use tact and

calculation to blunt their opposition?

A.  They did.

Q.  It says:  Tobacco Institute manages

cigarette firms' strategy; they win while losing.

What's just the significance of what's

going on in the title?

A.  Well, there's more and more evidence

coming out all the time about the many deadly

harms of cigarettes, but somehow the Tobacco

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=957
Page 4089 Institute and the other arms of the conspiracy

were able to keep cigarette sales growing.

Q.  Were cigarette sales growing after The Frank Statement, after 1954 mouse painting studies?

A.  Yeah, they grew for nearly 30 years after that point.

Q.  It says:  If our product is harmful, says James Bowling, vice president of Philip Morris, we'll stop making it.  We now know enough that we can take anything out of our product, but we don't know what ingredients to take out. In 19- � is it 20 or �

A.  20.

Q.  � 20, it was accepted as scientific fact that smoking caused TB. What's TB?

A.  Tuberculosis.

Q.  It was later found out they had no connection after some states had even outlawed smoking.  We don't know if smoking is harmful to health, and we think somebody ought to find out.

So at the top he says:  We'11 stop making it if the product is harmful.

This is 1971, after the Surgeon

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=958
Page 4090 General's report?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  What's the significance of this, now 20 years � or 15, 16 years after The Frank Statement, after the Surgeon General's report, another public promise in a newspaper to stop making it?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Why is this significant?

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, could I get a ruling on my objections before counsel �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll withdraw my question.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, sir.  Could I get a ruling, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What's the significance of this as it relates to smokers relying upon the message of the tobacco industry?

A.  It's the ongoing reassurance:  We, the Tobacco Institute, are taking responsibility and being honest about this problem.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=959
Page 4091 Q.  And did the public statements from the tobacco companies, the ongoing reassurance, did it influence and impact smokers?

A.  Of course it did.

Q.  Just describe the scope of that.

A.  Well, recall that the consumption rate was declining dramatically in 1953 and '54.  That decline is reversed and continues to grow for 30 years after.

That's the success of the reassurance campaign.

Q.  Are there examples, even as late as 1990s, 1996, '97, '98, where CEOs of some of the companies were publicly saying:  We will shut down our factory if it's proven to be harmful?

A.  They kept saying that, yes.

Q.  And are you familiar with an example of that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you know who Geoffrey Bible was?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Which company was Mr. Bible the president of?

A.  Philip Morris.

Q.  And you've seen statements from him

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=960
Page 4092 where he discusses what the company will do even as late as the late '90s �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � what Philip Morris will do if it's determined that smoking is bad?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We move into evidence and play for the jury PT06141.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, disclosed to us for this witness was an article in a newspaper reporting on Mr. Bible's testimony, which I was fully prepared to argue was hearsay and obviously can't come in.

What they're about to show was not disclosed to us on their Proctor list.  And it's just taking out � actually, I don't know what it's taking out, to be honest with you, because all I had � then I understand �

THE COURT:  This is an undisclosed document?

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  We're going to come back to that clip, but I do want to discuss it.

What's the � you know, we looked at an example from the '50s, '70s, and Mr. Bible, the president of Philip Morris, that was in the late 1990s?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  So why is it significant that even as late as the late 1990s, the CEO of Philip Morris is still saying:  We'll shut down the factory if we have any � you know, if cigarettes are determined to be hazardous to health?

A.  Well, it's the continuation of the conspiracy over many decades.  It shows how late these same denials are going on, these same reassurances.

Has Philip Morris ever shut down their factories?

A.  No.

Q.  Do they continue to make an astronomically large number of cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Still number one cigarette company in the world � in America?

A.  In America, certainly, yes.

Q.  And Marlboro is still their flagship brand?

A.  It is.

Q.  The Philip Morris Company, they had a logo with words "veni, vidi, vice" on it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What does that mean, veni, vidi, vice?

A.  That's Latin for:  I came, I saw, I conquered.

Q.  It used to be on the cover of the � describe what it was?

A.  It was a little logo under the horses of the sort of royal insignia on every pack of Marlboro.

Q.  In 1954 when The Frank Statement came out and before that with the mouse painting studies in the magazine we looked at, was there also publicity in the news, on television?

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=964
Page 4096

Q.  And how, how did television become sort of an emerging place where people can get their news and how did the tobacco companies use that to get their message across?

A.  Television doesn't really even become commercial in the United States until the late 1940s.  Of course, it's black and white until the '60s mostly.

And the industry would � or the separate companies would regularly appear on television advertising, reassuring the public. It's one of the many mediums that they influenced.

Q.  And we have a couple of examples. You've heard of the show and you've seen clips from "See It Now"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what was the show "See It Now"?

A.  That was the most popular evening news show, something sort of like 60 Minutes today, run by Edward R. Murrow, the great war correspondent from World War II, who, in 1955, he did a whole two-hour special just on this question of lung cancer and cigarettes.

Q.  And when the news, whether it was

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=965
Page 4097 television or newspapers, when the news would report on smoking and disease issues, was it just a story about smoking causing disease from people who said it did, or did the tobacco companies manage to get their message across?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco companies get their message into the news?

A.  Very often, yeah, that was the whole point of the Hill & Knowlton part of the enterprise, was to contact, through their elaborate media contacts, science writers, journalists, university presidents, anyone who might have a public opinion on this.

And so they would contact the television shows.  And actually the ones who were seen, they helped construct this show.

MR. GDANSKI:  So let's take a look at a couple of clips.  We have PT1682BA.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's put up just �

THE COURT:  So that will be admitted into evidence without objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do you know who Robert

DuPuis was?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Who was Robert DuPuis?

A.  He was the vice president for research and development at Philip Morris.  He's later replaced by Helmut Wakeham in 1959.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's take a look at this clip, please.

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  As Dr. Little said earlier, all of the research of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee is done independent of the cigarette companies.

Nonetheless, each major cigarette purchaser has been conducting its own experiments on this problem.

This is the Richmond Laboratory of one of the major producers.

VOICE:  I am Dr. Robert N. DuPuis, chairman of the Industry Technical Group of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=967
Page 4099 Our primary objective is to analyze all

of the components of smoke.  Of course we do a

great deal of research on analysis and technology

of tobacco itself.

But even if we knew all of the components of tobacco, we still would not know the components of smoke.  And since smoke is what we sell, we feel that we should emphasize this phase of research.

After we have produced the smoke and separated it into fractions, the next step is to identify these fractions.

These are then identified either photographically or on the oscilloscope.  The oscilloscope is now demonstrating the means of identification of one of the smoke components.

Using these instruments, we have isolated and identified some three dozen components of smoke.  Many more will be identified.

As we find these components, we've published the results of our work in technical journals which are available to any scientist in any part of the world.

So far we've found none that give us any

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=968
Page 4100 cause for concern.  If we do find any that we

consider harmful, and so far we have not, we'll

remove these from smoke and still retain the

pleasure of your favorite cigarette.

(Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, why is there tar in smoke?

A.  Well, that's like saying why is there H20 in water.  Tar is just condensed smoke �

Q.  What do you mean by that?

A.  � without the gaseous phase.

Smoke is an aerosol.  That means it has a particle phase and a gas phase.  And the particle phase, if you condense it with cold, it's what we call tar.

It's a sort of a black, liquidy substance that contains everything in smoke except for the gaseous phase, carbon monoxide, some of the gaseous phenols, nicotine, insofar as it's in a gaseous state, cyanide, polonium.

So there's a gas phase and a particle phase.  Tar is just the particle phase.  In other words, condensed smoke.

Q.  So when people see or hear about levels of tar and nicotine in cigarettes, what does that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=969
Page 4101 mean?

A.  Well, it's a bit of a misnomer because it's � it's � tar is just condensed smoke.  So the more smoke there is, the more tar there will be .

There's not really levels of tar in smoke.  Tar is condensed smoke.

Q.  And can � can and do the tobacco companies' control very precisely the levels of tar and nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Well, you have to separate those two things out because you can't really control the tar.  It's just � that just depends on how big the cigarette is.

That's � more smoke, more tar.  But they can and do control the amount of nicotine in the rod and, therefore, in the smoke.

Q.  And they control it at levels to accomplish what goal?

A.  Well, to create and sustain addiction.

Q.  Is that still the design feature and parameter of cigarettes?

A.  It is.  Nicotine is a single substance. Tar is sort of all of the substance minus the gas phase.

pgNbr=970
Page 4102 Q.  On this clip from Edward R. Murrow in 1954 or 5, what year was it?

A.  That's '55, the year. Q.  1955, were there also clips from scientists, people who had published in the scientific literature saying:  Smoking is bad. You should quit, and the choice is yours now?

A.  Yes.  Yes.  E. Cuyler Hammond appears with his punch cards and a computer, and he talks about how it's been proven that smoking is causing cancer.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have that clip, PT1682LE.  Move that into evidence. MR. FURR:  No objection. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  So who was this E. Cuyler Hammond?

A. This is E. Cuyler Hammond who was in the American Cancer Society doing statistical work, the first �

THE COURT:  So that last one was no objection to the document coming into evidence? MR. FURR:  To this exhibit, yes, sir. THE COURT:  All right.  So that will be admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1682LE was

pgNbr=971
Page 4103 received in evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So who was E. Cuyler

Hammond?

A.  E. Cuyler Hammond, with a guy named Daniel Horn, did the � some of the first prospective epidemiology, in other words, taking healthy people, smokers and nonsmokers, following them over time to see which one was more likely to get cancer, thereby avoiding the recall bias of earlier retrospective studies.

The retrospective studies, there was always the possibility you would misremember what your smoking had been in the past.  You might blame yourself.  If you had cancer, you might exaggerate how much you had smoked.

This eliminated that recall bias and was a more reliable estimate of the relevant risks of smoke.

Q.  Is that what recall bias is?

A.  Recall bias is the danger of misremembering and, therefore, polluting your statistics.

MR. GDANSKI:  So let's take a look at this clip from the Edward R. Murrow "See It Now"

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=972
Page 4104 show featuring E. Cuyler Hammond, please.

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  In 1952, Drs. Hammond and Horn

of the American Cancer Society began an extensive

study of the smoking habits of American men.

Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the

results of the first two years.

VOICE:  It is now established, in my

opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette

smoking greatly increases the probability of

developing lung cancer.

In my opinion, people should be warned

of the danger, and they are being warned.  What

they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke

or not, is their own business.

(Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And, Dr. Proctor,

what's the significance of a statement like that

where he says:  People are being warned?

A.  Well, he is pointing out the truth, that

there were these popular magazines reporting on

this emerging science.

Q.  The emerging science that they're

discussing, did that reference the importance and

scope of nicotine addiction?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=973
Page 4105 MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did that clip we just

saw reference the importance that nicotine

addiction played in smoking?

A.  No.

Q.  So why is that significant?  As we think about how the message has come out over time and the information has come out over time, why has the role that nicotine has played in continued smoking something that's important to keep into perspective?

A.  The role of nicotine is poorly understood at this point.  Nicotine was most commonly viewed as kind of a negative thing in smoke, one of the many poisons or irritants, along with ammonia and things like that.

And after the '50s, it becomes better understood that nicotine is the molecule creating addiction.  At least inside the industry, it becomes better understood.  It's understood later in the public health community.

But this is a big shift from nicotine being the bad thing in smoke to being the sine qua non or the thing you have to have in

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=974
Page 4106 smoke.

So it's sort of tar and nicotine are the categories that are developed to talk about this by the industry, the tar essentially representing the cancer and the nicotine representing the addiction.

They didn't like the cancer.  They needed the addiction, and so that becomes one of their concerns.

Q.  On this same show, was there a clip from someone from the American Medical Association? A.  Yes.

Q.  So remind the jury the relationship between � you have it up there, AMA-ERF.

Remind the jury of the relationship between the American Medical Association and the tobacco industry?

A.  Well, it changes over time.  In the 1930s, the American Medical Association allowed cigarette ads in their journals, in JAMA and the other journals of the American Medical Association.

That stops in 1953 when it's recognized, especially in the medical profession, that this is causing harm; they shouldn't be advertising

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=975
Page 4107 cigarettes.

Later, in 1964, the industry pays $20

million to the AMA and essentially buys their

silence on the crucial issues of smoking causing

harm.

But in this interim period of 1955, Hess

is, I think honestly, expressing his ignorance.

He's a smoker.  He doesn't think it causes him any

harm.

Q.  I was just going to ask you that.  Let's

just set the stage.

At this time in 1955, the American

Medical Association is not beholden or bought by

the tobacco industry, correct?

A.  Not really, no.

Q.  Okay.  This is the head � this is the

head of the American Medical Association?

A.  Yeah, he's the president-elect,

president-elect of the entire organization.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT1682E.  Let's move that

into evidence from the same show.  Play that.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's admitted into

evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1682E was

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 410 received in evidence.)

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  This Tuesday, Dr. Elmer Hess of Erie, Pennsylvania, becomes president of the American Medical Association.

He speaks now, however, as a physician who does not believe there is any important relationship between smoking and cancer.

VOICE:  How do you account for the rise in lung cancer?

VOICE:  Well, I think � I don't think smoking cigarettes particularly has anything much to do with it in the first place.

VOICE:  Are you a smoker, Dr. Hess?

VOICE:  Yes, sir, and I can't see where it's done me a great deal of harm.

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So:  It hasn't done me a great deal of harm.  I don't think smoking causes disease in the first place.

What's the obvious importance of the head of the American Medical Association saying something like that?

A.  Well, this is a time when half of � actually over half of all doctors smoked

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=977
Page 4109 cigarettes.

Again, you're more likely to smoke if

you're a doctor than not a doctor.  That's how

safe it was still thought to be to smoke.

Q.  What kind of influence does the head of the American Medical Association or physicians in general saying things like this, that, you know: Smoking is not dangerous?

What does that have on the public, the smoking behaviors of any one smoker?

A.  Well, they're obviously a medical authority.  I think it's more a symptom of how almost everyone thought that cigarettes were pretty safe at this point.

Q.  You mentioned Daniel Horn a few minutes ago.  I don't want to forget him. Who was Daniel Horn?

A.  Daniel Horn was the guy alongside E. Cuyler Hammond who did the first prospective epidemiological studies, taking healthy � taking smokers and nonsmokers and looking forward to see which would be more likely to get cancer.

MR. GDANSKI:  And we have PT2583.  We'd move it into evidence, 2583, a newspaper article from the Greensboro Daily News.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 4110 MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's admitted.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2583 was

received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And have you seen statements from Daniel Horn where he talked about: You could shout from the rooftops, and you won't tell anybody something they don't know, smoking being dangerous?

A.  One statement, yes.

Q.  One statement where he says that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And is this another article from January 1972?

Let's take a look at some of the portions of this.

Okay.  Daniel Horn, director of the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health. What was that office?

A.  That's the body that would issue the Surgeon General's reports.

Q.  Why, a reporter asked, shouldn't a person, quote, have the right to destroy himself if he wants to?

Horn answered:  Over half of the people

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=979
Page 4111 who smoke today have tried to quit smoking and failed, some so shatteringly that they have vowed never to try again.  So these are people who have lost their right not to smoke.  It's a vicious habit.

What's the significance of that, Dr. Proctor?

A.  Well, he's recognizing aspects of addiction, that it's � smokers are really not � at least many smokers are not free to choose.

They've had their freedom robbed from them.  They've lost the freedom not to smoke.

Q.  Has that been demonstrated from the tobacco industry documents to be what the industry understood?

A.  Yes.  In the very � in the forwarding memorandum, already 1953, they say:  Fortunately for us, it's a habit they can't break.

Q.  Did the industry put out press releases?

A.  All the time.

Q.  So what's the scope and significance of the industry's press releases?

A.  They would typically appear to respond to some threat to their business, typically a scientific article, you know, verifying a new type

Q.  Believing, as we do, that cigarette smoking is not injurious to health, I feel that a statement of reassurance � reassurance to the public should be made.

Do you see that?

A.  Yeah, this is from about three weeks before the conspiracy.

Q.  Did they do that?  Did they make statements to reassure the public that smoking was not dangerous?

A.  They did.

Q.  Did those statements work?

A.  Yes, they reassured the public.

Q.  And we looked last week at the chart of cigarette consumption and the dips and the ebbs and the flows.

Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How can we prove � I mean, forget how can we.

Can you demonstrably, factually, and specifically prove that the statements of reassurance actually work?

A.  Well, you can certainly show that people kept smoking in ever greater numbers after this

MR. GDANSKI:  Can you put up the chart? We've shown this demonstrative already.

MR. BRENNER:  Just for clarification, I think that was part of the composite exhibit.  And we'll have the same � we'll view them one at a time when they come up, Your Honor.

One was up, we had no objection to it.

THE COURT:  So subject to that, we'll admit it into evidence.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR.

Okay? A.  Yeah. Q.  Okay.  So let's just focus on '50 to

65?

MR. GDANSKI:  Can you blow that up, Rob? MR. PHILIPSON:  Yeah.

MR. GDANSKI:  And I need a pointer also. Perfect.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=983
Page 4115 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So just in this little

isolated time frame, explain how the industry successfully � successfully reassured the public who was relying on them?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  You saw Mr. Heimann's clip last week that � the tobacco industry statements, they intended the public to rely on them?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Can you explain how that process worked?

A.  Well, the new evidence coming out that's powerful showing that cigarettes cause harm is published here in the early 1950s.

Reader's Digest reports on it, "Cancer by the Carton."  People start fearing for their lives, and they drop significantly in their cigarette consumption right here.

It may not look like much, but it's about 20 or 30 billion cigarettes smoked fewer over that period per year actually.

And then The Frank Statement appears right about here (indicating), and the overarching

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=984
Page 4116 reassurance campaign, the conspiracy, all of these

bodies here.

And they say:  Mice are not men.  You

can't rely on statistics.  Everyone is different.

Freedom of choice, you know, not a dangerous

product.

And so they effectively reassure the

public during this period, and it continues to

grow in cigarette consumption.

Q.  And we'll get to it again, but I don't want to have to repeat it.  The jury is going to see and has heard that, in 1964, a Surgeon General's report comes out?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  So you have another little dip, right ?

A.  Right.

Q.  And after 1964, was there the continued campaign of reassurance to smokers who were relying on it?

A.  It continues for decades.

Q.  And after that campaign picks up, a progression, is there another spike?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And do you see that theme throughout?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=985
Page 4117 A.  Yes.

Q.  In newspaper articles, you talked about

the importance of the tobacco industry getting

their message across?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI: We'd move into evidence a couple of examples. It's PT3068, 9056, 3021, and 3122.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  These are admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit Nos. PT3068, 9056, 3021 and 3122 were received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And we have just a demonstrative.  I don't need to read through each one, Dr. Proctor, but explain just the theme and the importance of what we're looking at.

A.  Well, we saw the press release that Paul Hahn issued.  This is an actual New York Times picking up on that, using Hahn's expression of "loose talk," that all this talk about cancer is just really loose talk.

And so this is � these are examples, and there are thousands of these, of trivialization articles repeating the industry's

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=986
Page 411 theme that there's really no proof that smoking

causes harm.

Q.  Trivialization, did the tobacco

companies trivialize the claim that smoking is

harmful or that nicotine is addictive?

A.  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's cumulative, Your Honor.  We've gone over this many, many times.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think that's accurate.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule it.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Just � can you give the jury some examples.  We'11 see the specific documents, but examples of different substances or candies that the industry would use to compare tobacco to?

A.  They would compare it to gummy bears or watching television.  We're kind of all, you know, addicted or habituated to jogging or to eating or to coffee or tea or � you know, they trivialized it by comparing it to ordinary, you know, consumer products, you know, potato chips, things like that.

Q.  What's the gummy bears comparison?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

CEOs actually says:  Well, you know, I like my gummy bears.  I need my gummy bears.

A.  From Philip Morris. Q.  Thank you.

Now how did the industry, over time, starting with the '50s, use science, and how did they use science to sort of, from their perspective, take the high ground in saying: Science doesn't support what the public health community is saying?

A.  Science was central to the conspiracy. They published or funded the publication of literally thousands of articles.

The whole point of the TIRC was to do distraction research.  Research that, you know, does not support the claim that cigarettes cause cancer.

They did this by supporting alternative

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=988
Page 4120 causes, research.  I think I mentioned viruses,

air pollution, occupational causes of cancer,

hormonal causes of cancer, dietary causes,

anything but tobacco.

And they effectively infiltrated the scientific community by this way and not only created these alternative causations but also created allies in the scientific community who could be used in any of the three pillars of the conspiracy, you know, public relations, litigation, legislation, people who serve as �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  I guess I need to approach.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, in that last answer, the witness, once again, worked the companies' legislative activities into his claims about the conspiracy.  The Court has ruled that out.

THE COURT:  That was in the answer?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

And he's told counsel to stay away from the issue.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 4121 THE COURT:  I think I told the witness.

MR. FURR:  I think you told the witness also, and that has been done again.

THE COURT:  Let's see here.  It said: Public relations.

I don't think he actually � oh, legislation, but he didn't say lobbying.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  I mean �

THE COURT:  He said:  ...in the scientific community who could be used in any of the three pillars of the conspiracy, in public relations, litigation, legislation �

MR. FURR:  Right.

MR. GDANSKI:  What's wrong with that?

MR. FURR:  Legislation is influencing � influencing the enactment of law is lobbying. That's what we're talking about.

THE COURT:  Obviously the tobacco companies are not legislators, so they'd have to be lobbying.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  It's not lobbying.

THE COURT:  It's a reference to lobbying.

Okay.  So I'll give a corrective instruction.  I'll strike the answer, and I'll

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=990
Page 4122 give a corrective instruction.

I need the witness to come here again.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I just would like to make my record at least.

There is nothing wrong with the witness's answer.  In fact, it's the truth, and it comes from the tobacco company internal document about the three pillars of the conspiracy.

He's not making this up.  They have documents that talk about the three �

THE COURT:  Are these documents in evidence?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll put them into evidence right now then.

MR. FURR:  It doesn't make it admissible.  The fact that we talk about our lobbying efforts does not cause us to waive our first amendment privileges.

THE COURT:  All right.  I need the witness to come up here.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, while he's coming up, I'll just let you know, I think with the Bible testimony before, I actually heard Mr. Gdanski say a different exhibit number than he said.  I have the exhibit number that he said.

value at all, and the jury should disregard it.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  I think we were

talking about scientific publications, how the

industry used that, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And then you went and you

described the pillars of the conspiracy, right?

A.  I mentioned that.

Q.  Okay.  Did the industry, did the tobacco

companies, through their spokespeople, at points

in time, look back retrospectively and sort of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=993
Page 4125 take stock, you know, see what have we done, what has happened and how has it happened?  Did they do that?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And were their perceptions just spot on?

A.  Very often, yeah.  They go to the root of the matter.

Q.  They got to it because they knew what they were doing, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And you know who � we talked about the Tobacco Institute.

Did � as part of the Tobacco Institute for the tobacco companies, did they have documents where they would say:  Hey, here's what we're doing.  Here's the pillars of what we're doing. Here's how it worked?

A.  They reflect on what they're doing.

Q.  Did they identify with crystal clarity, in a crystal-clear fashion the three primary components of their fraud, their conspiracy?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And do we have �

MR. FURR:  Objection.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do we have the

Page 4126 document that we can share with this jury from the Tobacco Institute for �

THE COURT:  Was there an objection? MR. BRENNER:  We haven't gotten the number yet.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, I'm not there yet.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do we have the documentary piece of evidence from the Tobacco Institute which demonstrates the three primary components of the fraud and conspiracy?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And PT2050, you're familiar with something called The Roper Proposal?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  What was The Roper Proposal?

A.  This was from 1972.  It's a Tobacco Institute internal memorandum reflecting back on the history of the enterprise.

Q.  Okay.  And you say May 1, 1972.  It's from Fred Panzer, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Who was Fred Panzer?

A. Fred Panzer was a public relations guy at the Tobacco Institute who earlier had been a press secretary for Lyndon Johnson.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 4127

Q.  And there was two, Horace Kornegay.  Who was Horace Kornegay?

A.  Yes, he was his superior at the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  '72 is almost 20 years after they started this campaign of doubt, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what does the industry recognize that for nearly 20 years, the industry employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts?

Does the industry identify the three major fronts?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And does it discuss what those fronts were and specifically identify how the industry defended itself and manipulated public perception on those three fronts?

A.  It mentions that, yeah.

Q.  It mentions the litigation front, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And in doing so, does it discuss how the industry worked on the litigation front?

A.  Well, it does.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=996
Page 412 Q.  Okay.  Does the industry, the Tobacco Institute, in looking back, describe the brilliant nature of their plan?

A.  That's the words they use.

Q.  That's their term.

While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us win important battles, it is only fair to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be, a vehicle for victory.  On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy, right?

A.  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Gdanski is reading a document that's not in evidence.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  The term "holding strategy," have you seen that term "holding strategy" in tobacco company documents?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  So what's � when you get to a term like that, what's the significance of it?

A.  Well, as they say, it's not a vehicle for victory; it's kind of a holding or delaying strategy.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=997
Page 4129 The writing was on the wall, but, you

know, anything they could do to delay it would, you know, benefit them.

Q.  And did they successfully delay any kind of significant change when it comes to smoking and behaviors in this country?

A.  Yes, that's really the whole point of the conspiracy.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT2050, we move that into evidence, The Roper Proposal document we're discussing.

MR. FURR: Objection, Your Honor. We have to approach.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR: I am a little astounded at how counsel flaunts your rulings, especially in light of the last sidebar.

Although that question does not tip you off, Your Honor, as to what's in this document, the document is riddled with discussions of lobbying and legislation and trying to influence the way tobacco was treated politically.

It expressly discusses legislative

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=998
Page 4130 activities.  I can't � I don't understand why

counsel would do that after the last sidebar.  I

can hand you a copy up.

MR. GDANSKI: Your Honor asked at the last sidebar:  Is this document in evidence?

So now I'm putting their words, not Dr. Proctor's, their words, statements from party opponents, into evidence.

This document comes into evidence all the time.  It was admitted, Judge, in the underlying Engle case.

So there's no good-faith basis to keep it out of evidence in this case.  It's admitted in Engle without any kind of redaction or any kind of issue.

The case law says that we pick up right where the Engle litigation left off.  We get the benefit of the Engle evidentiary record.

We get the benefit of those findings. Mr. Shulman has every right to put in any Engle evidentiary exhibit into evidence.

And this document is of pivotal importance when it comes to the fraud and the conspiracy because it's their words looking back at what they did, which fronts or which � you

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=999
Page 4131 know, which parts of society they impacted and how

successful it was.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor �

MR. GDANSKI:  There's absolutely no reason to keep it out.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor has been very clear that in order to introduce notice of legislative activity, you have told the plaintiffs that they must provide a predicate that includes specific facts and examples of the legislative activities that contain lies and legislation in there.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, it would be � in an Engle progeny case, I would submit to the Court that it would be impermissible error to refuse the admission of documents that came in in the earlier Engle trial.

You can't reconcile an Engle progeny trial with the exclusion of Engle evidence.  This is their words.  This is their statements.  This is their document about what they did.  It's not anything other than that.

They can't �

THE COURT:  Move on to something else, and we'll take this up later on a � on a recess

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1000
Page 4132 after I've had a chance to look at it.  All right?

Move on to something else.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  When it came to the defense of litigation-related claims, lawsuits by smokers or their families, was the tobacco industry's defense of those lawsuits part of their campaign of doubt, their holding strategy?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's part of the conspiracy.

MR. FURR:  We need to approach again.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Mr. Gdanski is asking the question that defending individual lawsuits by a smoker or their family is a fraud, that it's part of the conspiracy.

In other words, that what I'm doing here right now is fraudulent and part of the conspiracy.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to sustain the objection.

I asked a historical-based question �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor �

MR. GDANSKI:  � not that.  So they should tell Your Honor that before they get up here and object.

MR. FURR:  The order � Your Honor, the issue that the Court addressed in 19a is, was if they can show that something was being fraudulently done in the defense of prior lawsuits, you're going to allow them to introduce

defending a lawsuit in this case �

THE COURT:  Right.  I agree.  This question does suggest that.  So the question is sustained.

It has t be rephrased.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase.

MR. FURR:  I'd ask that the Court give a corrective instruction to the jury.

MR. GDANSKI:  There was no answer.  It was just a question.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

(Two jurors left the courtroom at 10:39 a.m.)

THE BAILIFF:  We need to hold off a second.  We've lost two jurors.

(Two jurors entered the courtroom at 10:39 a.m.)

MR. GDANSKI:  May I proceed, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, following up on the last question, as part of the historical context, can you explain � well, first can you

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1004
Page 4136 tell us whether or not, as part of the fraud of the tobacco companies, claims or the defense of litigation was in furtherance of that fraud?

A.  Yes, that was part of it. Q.  Now can you explain that, please, for this jury, how the defense of litigation during the conspiracy where smokers or loved ones would sue tobacco companies, how that was part of the historical fraud?

MR. FURR:  Same objection. MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor ruled on this exactly.

THE COURT:  There shouldn't be any comments.

Okay.  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Go ahead, sir. A.  Well, there were various pillars of the conspiracy, and litigation was one of those.

And, you know, right after '54, people started filing suits, claiming they'd been harmed by smoking.

And this was obviously a concern, and it was something that the industry worked very hard on making, you know, neutral.

Q.  Were they successful at doing that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1005
Page 4137 A.  Very.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Go ahead, sir. A.  Yes, they were very successful defending cigarettes as a wholesome product in front of juries.

Q.  And so what is it in the historical context, why is it significant that the industry viewed the litigation as a threat and needed to employ a fraud in order to succeed?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

Can we approach, Your Honor?

MR. BRENNER:  And relevance.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  My objection is leading. Argumentative.  I know Mr. Gdanski very much wants to argue to the jury the fact that we're here defending this lawsuit is a fraud, but you've told him that he can't in no uncertain terms.

MR. GDANSKI:  I have not done any such

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1006
Page 413: thing.

MR. FURR:  I'm not done yet.

The question just asked baldly asked the

witness to agree with Mr. Gdanski's leading

question.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to

sustain the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase.

THE COURT:  All right.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, during

the course of the conspiracy, did the industry

view the threat of litigation as an existential

threat?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And so why, what's the historical

significance?  We already talked about how they,

as part of their fraud, defended the litigation,

right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So what's the importance of � in light

of knowing that they defended it as part of the

fraud, what's the importance of knowing that they

viewed the threat of litigation as an existential

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1007
Page 4139 threat?

And what does an existential threat even mean?

A.  Well, it just means a threat to their very existence as an industry.  Their continued ability to sell cigarettes depended on their success in this, you know, what I've called their general war on the truth, and litigation was simply one of many fronts in that war.

Q.  And, Dr. Proctor, to wrap this up for this moment in time, were they successful in doing that?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Your Honor, I'd like to approach again.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll withdraw the question.  Okay.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, have you examined, as part of your historical research, the different ways and impacts that litigation by smokers had against the tobacco companies and had on public change?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And did the tobacco industry � as part of their fraud, as part of their conspiracy, were they able to affect and make sure that the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1008
Page 4140 litigation did not overcome the tobacco industry?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Relevance.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  During the course of the conspiracy, Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco industry control the litigation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, they certainly tried to.

Q.  (By MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  And is it part of the concept that they defined and described as a holding strategy?

A.  Yes, that was one of the terms they gave for the entire conspiracy.

Q.  Yes, sir.  All right.  Back to science. We got off subject a little bit.

Science, and you were talking about the way in which the industry paid for scientific research to be done by third parties.

I want to talk to you about something called White Papers.  Okay? A.  Yes. Q.  Tell the jury, please, what are White

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1009
Page 4141 Papers?

A.  The TIRC, and later the Tobacco Institute, issued what they called White Papers, which were compendia of opinions by scientists saying they didn't think smoking caused cancer.

Q.  So �

A.  And these continued on for decades.

Q.  And why, why was it important for these impressions and conclusions that smoking didn't cause cancer to come from, quote, unquote, scientific perspectives?

A.  Well, there was recognition of a confidence problem in the industry's own statements.

If they said:  We don't think it caused cancer, maybe people would believe them; maybe they wouldn't.

But if they could have scholars who looked like they were independent scientists making these same claims, they would have a lot more credibility.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have some examples of the White Papers, PT2900, 2623, 2602, and 3279. We move each of those, those four into evidence, please.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1010
Page 4142 MR. FURR:  I have an objection to 3279.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So we'll admit 2 900, 2623, and 2602 into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit Nos. PT2900, 2623 and 2 602 were received in evidence.)

THE COURT:  3279 will either have to be addressed on the break unless you guys need a sidebar on it now.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let me clarify. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  These White Papers, they all come from the Tobacco Institute?

A.  Or its forerunner, the TIRC.  The TIRC is the forerunner that sprouts off the TI in 1958.

Q.  And so to what type of distribution � that was bad.  I messed up the question.

What type of distribution did these White Papers have?

A.  They were distributed in hundreds of thousands of copies to the media, people in Washington, you know, just people throughout the country who were influential.

Q.  Okay.  So fair to say the Tobacco Institute or the tobacco companies wanted as many people to see these when they put them out as

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1011
Page 4143 possible?

A.  Especially powerful people.

Q.  Powerful people, influential people?

A.  These White Papers are not really distributed as much to the general public as to opinion leaders and people of great power.

Q.  So if you had power, the institute and the industry wanted you to see them? A.  Yes, that was this purpose.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's an objection to one?

MR. FURR:  Yes, 3209 � excuse me, 3279.

MR. GDANSKI:  How about the demonstrative, 05?

MR. FURR:  I have no objection to the use of the demonstrative as long as this is not --

MR. BRENNER:  Which demonstrative?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just EEM05.

MR. PHILIPSON:  The one on your screen.

MR. FURR:  No objection to the use of the demonstrative, Your Honor.  I will maintain my objection to the one underlying document.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's just go ahead and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1012
Page 4144 put up the demonstrative, please?

THE COURT:  All right. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So Mr. Furr is objecting to 3279:  The Cigarette Controversy: Why More Research is Needed.

This was a document publicly distributed by the Tobacco Institute in 1984 to powerful people who needed to see it to learn what �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach, Your Honor?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  � the tobacco industry wanted to say?

MR. FURR:  I'd like to approach.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. GDANSKI:  I assume you want a redaction, right?

MR. FURR:  This game of attempting to cutely flaunt your order should be stopped.  This is a document that is a summary of legislative activities.

The information that is in �

THE COURT:  Is this the same one we talked about before?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1013
Page 4145 MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. FURR:  No, it's another one.  It's yet another one, and he's now substituting the code for influencing powerful people, as though there's anybody in the room who does not understand what that's a code for.

It's an improper end-run around your ruling.  Mr. Gdanski knows this is a document that summarizes information that was provided in various legislative activities, and he shouldn't be playing this game in front of the jury.

MR. GDANSKI:  Honestly, I have no idea what counsel is talking about.  I asked if they had any objection to Demonstrative 05.

They said:  No.

The knew the title was on there.  They knew every single thing that I just said was on there.

I don't know what's going on.

I said:  Do you have an objection to Demonstrative 05?

They could have said:  Yes, we do because it has a picture of one of the documents that we object to.

They said:  No.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1014
Page 4146 So I proceeded.  I mean how do you �

THE COURT:  Do you change your position on the demonstrative?

MR. FURR:  Well, if he's going to flaunt the order �

MR. GDANSKI:  I have flaunted nothing.

MR. FURR: � to the jury on what the document is, yes, I change my position.

I had no idea he was going to use it �

THE COURT:  All right.  So let's not use the demonstrative at this point.

MR. GDANSKI:  And I just want to go on the record, I don't accept Judge Furr's representation that I violated any kind of order.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I don't think there is anybody else referred to as "Judge" except for me right now �

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, of course.

THE COURT:  � first of all.  So I don't think we should be referring to opposing counsel as a judge.

Secondly, I believe that I've made it very clear that there should be no reference to anything that could be referred to as lobbying or

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1015
Page 4147 influencing legislation until we've had a chance

to resolve that later.

So there should be no further references to that, and we will not use this demonstrative at this time.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll just � I'll just block out � I'll have them like � what's it called where you black something else?

MR. BRENNER:  Redact.

MR. GDANSKI:  Redact.

I'll have him redact � yes, thank you.

I'll have him redact that little section on the demonstrative so I can use it without it. Okay?

THE COURT:  Any objection to that?

MR. FURR:  No objection to that.

But I would also ask, Your Honor, that counsel be instructed that the ruling extends to this phrase of:  Influencing powerful people in Washington.

I mean what else �

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  I will not do Washington, yes.

Powerful people, I don't agree.  But I'11 stay away from Washington for now until we

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1016
Page 414 resolve this issue, yes, sir.  I understand.

MR. FURR:  It's been done multiple times already.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right. THE COURT:  Okay? MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.  Thank you. (The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So we're going to show the same demonstrative, but now we're going to redact, we're going to erase from the screen the section of the one defense objects to.

So � all right.  You have these four here.  Just tell the jury what they are and what we're looking at, please.

A.  These are some of the White Papers that were produced by the Tobacco Institute or its forerunner, the TIRC.

Q.  And this goes just � it's multidecade, '54, '78, and '79.  These had an impact; they were important?

A.  They did.

Q.  Did the industry also measure internally the effect of their public relations campaign? A.  They did.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1017

	Page 4149


	MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  PT3694.  We

move
	that into evidence.


	MR. BRENNER:  Number again, Mr. Gdanski?


	MR. GDANSKI:  3 6 94.


	MR. FURR:  No objection.


	THE COURT:  Okay.  So that's admitted

into
	evidence without objection.


	(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT3694 was

received in evidence.)
	

	Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And moving forward

also,
	, did the industry understand that without the

TIRC,
	, so the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,

they
	would have been in a deplorable position?


	A.  Yes.


	Q.  Does that come from their own documents?


	A.  It does.


	MR. GDANSKI:  1608, PT1608, we move that

into
	evidence.  It's a letter to Paul Hahn.


	MR. FURR:  No objection.


	Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Let's take a look at

it, please.
	

	THE COURT:  Okay.  So that's admitted

into
	evidence without objection.


	MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.


	(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT1608 was

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1018
Page 4150 received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  This is from E.A. Darr

at Reynolds to Paul Hahn.

Who was E.A. Darr?

A.  E.A. Darr was president of Reynolds, and he was writing to Paul Hahn, president of American.

Q.  Now the Tobacco Institute Research Committee, they're a component, a major component of the conspiracy, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What was their stated public role?  In other words, how did the public perceive them?

A.  Well, they were stated to be an honest effort to get at the root of the question whether cigarettes caused cancer.

Q.  This is an internal correspondence between two tobacco company executives?

A.  It is.

Q.  It's a private document, not a public one?

A.  Correct.

Q.  All right.  It says:  You took a bold and courageous action in December �

That's when they met at the Plaza Hotel?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1019
Page 4151 A.  That's right.

Q.  � when you called for a meeting of

manufacturers to discuss ways and means of

presenting a united front.

And they did that, right?

A.  They did.

Q.  The next paragraph, it says:  The cigarette industry by now would have been in a deplorable position if they had not met. Right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And at the bottom, it says:  In other words, TIRC has been a successful defensive operation.

This is only 1957?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How did they already know, between 1955 and 1957, they were successful, it was working?

A.  Well, the confidence had been restored. Cigarette consumption was growing again.

Q.  Publicly though, did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee sponsor good research?

A.  Well, thousands of peer-reviewed published articles, and certainly good for the researchers but off topic and part of a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1020
Page 4152 conspiracy.

So it's what I sometimes call micro good and macro bad.

Q.  What does that mean, micro good, macro bad?

A.  Well, you can look at any one article, and it's a fine article about urology or genetics or something else.

But taken as an assemblage, it's a massive distraction campaign.

So it's a perfect example where you can't really see the truth by looking at any one article.

Q.  I guess the question is this:  As it relates to the stated purpose of looking into whether or not smoking cigarettes causes disease and injury as it relates to, you know, the stated purpose, did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee sponsor a lot of meaningful, well-researched science on that subject?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No, there's only a handful, out of the 7,000 articles that came out of this project, peer-reviewed, scientific

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1021
Page 4153 articles, only a handful that touch on the

question of smoking causing actual harm.

And the policy, in several instances of those, was actually to cut off the research funding if that occurred.

I call it leakage.  It's not a perfect conspiracy.  There's leakage.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was the stated purpose of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee essentially false and a lie?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was the stated purpose of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee truthful?

A.  No, it's dishonest.  It was � it had a professed purpose and an actual purpose, and those were very different.

Q.  And was the professed purpose what we now know to be an untruthful lie?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative and cumulative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. GDANSKI:  PT3081, we move that into evidence.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1022
Page 4154 MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  It will be admitted into

evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT3081 was

received in evidence.)

Q. (BY MR. GDANSKI) I'll just put it up for a second.

By the way, you mentioned they sponsored research.  Some of it won Nobel prizes?

A. Yes, ten Nobel prizes came out of the CTR research, none of which had anything to do with tobacco.

Q.  Did they sponsor research at fantastic universities?

A.  Every university in the country, yeah, that was prestigious.

Q.  Was it a Nobel prize for looking into nicotine being addictive or smoking causing disease?

A.  No.

Q. Okay. And they sponsored research at Stanford, I think, right?

A.  They did, at least 22 grants, I think, to different professors.

Q.  This is a newspaper article where the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1023
Page 4155 cigarette company says:  The health scare is receding.  The cigarette industry is strong and is showing good growth.  The health scare is receding.  The worst is over. Right? A.  Right.

Q.  That's what they were telling the public; that's what they were trying to convince people of?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT2197. MR. BRENNER:  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  It will we admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2197 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  One of the things you mentioned, Dr. Proctor, was something called leakage.

Do you remember that? A.  Yes.

Q.  What would happen in the tobacco industry when there was the occasional reference of � the occasional example of leakage where

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1024
Page 4156 somebody would be doing a scientific study that might link smoking to cancer, what would take place?

A.  Well, there's several examples where if the researcher funded by the TIRC actually found some harm from smoking, their research would be cut off.

Q.  And were there also examples where research was done inside the company, not funded research but private company research, where if somebody was looking into a subject matter, was doing experiments with mice and the company was, you know, saying:  We're not happy with that kind of research, they would respond?

A.  Yes, Yes.  There are several examples of that.

Q.  Tell the jury about some of the examples, please.

A.  Well, in 1970, a whole team of RJ Reynolds researchers was fired when they identified a mouse mechanism for emphysema, smoking causing emphysema, several dozen scientists were fired.

Other examples were �

Q.  What did they do with the experiment?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1025
Page 4157 A.  Pardon me?

Q.  What happened with the experiment?

A.  They killed all the mice, they shut the lab overnight.  It's called the mouse house massacre.

Q.  What was the other examples you were about �

A.  There are many examples.

Victor DeNoble was doing research on the addictive potency of nicotine working synergistically with acetaldehyde. And when he demonstrated self-administration of � with laboratory animals, which is the hallmark of addiction in the '80s, his lab was also closed, and he was � he was fired.

Q.  What does that tell us about the tobacco companies' efforts to keep what they knew, what they had access to from becoming public?

A.  Well, one of the biggest threats to the industry was the truth, and they didn't want the truth to come out.  They would prefer to suppress that science.

Q.  And, Dr. Proctor, you know, we're going to look at more documents.  We looked at years'

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1026
Page 415: worth of information.

Remind us, how many pages of documentary evidence are there that is available to tell the story?

A.  Over 80 million pages in the archives.

Q.  Can you tell it in a sound bite, or do you need to go through the documents as best as we can in the days that we have here?

A.  It's a substantial story.

Q.  Did the companies, in the late '50s and over the course of time, would they occasionally have instances in which they would meet or scientists would travel to determine what the companies were researching and looking into on sort of, you know, each one at a different point in time?

A.  Yes, that's the genre of documents I called travel literature.  So American scientists from the industry would go over to Europe and interview the top scientists at the European tobacco companies.

European tobacco researchers would send their experts over to America and interview to find out the state of the art, the state of the litigation, things like that, anything that was of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1027
Page 4159 relevance to the whole smoking and disease

question.

Q.  And in the late '50s, one of the

paramount things that was relevant was, does

smoking cause disease, right?

A.  That was key.

Q.  So what happened?  What do you know about that story from what you've reviewed when there would be these visits from scientists from different companies to companies here to learn about the state of affairs?

A.  They were looking at which � what types of research are going on internally in the different companies, what types of research are being funded.  They would look at whether there was an agreement internally that smoking actually caused cancer.

And that's what a team of British researchers finds in 1958, was that the general view with �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is hearsay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained.  The jury should disregard the last answer given by the witness.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1028
Page 4160 Ask your next question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Were there visits � I'll walk you through it, Dr. Proctor.

Were there visits where scientists from tobacco companies, from overseas or from stateside tobacco companies would come to the other tobacco companies and look at the state of affairs and what the companies thought about the subject of smoking causing disease?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And in those visits, do we have a documentary paper trail of who was there and who was met with?

A.  An extensive paper trail.

Q.  Okay.  So we know which scientists from which universities or which tobacco companies the investigating scientists met with?

A.  We do.

Q. All right. Do we know that we met with individuals from these companies, the defendants in this case?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And we know that they discussed the subject of smoking causing disease?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1029
Page 4161 A.  Yes, and whether this was understood.

Q.  Okay.  And remind us, this is 1958, when

tobacco companies are publicly claiming smoking

does not cause disease, right?

A.  Well, they're usually phrasing it as: There's no evidence that it does, that the evidence is not reliable.  We need more research.

Q.  Right.

And do we know from the documentary evidence, public � do we know from documents which are publicly available right now for anyone to see as to what the scientists from overseas learned when they came to these defendants in 1958 and said:  Hey, what do you guys really think about smoking causing disease?

A.  We do.  That's a matter of public archival record now.

Q.  And in trying to determine, as opposed to the public statement, in trying to determine privately what the industry knew in 1958 based on internal data about smoking causing disease, are these traveling documents, these trip report documents an excellent source of information?

A.  They're crucial, yeah, they're very

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1030
Page 4162 useful to understand what was really going on.

Q.  So do you know from reviewing these

documents what the industry's position was

internally in 1958 about smoking causing

disease?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what was it based on these documents?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's the same hearsay, Your Honor.  We need to approach.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  What Mr. Gdanski is doing now is asking Dr. Proctor to repeat what British scientists, who did not work for these defendants, stated about what they think that scientists who did work for the defendants stated.

In other words, it's hearsay.  He's asking him to repeat statements made by scientists who did not work for a party in this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not hearsay.  It's not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the document.  I could care less �

THE COURT:  What's it being offered for then?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1031
Page 4163 MR. GDANSKI:  It's being offered to

prove notice, notice that the tobacco companies

had regarding smoking causing disease.

I recall an extensive discussion yesterday, on something that's coming in to prove notice, you can offer a hearsay statement.  For example, a conversation between a deceased son and a dentist.

THE COURT:  What year were these?

MR. GDANSKI: This is 1958. This document was admitted in Engle. It's Engle evidence, Exhibit 3312.

It goes in to prove the fact that in 1958, while the tobacco companies were saying smoking doesn't cause disease, they internally were saying smoking does cause disease.

Not that it actually did or doesn't. The point of whether it does cause or cause mechanism, whatever the scientific basis of the document says or establishes is not really important.

The point is notice.  The tobacco companies were noticed internally smoking caused disease in 1958.

THE COURT:  Well, you guys didn't make

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1032
Page 4164 that argument yesterday.

MR. FURR:  We did, and of course things can be used for notice for non-hearsay purposes, but that's not what this is.

This is a statement by British scientists about what they claim the tobacco company scientists said.

How is that notice to us?

MR. GDANSKI:  How was it notice yesterday when it was a statement by a dentist about what a deceased son's conversation with him had?

They used � it's goose/gander straight, Judge.  They used this yesterday.

And at these meetings, by the way �

THE COURT:  Let's talk about this.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

I can prove at these meetings, individuals from these tobacco companies were there if Your Honor �

THE COURT:  Well, what were they being put on notice of?

MR. GDANSKI:  Being put on notice of the question whether or not they believed smoking caused disease.  So it goes --

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1033
Page 4165 THE COURT:  It's not whether or not they

believed it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Whether or not �

THE COURT:  I'm assuming they did believe it did cause a disease?

MR. GDANSKI:  Whether or not � there was a link between smoking causing disease. Belief doesn't matter for purposes of this conversation.

So there's a question in this case of what the tobacco companies knew and when they knew it.  That's my question.

Their question is what Mr. Shulman knew and when he knew it.

In order to prove my claim of what they knew, the notice that they had and when they knew it, I'm using this hearsay document.

They used a hearsay document to prove what Shulman knew and when he knew it.

THE COURT:  Isn't the conspiracy already an Engle finding?  What's the issue � what's the � what more do you need to prove?

MR. GDANSKI:  You're asking me?

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm allowed to put on the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1034
Page 4166 evidence of the conspiracy.  I don't just start

the finding and rest my case.  That's what we're

doing with this witness for three days.

And I can prove, Judge � I have a piece of paper right here � that it's not just British scientists saying so.

They met with someone from Philip Morris, Reynolds, and they met with someone from Lorillard.  They met with someone from the different tobacco companies.

So this is how I prove that the tobacco companies internally, through their scientists, despite the fact that their CEOs were saying it doesn't cause disease, their scientists were on notice that smoking cigarettes causes disease.

It can't be � it's fundamentally unfair and prejudicial to the plaintiff for the notice rule only to work in the plaintiff's detriment and not in the same way to the defendant.

THE COURT:  Response?

MR. FURR:  How would a document demonstrate notice when the document is being used to show you what you said?

In other words, if I said something today �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1035
Page 4167 THE COURT:  Well, what exactly does the

document show?  What exactly is going to come into

evidence so that I know whether it goes to notice

or not?

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

MR. FURR:  So the point is, if I said something today and Mr. Guest went home and wrote it down, how could that be introduced in a later case to put me on notice of what I said?

I already know what I said.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, this came in in Engle, Exhibit 3312.  It's unfair and error to �

THE COURT:  So they're saying the notice is that they were � that the tobacco companies were put on notice that it causes lung cancer?

(Witness approaches the sidebar and confers with Mr. Gdanski.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor needs to use the restroom.

THE COURT:  Sure, but that's going to then throw off � we're probably going to end up with a longer recess and push us pretty close to the lunch hour, but go ahead and go.

(Witness leaves the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  All right.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1036
Page 416: MR. GDANSKI:  It's straight notice.  I

mean, I think it's under Douglas which says we

pick up � pick up where Engle left off.

It would be error to not permit us to use Engle evidence, but here we have just a clear, clear, legal basis for the introduction of the document.

And, you know, I'd remind the Court, we objected yesterday when they made the notice argument.

And Your Honor said:  No.  I see the case law that they handed that it can go to notice.

This is the documentary piece of evidence that says:  Hey, you guys were on notice of something internally which you were denying publicly.

So it's not the example that Mr. Furr gave.

THE COURT:  So I guess it's notice as to the causation of lung cancer?

MR. GDANSKI:  Exactly.

MR. FURR:  I think that's where � of course we recognize that notice is a viable exception to the hearsay rule.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

MR. FURR:  I understand.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.

I'll just wait for Dr. Proctor.

THE COURT:  Getting all these people back in the room, it's not that easy.

MR. GDANSKI:  Understood.

Are we breaking by noon?

THE COURT:  We're going to break by noon, maybe a few minutes before noon.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  Thank you.

MR. FURR:  How long for the lunch break?

THE COURT:  Probably just � today is just maybe an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes, something like that.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  Thank you.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

THE COURT:  While we're waiting for the witness to return, was there an exhibit, I think?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's 3289, Exhibit PT3289.

THE COURT:  Is that the one that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

Page 4171 Mr. Brenner said that was resolved?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, no, no.  We'll deal

with that at a separate � he just didn't get �

THE COURT:  Oh, okay.

(Witness enters the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  All right.  The witness is

back now.

MR. GDANSKI:  So right now, on the

record, we're moving 3289 into evidence.  Your

Honor has just addressed that issue.

(Witness takes the stand.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  So that will be

admitted over objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT3289 was

received in evidence.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  You can ask your next

question.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  All right.  Well,

let's take a look, please?

MR. GDANSKI:  Pull that up, Rob.

MR. PHILIPSON:  It's coming up.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So this is a report on

a visit to USA and Canada, 17th April through 12th

May, 1958, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1040
Page 4172 A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 2, please.

Do we have the itinerary from the

British scientists of what they did, where they

went, and who they met with?

A.  Yes.

Q. It's American Tobacco Company, Philip Morris. They went to Duke University, several colleges.  They went to A.D. Little.

What's the A.D. Little, Inc.?

A.  Arthur D. Little was an organization doing contract research, especially animal experiments for the Liggett Company.

Q.  So Arthur D. Little was a research company doing contract research for Liggett?

A.  Yes, on cancer-causing agents in smoke.

Q.  And do we know from their evidence, from their records what Arthur D. Little concluded while working for Liggett?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What do we know?

A.  Well, that there were, in fact, carcinogens in smoke, cancer-causing agents.

Q.  And did they inform Liggett of that?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1041
Page 4173 A.  They did.

Q.  Did Liggett then, after they had that knowledge from Arthur D. Little that there's cancer-causing agents in cigarettes, did they come forward and say:  Okay.  You've got us.  Cancer is in cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.  What year was that?  We have the document, but what year was that?

A.  It was in the early 1960s, but they had started doing contract work throughout the '50s.

Q.  Very good.

These scientists met with TIRC, and they had multiple meetings with the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go to Page Number 3.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  It says:  Causation � MR. PHILIPSON:  Give me a sec. MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Causation of lung cancer, with one exception (HSN Greene), the individuals whom we met believed that smoking causes lung cancer, if by "causation" we mean any chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1042
Page 4174 and which involves smoking as an indispensable link.

Do you see that? A.  Yes.

Q.  So this is 1958.  Publicly they're telling people smoking has not been proven to cause cancer, right?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Publicly what are they saying about smoking causing cancer? A.  That it does not.

Q.  Internally, privately, what do we know they're saying about smoking causing cancer?

A.  That almost everyone knew it did cause cancer.

Q.  And it says:  With one exception, (HSN Green).

Who was � oh, no, it says:  In the USA, only Berkson apparently is now prepared to doubt the statistical evidence, and his reasoning is nowhere thought to be sound.

So there's one guy in the United States, one scientist they met with who is prepared to

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1043
Page 4175 doubt the statistical evidence, but his reasoning is not thought to be sound, right?

A.  Yes, Joseph Berkson.

Q.  Who was Joseph Berkson?

A.  He was a statistician who did not believe that smoking caused cancer.

Q.  And what � after these � after it was determined that there was a guy who no one thinks to be of sound judgment, what did the industry do with Mr. Berkson?

A.  They hired him.  He becomes one of their early special projects operatives to attack the evidence.

Q.  Was the tobacco industry looking to warn people of the truth?

A.  No, they were fighting the truth at every opportunity.

MR. GDANSKI:  We looked at some polling data last week, PT32 95A.  And we move that into evidence, 3295A.

MR. BRENNER:  95A?

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just 3295A.  It's a study of � it's a poll from 1959.

MR. BRENNER:  I don't have the whole thing.  Perhaps you can show us on the screen what

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1044
Page 4176 you want to use, and we can deal with the exhibit

later.  I don't have that exhibit number.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll come back to it.

Did you put it on the screen?

MR. PHILIPSON:  What page do you want to

use?

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll come back to it.

It's not � I'd rather just move it along.  So

write down 32 95A, and we'll deal with that.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Do you know who Alan

Rodgman was?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Who was Alan Rodgman, R-O-D-G-M-A-N?

Who was he?

A.  He was a chemist hired in 1954 to study

the detailed composition of smoke.  He was an

analytic chemist.

Following Teague's survey of cancer

research, Rodgman used advanced analytic chemical

methods to identify all the known components in

smoke.

And he identified over a dozen different

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cancer-causing

substances in smoke from 1954 to 1962.

Q.  And he published � or he wrote this in

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

	Page 4177

a document in

	A.
	Yes.
	
	


	Q.

	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	We'd move it into

	THE
	COURT:
	Okay.  So which one is the

one
	that
	's moved into
		evidence without objection,

2141
	?
	
	
	

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1046
Page 417 MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  So 2141 is

admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2141 was

received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So this is "Optimum Composition of Tobacco and its Smoke."

And you said he identified some 30-odd polycyclic hydrocarbons characterized in the lab?

A.  Yes, he did.

Q.  What's a polycyclic hydrocarbon?

A.  These are ring structures, benzene-related ring structured molecules which had been earlier identified as carcinogens in an occupational context.

Mainly people working in the petro-chemical industry had been found to get skin tumors, bladder tumors, other types of tumors as a result of exposure to these chemicals, and then they're later found in tobacco smoke.

Q.  Now certainly by this time, there was medical literature that identified cancer-causing agents in cigarette smoke, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So is there anything about this that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1047
Page 4179 was, you know, secret as far as scientific knowledge?

A.  Well, it's only secret in a sense that some of these chemicals were first identified by Reynolds.

Cholanthrene, for example, was first identified by Reynolds, but these things are eventually published, and that's really not the essence of the fraud.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 3.

I mean, the essence of the fraud wasn't that there's no carcinogens in cigarettes.

The essence of the fraud was that carcinogens in cigarettes aren't proven to cause cancer in humans?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  When you say "it's not the essence of the fraud," what was the essence of the fraud as it relates to medicine in cancer?

A.  Well, it was to deny any harm publicly. There were admissions that there were mouse � sometimes called mouse carcinogens in smoke.

It was often said they did not have a relationship to human cancer.  So the fraud is

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1048
Page 4180 just the denial and concealment of the overall

fact that cigarettes were causing death.

Q.  It says here:  What is the optimum composition of cigarette smoke with respect to these factors?

And then it describes that cigarettes should possess satisfactory flavor to please the consumer and should contain sufficient nicotine to supply the necessary requirements of the smoker with respect to this compound. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  Drop down.

It says:  Should yield nicotine in the smoke in an amount ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 milligrams per cigarette.

Did they do that?

A.  They did that and many other things.

Q.  And have there many cigarettes, Dr. Proctor, that were made that had such low levels of nicotine that they would not cause addiction or sustain addiction?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What happened to those cigarettes?

A.  Well, they did not do well in the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1049
Page 4181 marketplace.  They were not advertised honestly.

The manufacturers could not say these

don't cause addiction because they weren't

admitting that any cigarettes cause addiction.

So they're kind of caught in a double

bind with the conspiracy, and they were limited by

the conspiracy as to what they could actually tell

the public.

Q.  What does it tell the public health community about why smokers smoke if nobody smoked a cigarette that did not contain nicotine?

A.  Well, smokers mostly smoked because they're addicted.  Most smokers are addicted.

The ones that are not � cannot create and sustain an addiction will not be purchased so long as there are other available ones to buy that do have nicotine.

Q.  And on that subject, has there ever been a point in time where the tobacco industry only marketed and sold cigarettes that could not sustain addiction because they did not have sufficient nicotine to keep a smoker hooked?

A.  No, that's the key point.  They've always went � when they have sold nonaddictive cigarettes, they've always been, A, they wouldn't

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1050
Page 4182 say they're not addictive, and, B, they would not

take the addictive ones off the market.

Q.  Okay.  And the last point about this, it

says:  The physiological �

That's what we talked about last week

with Dr. Teague; that's the addictive stage of the

smoking behaviors?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.

The physiological requirements of the

smoker with respect to nicotine can be met by the

application of the optimum amount of nicotine to

the extracted tobacco.

You discussed some of that, and we're

prepared to show a video later that describes that

process?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did Dr. Rodgman also look at the

evidence available linking smoking to disease?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT3709.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  This is admitted into

evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT3709 was received

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1051
Page 4183 in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And did the industry know that the amount � as late as 1959, the amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard was overwhelming and the amount of evidence challenging such an indictment � which is their position � was scant?

A.  That quote you just gave is from 1962.

Q.  '62.  Okay.

Did they know it in '62?

A.  And yes.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  Is that in this document?

A.  It is.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go to Page 7.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So that's what it says:  Obviously the amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an indictment is scant.

This is '62, you said?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  So at any point � let me just wrap up the 1950s and get out of that decade. In the 1950s, at any point in time, did

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1052
Page 4184 the tobacco companies come forward and say smoking cigarettes causes any disease or is addictive?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's cumulative.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's about the whole decade.

THE COURT:  Hang on.

Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No, at no point did they do that.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  You mentioned Arthur D. Little, and I'd like to look at a couple documents from that entity.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT2138.

MS. RUIZ:  No objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Excuse me, what's the number?

MR. GDANSKI:  2138.  It's a Liggett-related document.

So we move that into evidence, 2138.

THE COURT:  No objection?

MS. RUIZ:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  So this will be admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT2138 was received

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1053
Page 4185 in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So we just looked at

Rodgman from 1962 from Reynolds.  This is now

Arthur D. Little for Liggett, 1961.  Let's take a

look.

At the top, it says Arthur D. Little,

Inc., March 15, 1961.

There are biologically � L&M, A

Perspective Review.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes, Liggett & Myers.

Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

There are biologically active materials

present in cigarette tobacco.  These are cancer

causing, cancer promoting, poisonous, stimulating,

pleasurable, and flavorful.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  So at this time, again,

1961, Liggett is part of the conspiracy?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  When did they join?

A.  Well, they sort of joined off and on.

They were not in the original four years of the

conspiracy, but they joined with the founding of

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1054
Page 4186 the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  After this document is provided from the research company, Arthur D. Little, to Liggett, does Liggett abandon the conspiracy and publicly accept that smoking causes cancer, promotes cancer, is poisonous, is stimulating, is pleasurable and flavorful?

A.  No.

Q.  Anything prevent them from doing that?

A.  No.

Q.  Would that � I mean would a break-off, if Liggett would have broken away from the conspiracy in 1961 and says:  Hey, you guys are lying.  We now know the truth, and we're exposing it all, would that have made a difference?

A.  It would have made a big difference.

Q.  And could they have easily done that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  They did it 40 years too late, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  PT1989, from Liggett, which also discusses the years lost based on cigarette smoking?

A.  Yes.

Page 41 MS. RUIZ:  I'm sorry.  I'm losing my

voice.

It's entitled Comparison of Smoking and Fatal Motor Vehicle Accidents as a Public Hazard.

Under Rule 403, this document is highly prejudicial and of minimal probative value, if any.

He's already talked about Liggett's participation in the conspiracy.  It was already talked about.

This conjecture of Comparison of Smoking and Fatal Motor Vehicle Accidents � its whole purpose is to cause unduly prejudicial evidence to come in.

This document has previously been excluded in other cases.  In trial it was excluded.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't remember that, but I think it is obviously relevant.  This is a company that's denying smoking wipes a year off your life.  It doesn't do anything to make your life shorter or cause any disease.

And internally, they have their scientists telling them that it takes �

THE COURT:  Is there a way you can just

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1057
Page 4189 read that, the one that's comparing the fatal

motor vehicle accident �

MR. GDANSKI:  To be honest with you, Judge, that would be impossible.  That's the whole point.

In other words, they're saying:  Hey, everyone is scared of car accidents, but, you know, car accidents are a minor concern.

THE COURT:  Well, but this isn't about car accidents.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

THE COURT:  So I'm going to find that it's minimally irrelevant and it's outweighed by the prejudice that could be � result in the confusion and it could be resulted by it, and it's also � it's also getting to be cumulative at this point.

MR. GDANSKI:  Here's what I can do:  I can � now that I look at the document upside-down, I can take out the portions dealing with the motor vehicle accidents and just talk about the effect that smoking has, and then there's no prejudice at all.

MS. RUIZ:  Your Honor �

MR. GDANSKI:  That was the whole

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1058
Page 4190 argument.

MS. RUIZ:  Your Honor, the comparison �

THE COURT:  Well, I first asked that question before I ruled, and you said it was impossible to do.

MR. GDANSKI:  I mean it � you know, it's �

THE COURT:  So  I already ruled.  Let's go.  Let's move on.  Let's go.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, on the scope of how cancer relates to morbidity and mortality, has the public health community researched that?

A.  Extensively.

Q.  And what do we know about that? A.  Well, cigarettes cause many more deaths than traffic accidents.  Traffic accidents go up �

MS. RUIZ:  Objection, Your Honor. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  I'm not asking about that.  I'm just � I'm not asking about that. I'm asking about sum total numbers.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1059
Page 4191 Forget comparisons for a second.

Just in sum total numbers, what percentage are we talking about?

A.  Percentage of what?

Q.  Deaths attributable to smoking.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Cumulative, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  I did not cover this.

MR. BRENNER:  We've gone over this with Dr. Proctor for days.

MR. GDANSKI:  I never asked this question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Cigarettes cause about one in five of all deaths in the United States, not just among smokers, but for the whole population.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Okay.  Thank you.

The Arthur D. Little was a private research company, right?

A.  Yes, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Q.  And did the other companies, did Philip Morris and Reynolds also use research companies to conduct research overseas or nationally?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1060
Page 4192 A.  They did.

Q.  All right.  Did Philip Morris use and

eventually acquire a company in Germany?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And can you tell the jury about that, please?

A.  It was called INBIFO, which is an acronym for Institute for Biological Research.  It was in Cologne, Germany, and it was purchased around 1969 to do certain types of research they did not want to do in the United States.

Q.  And do we have evidence and documents detailing the purchase of INBIFO, why it was purchased and what was done? A.  Yes. Q.  All right.  Let's take a look at �

MR. GDANSKI:  Move into evidence first PT2201.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection. Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So it's �

THE COURT:  So this is admitted into evidence without objection then?

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, Your Honor. MR. GDANSKI:  Yes. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT2201 was received

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1061
Page 4193 in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So this is Acquisition

of INBIFO, 1970.  This is � they've already

purchased the research lab there, right?

A.  Well, they're already doing research there.  They're in the process of purchasing.

Q.  Okay.  And it says on the bottom:  Since we have a major program at INBIFO and since this is a locale where we might do some of the things which we are reluctant to do in this country, I recommend that we acquire INBIFO either in toto or to the extent of controlling interest. Did they do that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why did they do that?

A.  Well, as I say, to do some of the more sensitive research they did not want to be discoverable in the United States.

Q.  And we talked earlier about the role that withholding research played as part of the fraud.

Did Philip Morris do research, withhold it as part of the fraud, in part because of the fear of its litigation implications?

A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1062
Page 4194 MR. BRENNER:  Object, Your Honor.

Relevance, and leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  What did you say besides relevance?  Did you say �

MR. BRENNER:  Relevance and leading.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll sustain it as leading.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Just tell the jury what role the suppression of research and the acquisition of overseas research facilities to do research that they were reluctant to do in this country, what relationship that had to keeping information secret from the American justice system.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Go ahead. A.  Well, they didn't want friendly research � they didn't want unfriendly research to see the light of day.

And if there were things that were sensitive, potentially embarrassing, they could do them over in Europe and it would be harder to find out about them for litigation and other purposes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1063
Page 4195 Q.  Does Philip Morris still have research facilities overseas?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And are the � is the research done by research facilities overseas today something that you could access at a snap?

A.  No, I don't think so.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT1592, we move that into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did � as part of the �

THE COURT:  So this is admitted into evidence without objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Thank you. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT1592 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  As part of the purchase and acquisition of INBIFO, the research facility in Germany, they say:  We have gone to great pains to eliminate any written contact with INBIFO, and I would like to maintain this structure.

Do you see that? A.  Yes.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1064
Page 4196 Q.  They also talk about having a dummy mailing address, right? A.  That's right.

Q.  It says:  If this procedure is unacceptable to you �

Well, you've got to explain what the procedure is.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's show the whole little paragraph there, just the second paragraph.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Therefore, I'm advising Jerry Osmalov to continue sending samples to what �

A.  To Neuchatel. Q.  Okay.

� for trans-shipment to INBIFO. And then they say:  If that procedure � the one that is just described � is unacceptable to you, perhaps we should consider a "dummy" mailing address in � A.   In Kdln. Q.  � Koln for the receipt of samples.

So they went through great pains to keep this private, right?

A.  Yes, cover their traces.

Q.  What's that?  Cover their traces.  Yes.

	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	Okay.  Go to 1051.  We

move that
	into evidence, PT1051.
		

	MR.
	BRENNER:
	Your Honor, I have an

objection
	to this document.
		

	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	You do?


	MR.
	BRENNER:
	I do have objections.


	THE
	COURT:
	Do you need to address them

at sidebar or
		wait?
	


	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	It deals specifically with

the subjet
	st of INBIFO,
		so it's not really

something
	that will ma
		Lke sense later on.


	THE
	COURT:
	Well, the answer is, do you

need to approach?
			


	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	It's not my objection.


	MR.
	BRENNER:
	I have an objection, Your

Honor.
	
	
	


	THE
	COURT:
	Well, it doesn't matter

whose obj(
	action it is,
		you'll both need to

approach.
	
	
	


	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	Yes, sir.  I'm coming.


	(The following discussion was held
		
sidebar:)
	
	
	


	MR.
	GDANSKI:
	You said you're going to

put us on
	the
	spot.
	


	THE
	COURT:
	Well, I asked you.  I said:

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1066
Page 419: Do you need to do it now?

Just don't start talking about, you know, what you need and what you don't need.  Just say:  Okay.  We need to approach.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I've given counsel some leeway on this INBIFO thing.  And at this point, he wants to start introducing just sort of random handwritten notes.

This one again says the same thing: Ship all documents to Cologne.

There's just no foundation.  This witness has a lot of � what this witness will do is he'11 just say � he's just going to speculate as to what was destroyed, which how he would ever know, I don't know.

And he isn't � he's happy to do this. He'll say:  Well, there's lots of things, you know, I know about this.

The only way for him to know what would be destroyed would be to tie this up � this is � for example, this study they're talking about, this is what was � as you've seen, Your Honor, it said this industry had a conspiracy to destroy documents.  It would probably be one of the most miserably conceived conspiracies ever.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1067
Page 4199 So I let him have some leeway on this

INBIFO thing, but then just to start bringing up

random documents, we have no idea what studies

they're talking about.  I think he's gone about as

far as he can go on this document.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not sure what the legal objection is.  The legal objection �

MR. BRENNER:  The legal objection is there's no relevance and no foundation for what I assume he'll just start saying when he's asking about the document.

MR. GDANSKI:  So there's clearly relevance because the subject �

MR. BRENNER:  The document itself, I just don't think he's laid a foundation to what they're talking about in the document.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll show it to him, and I'll lay the foundation.  It's not very complicated.

It says:  Ship all documents to Cologne, from Tom, Tom Osdene, to Philip Morris.

So, you know, this is very straightforward.  Cologne is Cologne.  Tom is Tom, and it comes from Philip Morris's files, and it has their Bates numbers on it.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1068
Page 4200 MR. BRENNER:  The "all" is what?  You

have no idea.  It's says "all."

THE COURT:  Well, you would have to ask him those predicate questions.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.  I'll do that. Can I keep this copy? MR. BRENNER:  You want the exhibit? MR. GDANSKI:  Well, I'm going to show it to him and ask him questions without putting it up.

Thank you.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, did you see evidence in documents from the Philip Morris USA records where they discussed actually shipping the documents to Cologne? A.  Yes.

Q.  And did you see the names of the scientists who you knew worked at the companies who did that? A.  Yes.

Q.  Did they do that?  Did they ship the documents to Cologne, Germany? A.  They did.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1069
Page 4201 Q.  I'm going to hand to you what we have and am asking to put into evidence as 10- � PT1051.

Does that establish that after purchasing the INBIFO facility, after discussing the idea of sending documents there, that they actually did ship the documents to Cologne, at the top?

A.  Well, this � not alone, but that's part of the whole piece of the puzzle. Q.  Right.

We couldn't show every document dealing with INBIFO, could we? A.  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  And so having established all that, we'd move this document into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  Same objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  It will be admitted into evidence over objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT1051 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Let's take a look.

At the top, it says exactly what you and I just discussed:  Ship all documents to Cologne,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1070
Page 4202 right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And it says:  By Tom?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Who is Tom?

A.  Tom Osdene, a researcher at Philip Morris.

Q.  And then on the bottom, Number 6, what's going on here?

A.  Well, it says:  If important letters or documents have to be sent, please send to home.  I will act on them and destroy.

Q.  And is this � we talked about this earlier.  Is this further evidence of the destruction of sensitive documents dealing with sensitive subjects from the tobacco companies' perspective?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did they destroy documents?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did they do it because they knew there were things in those documents which they didn't want anybody to see?

Q.
	(BY
	MR. GDANSKI)
	So as part of
	the
	

document
	, at
	the top, it says The Cancer
		
	

Controversy.
		
	
	
	


	Do
	you see that'
	p
	
	

A.
	Yes
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Was
	there in the
	public a controversy as
		
to whether or not smoking
			caused cancer?
	
	

A.
	Yes
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Was
	it a manufactured controversy?
			

A.
	It was.
		
	
	

Q.
	Who
	manufactured
	it?
	
	

A.
	The
	industry manufactured the
		
	

controversy.
		
	
	
	

Q.
	Who
	sold it?
	
	
	

A.
	The
	industry rea.
	Lly sold the doubt,
		the

controversy.
		
	
	
	

Q.
	Who
	manipulated it?
		
	

A.
	The
	industry.
	
	
	

Q.
	As part of this,
		it says Some
	
	

Definitions.
		So it defines carcinogen.
		You
	

already
	said
	� we don't need to read it.
		
	


	Carcinogen is a
		substance that
	causes
	
cancer?
	
	
	
	
	

A.
	Right.
		
	
	

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1074
Page 4206

Q.  They knew that much, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Okay.  It then lists, Page 12, a partial list of the carcinogens.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And are these all the carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

A.  No, it's a partial list.

Q.  So we know that Dr. Wakeham internally knows there are carcinogens, substances which cause cancer, and he identifies a partial but substantial list of carcinogens in cigarette smoke, right ?

A.  Yes.

Q. Then on Page 20, Dr. Wakeham discusses methods to reduce carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

And before we even get to that, just this concept of reduction of carcinogens in smoke, why is that important when it comes to what the tobacco companies did and said?

A. Well, they didn't like the fact it was causing cancer. There was a concern to make it cause less cancer.

Q.  So he says:  To achieve this

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1075
Page 4207 objective � the objective of reducing carcinogens, cancer-causing agents in smoke � we will � I'm sorry.

To achieve this objective will require a major research effort, because, 1, carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke.

Right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So they're in every compound. It's filled with carcinogens, right?

A.  Yeah.  There's not a clean part of smoke.  That's the crucial fact.  Earlier there had been a theory that maybe there was one or two or three carcinogens that could actually be taken out and cigarette smoke would be completely safe. That's a pretty common view in the '50s.

By this time, they're realizing since there are carcinogens in every part of the smoke, there's not a clean part that you could keep just by removing the arsenic or the benzpyrene or something else, and so that's the pickle that they're in.

Q.  It's all dirty?

A.  It's all dirty.  Yeah, there's not a

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1076
Page 420 clean part of smoke.

Q.  Number 2 � Number 2, he says:  Present

technology does not permit selective filtration of

particulate smoke.

What's that mean?

A.  Well, there had been hope before that maybe you could use a filter to take out the arsenic or a polycyclic, something else.

But there's recognition that that's really a thermodynamic impossibility.  You can't really just isolate out one part of the smoke.

It's � it's � it's a very difficult problem.

Q.  So internally and privately, Dr. Wakeham � Dr. Wakeham, by the way, is part of the conspiracy, right?

A.  Yes.  He's � at various points, he's head of the technical committee of the conspiracy, which was directly under the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  Okay.  So 1961, I believe, Dr. Wakeham from Philip Morris internally is recognizing: There's carcinogens in all aspects of smoke, in all compounds of smoke, and we can't selectively filter out any particulate from smoke, right?

A.  That's right, can't take the bad out and

Q.  We're going to come back to this in a few minutes.  Okay?

At the same time, was Reynolds also � I'm sorry, was Brown & Williamson also using overseas research facilities?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So now we're into the '60s. We're in 1962.  And is Reynolds � I'm sorry again.  Reynolds � I'm saying Reynolds because you know Reynolds purchased Brown & Williamson, right?

A.  They did.

Q.  So for purposes of a historical discussion, they're separate companies?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Today Reynolds is Brown & Williamson, is American, is Lorillard, right?

A.  They've purchased all of those companies.

Q. So I'm going to stick to Brown & Williamson when we're talking about their document.

Brown & Williamson, they worked with an overseas research institute.  What was that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1078
Page 4210 called?

A.  Well, there was one called Battelle Hippo or Battelle Corporation.  It's a private contracting research facility with offices all over the world, and they did a series of secret experiments at Geneva in the Battelle office.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  And we move into evidence PT1945.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  So that's PT1945, no objection.

THE COURT:  It will be admitted into evidence without objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT1945 was received in evidence.)

Q.   (BY MR. GDANSKI)  This is �

THE COURT:  And we're going to take a lunch break in a few minutes, so you tell me when you're � what's a good breaking point for you.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to get to PT3615.

Is there any objection to that?

MR. BRENNER:  I'll check.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's the next one coming

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1079
Page 4211 up, and then we can break.

MR. FURR:  Yes, we do have an objection

to that one.

MR. GDANSKI:  So I'll do this one for

now.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  1962, The Effects of Smoking, Proposal for Further Research Contracts with Battelle:  Research contracts with Battelle started in 1959.  The overall objective is to increase our knowledge of the physiological and psychological effects of smoking and to explore the possibilities of obtaining the same results by a device other than the cigarette. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's go to Page 7.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the companies know that, above all other things, they needed to understand how addiction controlled smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It says here:  What we need to know above all things is what constitutes the hold of smoking, that is, to understand addiction?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  On the subject of nicotine and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1080
Page 4212 addiction, you know, are there examples in the historical record going back decades, if not centuries, of the importance of nicotine and smoking?

A.  Yes.  It's identified first in tobacco in the first couple decades of the 19th century.

Q.  If I wanted to or if we had time or if Mr. Furr wanted to and he had time, could we show you textbooks and newspaper articles and Reader's Digest articles of other things that say nicotine is important when it comes to smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did the industry research that extensively?

A.  They did.

Q.  And did they exploit it?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now in doing their research on nicotine, did the industry actually come to have a far more extensive understanding of nicotine than even in the published peer-reviewed scientific literature?

A.  They did.

Q.  And is �

MR. GDANSKI:  Page 9.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1081
Page 4213 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Does the public,

Dr. Proctor, understand � the public, the layperson, the one of many smokers, did they understand the true importance that nicotine had on smoking?

A.  No.

Q.  Did the industry?

A.  They understood it far better.

Q.  As a result of these various researches, we now possess a knowledge of the effects of nicotine far more extensive than exists in published scientific literature.

That's their own statement internally?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So with Battelle doing this research, what happened?

A.  Well, it's an effort to basically create a safer cigarette.  It can be seen as the prehistory of the electronic cigarette.

The theory was:  Let's see if we can lose the cancer, keep the addiction.

In other words, sort of lose the � you know, change the tar in such a way that it's not addictive, or even eliminate the tar and keep the addictive.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=1082
Page 4214 And it generates the Ariel device, which

was essentially a nicotine inhaler, which is

patented.

Q.  By who?

A.  By Brown & Williamson, BAT.

Q.  And after you have the research starting to come out from Battelle, what takes place within that research?

I mean so you have the institute doing the research.  What does the company that's paying for the research do with it?

A.  Well, it's deliberately withheld from the Surgeon General, among other things.  It's also used to build up a model of how to create a noncancerous cigarette.

Q.  And �

THE COURT:  All right.  This is your last question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  � in examining the research and the communications on this subject, did Reynolds, through their employees, conclude that:  Hey, we know moreover that nicotine is addictive and smoking cigarettes causes cancer?

CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Good afternoon, Dr. Proctor.

A    Good afternoon.

Q    How are you doing?

A    Good.

Q    Before we broke, we were talking about the overseas research done at the request and paid for by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company with the research entity known as Battelle.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    What was the timeframe of that again?

A    We were talking about research effort from 1959 into the mid 1960s.

Q    Okay.  You're familiar with somebody named Addison Yeaman?

A    Yes.

Q    Who was Addison Yeaman?

A    He was a top lawyer for the Brown & Williamson Company and a member of the Committee of Counsel.

Q    Remind the jury, please, what was the Committee of Counsel?

A    That's this group here, the COC.  It's technically part of the Tobacco Institute.  It was

matters of health and disease.

Q    They had a lot of power?

A    Yes.

Q    After Battelle did that research, do we have documents and records indicating what information was shared between Battelle and Brown & Williamson and what Brown & Williamson did with that information?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 3615, we'll move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  We have an objection we need to take up with the Court. THE COURT:  Okay. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, this is one of the Bliley documents that we have discussed previously.  I know during our last conversation there was some confusion about these kinds of documents because they're on our web site.  So I have brought you a copy of what is on our web site.  If you'll see on the face of it, it has a clear disclaimer that is a compelled production. At the bottom of the document you see the exact

I've also brought you a copy of what is on our web site which is the privilege log.  The privilege log includes the privileges that we continue to assert.  It also states the date that the document was loaded onto the web site.

I know that previously counsel had represented to you that this was loaded as part of the MSA, and that is not true.  This document was loaded January 25, 2011 in response to an order from Judge Keesler over our objections. We continue to assert privilege, Your Honor.  We have never waived that.  And because this document is privileged, it must not be admitted.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, this document came in in the Engle case in 1999 when that case was tried.  We pick up exactly where Engle left off. That is the case law.  The Florida Supreme Court found it would be error, it would be error to not permit us to use the Engle record.  This case is the Douglas case in the Florida Supreme Court.  It says we pick up exactly where the Engle plaintiffs left off, we stand in their shoes.  This is the evidence list of exhibits from the Phase I Engle trial.  There is no

This is a bad faith objection, Judge.  I here a copy of the Reynolds' web site where they've disclosed what's on their web site. This references the fact that they disclosed documents as part of Judge Keesler's order.

THE COURT:  As part of what?

MR. GDANSKI:  Part of Judge Keesler, the Judge in the Federal District of Columbia's RICO case against the tobacco companies.

This is a document that deals with research done at the request of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.  It's been admitted in nearly every single Engle progeny case that I've ever tried.  I know of very, very few instances in which this document has not been introduced into evidence.

I've already said it's been admitted in Engle, but it described the fact that they knew moreover nicotine was addictive, describes the fact that they know of smoking and its unattractive side effects.  It certainly that it causes lung cancer and emphysema.  I have here for Your Honor, I'll to hand to the Court, this is from their web site where they make the

web site.

THE COURT:  Does this case refer to the fact that it picks up where you left off?  Does it indicate anything about that the exhibits can be utilized from that case?

MR. GDANSKI:  It doesn't specifically reference exhibits, but we stand in their shoes. We go forward from where they left off.  So that means we pick up from where they left off.  It mean wherever they left off, we start from, and that means that it includes the exhibits and the documentary record.

We should be able to introduce all of the records.  This document was specifically referenced and the other Bliley documents were specifically referenced by the State of Minnesota sued the tobacco industry --

THE COURT:  Why are they called Wiley?

MR. GDANSKI:  Bliley, B-L-I-L-E-Y.

THE COURT:  Why are they called that?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because Congressman Bliley subpoenaed these documents and the tobacco companies turned them over.

However, Judge, it's on their publicly

look at our response to the Bliley motion which

demonstrates the fact that these documents were

not compelled production.  They were produced by

the tobacco companies.  They were voluntarily

produced and then turned over by Congressman

Bliley.  They are publicly available right now

on the Philip Morris' web site.  You can go onto

Philip Morris' web site and get them.

THE COURT:  Are they a part of the case?

MR. GDANSKI:  Philip Morris is a party to this case, yes.  And obviously Brown & Williamson is a party as well to this case. These are defendants.  They are statements of party opponents.  They no longer maintain a credible privilege to a document anybody can get online right now anywhere in this country. They've waived that privilege based on they never asserted --

THE COURT:  Does the ones on the Philip Morris web site also have the compelled production on the front of it?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know if Philip Morris has a compelled production on theirs, but the ones on the Legacy database, which I am prepared

production on it because those were not

compelled to be produced.  These are documents

that are at various points in time produced.

This document was admitted in Engle.  It was not part of the compelled production.  It was admitted in multiple Engle progeny trials, not part of the compelled production.  And quite frankly, it's an important and pivotal document in the context of what they knew and when they knew it.

Because this is 1963, when they say that nicotine is addictive and it has unattractive side effects.  This is the report from the special master in Minnesota, and it includes all of these issues, where there is a finding of crime-fraud.  There is just no genuine good faith legal basis to suggest that these documents are still privileged.

We have introduced this document in about 15 other trials.  My firm has had hundreds across the state.  They have never one time on appeal said, wait a second, the introduction of this or other Bliley documents is somehow impermissible or unacceptable.  It's never

absolutely not error to include it.

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, it would absolutely not be error to exclude it and error to include it.

Let's start at the beginning here.  Douglas does absolutely not stand for the proposition that they can introduce any exhibit that was used in Engle.  That's not the way these Engle cases have been tried and that is not what Douglas says.

Let's move to our web site.  The web site specifically has this disclaimer language that I have handed up to you, it is highlighted.  It says, we do not waive our privilege on these.

I think counsel is somehow suggesting that we voluntarily produced these documents in response to a subpoena from Congress.  Let's be clear about that.  One, we were required under subpoena to produce the documents.  We were threatened with jail if we did not comply.

When we produced the documents, we produced them with a letter that said, we continue to reserve our privilege.  We scheduled a meeting to talk about it.  We sent subsequent letters.

They are also attached to the motion that we

previously filed at H, I and J.

If counsel would like to invoke the crime-fraud privilege, then Your Honor must have an evidentiary hearing on each and every document that they want to go into.

THE COURT:  Well, if you wanted to have an evidentiary hearing, then you needed to do that in advance of trial.  We set up -- I remember having available on those two days and I said, does anybody here need to put on any evidence? Nobody wanted to put on any evidence.  I had to dismiss the clerk.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't need an evidentiary hearing.  I'm not asking �

THE COURT:  They say they wanted an evidentiary hearing.

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes, your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not mine.

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, it would be reversible error.

THE COURT:  Exactly what I'm saying is that they didn't take advantage of that situation. So why don't you let me make my argument instead

THE COURT:  Let the record reflect laughter from the Court.

MS. LEHMAN:  I think the point is, Your Honor, that we received an exhibit list of thousands of exhibits.  It would literally not be possible for us to request a specific hearing on each individual objection that we have.  I'll show you the Marco group versus Palm Beach � versus McGregor.  I'll hand it up to you.

THE COURT:  What I'm saying is, if you wanted an evidentiary hearing, I set one up and you could have had � you didn't put anything on regarding it.  So we're now in the middle of trial.  I can't have an evidentiary hearing in the middle of this trial.  That's just not practical.  I don't know why my ruling on this would be any different than it has been on the other ones.

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, you have not previously ruled on the Bliley documents.

privilege, whether this was Bliley or not.  We

had a document earlier in trial where they said

privileged.  I said publicly available, anyone

can get it right now.  Your Honor, they can't

That's 100 percent accurate.

MS. LEHMAN:  That was not a Bliley argument, Your Honor.  This is different.

THE COURT:  Why is this document different than those?

MS. LEHMAN: This document is different because we have never voluntarily waived the privilege on this document.

Florida law is absolutely clear we must voluntarily waive.

MR. GDANSKI:  It was exactly the same.

MS. LEHMAN:  No, sir, not that we're claiming Bliley over, no, sir.

MR. GDANSKI:  There are privileged documents.  I don't know if there are Bliley documents,  that's true.

Judge, even under the master settlement agreement, they're required � when the State of Florida settled this lawsuit against the tobacco companies, they're required to hand up a copy of that to Your Honor, to make disclosure of these documents publically.

This has been introduced many, many times, this document and others.  They never appealed this issue one time this issue.  I agree with

much different than the other one we did before

where they were compelled production.  They

claim these documents are different.  They can't

seem to explain to me why they're different than

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    By 1964 the Surgeon General's report comes

out, right?

A    Yes, January.

Q    What was the genesis of that?  In other

words, why was it in 1964 the Surgeon General came

out with a report?  How did that process start,

evolve, and take place?

A    President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, in the

spring of 1962 had been asked what he thinks about

the Royal College of Physicians' report from that

year, 1962, which indicted smoking as a cause of lung

cancer.  That was an official influential British

Page 4237 report.  Kennedy was asked about this at a news

conference.  He said he didn't know anything about

it.

So he assigned his Surgeon General, Luther

Terry, to assemble a blue ribbon committee of

scholars who would evaluate the evidence, and over

the course of about a year and a half, they reviewed

the evidence and came to the determination that

cigarette smoking did cause lung cancer in men and

probably in women as well and caused some other

diseases in smokers as well.

Q    Was JFK a smoker?

A    Yes.

Q    Was Jackie?

A    They were both smokers.

Q   When he was asked what he thought about

smoking causing cancer, he didn't know?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Calling for hearsay,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What's the importance �

THE COURT:  Was that hearsay from the

President of the United States?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

Page 4238 THE COURT:  I've never had that objection

before.  I happily sustain that one. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What is the meaning � in the totality of the story, what's the importance of John F. Kennedy actually requiring the commission of a study as opposed to just saying �

A    The British had come to this conclusion and so America wanted to do its own investigation to see if the British were right.

Q    How did that process work?  How did they start the investigative process?

A    A blue ribbon committee was assembled of people who had not made any statements about whether smoking caused cancer.  In that sense it was a committee of innocents, a kind of neutral jury, you might say.

They were from various fields of science. Two had previously worked for the tobacco industry. Half were smokers. Half were nonsmokers. They did this investigation reviewing already published literature. They didn't do much of their own research. It was mainly reviewing the state of the art.

Q    Did the tobacco companies have some measure

Page 4239 of control over who was appointed as the panel of

researchers ?

A    They did.  From the beginning, again, the presumption was that no one who had already taken a stance on this would be allowed to be on the committee, but also various groups, the American Cancer Society, the tobacco industry were given a veto power over who would actually be on the committee.

Q    Did the tobacco industry have any veto power or striking power?

A    They had veto power, yes.

Q    Did they ever exercise it?

A    No.

Q    Now, were there people who wrote portions � or were the reviewers of portions of the reports who ultimately went on to work for tobacco companies?

A    Yes.

Q    Tell the jury about that.

A    Well, one of the people, Maury Severs, who actually drafts the chapter concluding that smoking was a habit rather than an addiction, he previously worked for the American Tobacco Company as a consultant, and later went on to head � right after

Medical Association's Educational Research

Foundation, one of the arms of the conspiracy.

Q    Now, as part of the tobacco company's involvement with the Surgeon General's committee and the authorship and research behind the report, did the Surgeon General and the government reach out to the manufacturer � the seller, the manufacturer, and say, hey, give us what you've got, share with us what you know about the product?

A    Yes.

Q    How do you know that?

A   Well, that was a request that was posed to each of the cigarette manufacturers and to other bodies as well, the American Cancer Society, everyone was supposed to provide what entry research they had on this question.

Q    So by 1962, '63, the process is underway. The report comes out after President Kennedy is assassinated, right?

A    It does, about two months afterwards.

Q    Do we know what, if anything, the industry shared or withheld from the research committee?

A    Yes.

through the research they were supporting that

nicotine was addictive?

A    Some of the companies that were involved in that that later become Reynolds had made that explicit in their archives.

Q    I said Reynolds.  I meant Brown & Williamson, right?

A    That's correct.

Q    By 1964 had Brown & Williamson done research that demonstrated and concluded that nicotine was addictive and smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer?

A    Yes.

Q    So with that information in hand, do we know what Brown & Williamson did as to whether or not it chose, as they could have, to share it with the Surgeon General or withhold it?

A    Yes.

Q    And do we know from the record whether or not Brown & Williamson withheld information from the Surgeon General?

A    We do.

Q    What do you know about that?

A    Well, it was actually a policy.  We have a

Q    PT 978, the outgoing cable, have you seen that before?

A    Yes.

Q    What was the interaction between the different individuals discussing what to share and what not to share and what to withhold from the Surgeon General?

A    Well, you have to recall that Brown & Williamson was part owned by British American Tobacco, so they're collaborating in this collaboration with Hippo Battelle, so the lawyer from Brown & Williamson writes to the lawyer from British American Tobacco commenting on whether it was advisable that certain things be shared with the

Q    In exchanging this discourse of whether or

not it's advisable to share some research with the

Surgeon General or whether or not it's advisable not

to, what did the company do?

A    Well, they did not share the Hippo results or for -- any of the other sensitive information.

Q    We have that document.  You've seen that, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    It's publicly available for anyone to look at these days.

A    Now it is.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's PT 978.  We'd move that

Q    It says, Re: submission Battelle for Griffith developments.  So I want to break it down. I'm not going to say what anything says that's not in evidence.

They're discussing a document created � research created in a document which you know about from the research of the Battelle Institute and you know about from a document written by the chief of analytics, right?

A    Yes.  And it's hundreds of documents.  It's not just one document.

Q    And in discussing whether or not they want to share that with the people who needed to know the

A    Yes.

Q    They decide that sharing it would be undesirable, right?

A    Yes.  It says, Finch agrees submission of the Battelle or Griffith developments to the Surgeon General undesirable.

Q    So these are lawyers � Stevens is a lawyer, right?

A    Yes.

Q    This is a lawyer deciding not to share research with the people who need to find out the truth regarding smoking and addiction and smoking and cancer?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    It says to � Finch agrees submission of Battelle or Griffith to the Surgeon General undesirable.  And we agree continuance of the Battelle work useful but disturbed at its implications regarding cardiovascular disorders.

So, Dr. Proctor, the question to you is this.  Ultimately was the request by the lawyers not to share the research done by Battelle as documented

ultimately, was that request adhered to and withheld

from the Surgeon General as they investigated this

important issue?

A    It was withheld.  Yeah, they did not give the Surgeon General the Battelle Hippo research data.

Q    Philip Morris, we looked at some research that Dr. Wakeham was performing?

A    Yes.

Q    Just remind � that was where we had the carcinogens and the selected filtration?

Q    Was Philip Morris also asked on behalf of the entire industry to share research with the Surgeon General's committee?

Page 4247 Q    What are we looking at?  Tell the jury,

please.

A    This is part of the correspondence between Philip Morris and the Surgeon General's office making certain comments about filters and about whether there are carcinogens in smoke.

Q    So it's to James Hundley, the Assistant Surgeon General from operations, May 20, 1963?

A    Yes.

Q    It is on behalf of the entity industry?

A    Yes.

Q    It says, From review of large mass of published literature, we are prepared and submit herewith a compendium of, quote, chemical constituents in tobacco and smoke. That's a large document?

A    It is.

Q    It's several hundred pages?

A    I don't remember exactly but it's thick.

Q    You will note that it was not undertaken of this compendium to judge the reliability of either the qualitative or quantitative information. Then they make two claims, right?

A    Yes.

Q    What's the first claim?

substances listed therein in this submission to our

knowledge has been found by scientific research to be

harmful to the health of the smoker in amounts

reported in smoke.

The second claim is, It's possible, of

course, to modify the chemical composition of

cigarette smoke by the use of filters.

Q    Let's break that down a little bit.

So the Surgeon General, when they're asked to share the truth, they say that, Nothing in cigarettes has been found to be harmful to the health of a smoker, right?

A    Yes.

Q    They also say, It's possible to modify the composition of cigarette smoke by use of filters?

A    Yes.

Q    1961.  What does Dr. Wakeham say internally

about whether or not there's cancer-causing agents in

cigarette smoke?

A    He says, Carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke.

Q But to the Surgeon General they say, there's nothing that causes harmful effects to smokers in cigarette smoke?

A    Not in the amounts reported.

Q    What does Dr. Wakeham say internally and privately about whether or not technology permits filtration or filters to take out and modify composition of smoke?

A    It says, Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke.

Q    What does Philip Morris, employer of Dr. Wakeham, say to the Surgeon General about the subject of whether or not filters can modify the composition of cigarette smoke?

A    They say, It is possible, of course, to modify the chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of filters.

Q    What's the importance of all of this, sort of the way in which they shared information with the

A    There's a disconnect between what they're admitting privately -- or what they knew privately and what they were admitting to the Surgeon General.

Q    You called it a disconnect.  Historically it can be called a lie, right?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Is it honest?

A    It's not honest.

Q   When we talked last week about some of the early sort of the � I think you called one the Magna Carta or the fundamental document that sort of paved the road.  Do you remember one that talked about sharing information in the Frank Statement with the public health community?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they do that?  Did they really share honest information with the public health community?

A    No.

Q    You also saw an internal document that we shared with the jury that discussed smearing and belittling and attacking and overwhelming the Surgeon General.  Did they do that?

THE COURT:  Uh-huh. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  I'm not objecting to this question because I understand the Court's prior ruling to be that Surgeon General's reports more than 20 years old, statements of facts contained therein come in under the exception to the ancient documents rule I believe this Court has ruled, therefore, I'm not objecting.

But given how the ebb and flow of issues have been, I want to be clear that I'm not

THE COURT:  If they're statements of opinion, those are objected to.

MR. FURR:  They're statements of fact and they're statements of opinion.

THE COURT:  The statements of opinion are � have to have a separate basis for admissions.  Statements of facts do not.  That's the research you guys showed me last week --

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not my research.  So my question is, what did they conclude in the 1964 Surgeon General's report?  Is there an objection or not?  I don't know where I stand.

MR. GDANSKI:  My question now � I'm not seeking to introduce the '64 Surgeon General's report.  My question is, what did they conclude in the 1964 Surgeon General's report?  Am I going back and asking it again or am I not?  I don't know where we are.

THE COURT:  Did you already ask it before?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's the question that brought Mr. Furr up here, where he sort of objected, and then Mr. Brenner helped him, and

opinions

right or wrong, but from a factual perspective, what

did the � historically 1964 Surgeon General's report

conclude?

A Well, I already mentioned that it concluded that cigarettes cause cancer in men and probably also in women.

Q    Lung cancer?

A    Yes.

Q It didn't address every cancer under the sun, did it?

A    No.

Q    What did it say about causing cancer in women, lung cancer in women?

A    Probably also, yes.

Q    So did the '64 Surgeon General's report generate news coverage?

A    Yes, it was widely covered, big news.

Q What's the importance of it being widely covered? Looking at � taking us back, what's the importance of it being newsworthy?

A    Well, there was -- this news was like an old friend being betrayed, that people had become accustomed to.  Half of doctors were smoking. Astronauts were smoking.  Presidents were smoking.

Q    We want to introduce PT 1542 and 1524.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, there would be

objection to these documents, which is the same

as that for the document which the Court has

under consideration right now.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll defer on those.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Prior to the Surgeon General's report

coming out, did the different companies discuss with

their law firms as part of the Ad Hoc Committee and

the Committee of Counsel whether or not they should

share information, how they should share it, was

there a discourse?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the different companies reach out to

their law firms and decide what to share and what not

to share?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you tell the jury about that process?

all of these questions of smoking and health.  That

was their assignment, their job description.  So of

course they would be responsible for determining what

types of things should or should not be said about

the report.

Q    You're familiar with the firm White & Case?

A    Yes.

Q    Have you seen an evidentiary record � without showing the document now, have you seen an evidentiary record of a communication between the client, Brown & Williamson �

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

Mr. Gdanski is asking the witness about the

substance of the documents that were just

reserved upon by the Court.  It's improper.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Please ask another

question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the lawyers for the tobacco companies advise their clients to withhold information from the Surgeon General and the United States Government about smoking and health?

A    Yes.

did the client agree and, in fact, withhold

information from the Government about smoking and

health?

A    They withheld, yes.

Q    Did that process of the lawyer � law firms hired by the companies advising the clients not to share, not to be frank with the Government or the public and the client listening and, in fact, not being frank with the public, did that continue on? MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q For how long did the law firms for the tobacco companies as part of the fraud help keep information from the public?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

A    Yes.

Q    Just like in 1954, when the mouse painting studies came out and there was the See It Now special, in 1964 when the Surgeon General came out, was there also television news, media coverage about the announcement of the report?

A    I think I have at one time or another. Q    It's longer than the few minutes we're going to show.

Q    There's a clip in the beginning where it shows them all in the Rotunda, in the room?

A    Yes.

Q   What's that?

A    That's the members of the Surgeon General's committee on this � the stage with Luther Terry presenting the results of the report to the assembled auditorium of journalists.

MR. GDANSKI:  Do you have that portion? We'll play that later.

Page 4263 ways, including radio and television.  So any

news which seems likely to affect smoking habits

is major news for the country as a whole, for

the citizen as an individual.

So far in the developing concern about

smoking and health the national reaction has

been to keep smoking.  It has been noted that

today's report is the culmination of a great

many studies and a great deal of concern.  It is

as close as we can come in this country to an

official and impartial statement of the facts,

but it is also a beginning rather than an end.

What happens now is the process of decision

on what to do about it by government agencies, by the

tobacco industry, by advertising media, newspapers

and magazines, radio and television.

CBS announced today that it is undertaking

an immediate study of the report and will re-examine

its advertising standards in light of the findings.

ABC and NBC made similar statements.  In addition,

CBS through its representative on the Television Code

Review Board, will participate in a study of industry

standards later this month.

Above all, every American who smokes and

every American youngster who is thinking of smoking

Page 4264 must consider whether to stop or not to start.  It

comes down to a subjective question.  There is no

question but what smoking has meant a great deal to a

great many people.  An old smoker never forgets how

he started.

And through the lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring companion.  The familiar slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of our lives.  It's like being told that an old friend has all along been betraying you.  In a case like that, you give the old friend every possible chance before you finally start to believe what you have been told, and then maybe even then you give him a chance to reform.

In this kind of a country it comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him either.  The decision is his, the decision and the health that may depend on it.

Page 4265 nature of nicotine addiction, how important that was

in continued smoking?

A    No.

Q    Why is that important?

A    Well, at this time the Surgeon General had not concluded that smoking was addictive, unlike some of the industry's own internal documents.

Q There's a reference in there, for example, to CBS evaluating its advertising practices. That's a good thing, right?

A    Would have been good if they would have done it.

Q    Did CBS, NBC, ABC, any of the three stations that were around back then, after the '64 report abstain from accepting tobacco advertising money?

A    No.

Q    Did any of the magazines, Life, Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Glamour, anybody else abstain from receiving tobacco money at that time?

A    Very few did.  Reader's Digest continued with its policy of not taking tobacco ads.

Q    Any of the companies or magazines or periodicals that were already taking money from the industry, did they stop after?

billboard?

A    Yes.

Q    Was that an important technological advertising billboard?

A    It was.  It was an automatic mechanical billboard that was a very large format that blew steam out and smoke rings.  It was, you know, viewed as sort of a technical marvel for its age.

Q    Did that show from Harry Reasoner on CBS News in 1964 also have individuals speaking on behalf of the tobacco companies?

A    Yes.

Q    So you know who Joseph Cullman was?

A    Yes.

Q    Who was � who spoke for the companies on that show?

A    That was Howard Cullman, the president of the Tobacco Merchants Association, and someone who was related to � by ancestry to Joseph Cullman.

Q    I got the names wrong.  If you look at the Frank Statement, one of them is signed by a Cullman I think?

Page 4268 correspondent Richard C. Hoffa put some

questions to one of the leading spokesmen for

the industry, Howard Cullman, president of the

Tobacco Merchants Association and a longtime

director of the Philip Morris Company.

Mr. Cullman, prominent in the New York theater

and civic affairs, is a third-generation member

of a tobacco family.

Mr. Cullman, the conclusions are pretty stark and pretty solid.  They say quite flatly, they express the judgment that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and the overall death rate, and they have the rate 10 times as high for smokers in the case of lung cancer and rather higher in other cases.

That's awful hard to define the word "substantial."  I don't believe that most people who smoke get lung cancer.  We are now in an era, as you know, of modification.  We eat more carefully.  We have cholesterol habits.  We have drinking habits and lighter whiskey.  We have smoking habits, which incidentally are today changing the type of cigarettes from regular cigarettes to filters.

Page 4269 Now, I was surprised at the beginning of

the conference when Dr. Terry was supposed to

have said that there was very little evidence,

if any, on the effect of any of filtered

cigarettes.  So when we have today 60 percent of

the business in the filter field compared to

3 percent ten years ago, I think we need a

little more research.  I'm convinced that

eventually they will find some element through a

filter or through leaf growing or special type

of seed growing that will eliminate the

mysterious thing they are looking for.  We want

to be protected just as much as the Surgeon

General or the AMA.  We'll cooperate in every

way.

Well, are you saying, then, sir, that there is something toxic about tobacco which are removable by filter?

Well, obviously a filter takes out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the industry admits there are any bad elements.  If there are bad elements, through our laboratories, through the Surgeon General, through the AMA, through acts of God and the like, we hope we may find them.  If they are found, they will be removed,

Does any of the research that the tobacco

industry has been engaged in refute any part of

the findings here or the conclusions as a whole? Well, without reading the report, I

couldn't answer that.  Forgive me.  I don't

think that the tobacco industry as a whole

agrees with the conclusions. (Thereupon, the video ended.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   That's a high-level tobacco executive, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    The theme of more research is needed?

A    Yes.

Q    How, Dr. Proctor, does that theme, that idea of, more research is needed, we need to just keep looking, let's keep an open mind, you know, let's be fair about the process, how does that affect smoking behaviors?

A    Well, it gives glimmers of hope.  It's a type of reassurance.  It's raising doubts.  Slivers of � the idea being you shouldn't close your mind to the possibility that maybe the evidence is not all in.  You should have a smoke.

Q    It talked in there about hard to define the word "substantial."  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q   We talked about it last week, sort of making the conversation � in one of the documents referenced making the discourse so technical as to raise it above the easy common sense understanding?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you explain what that means as we've seen things evolve?

A    It's true that he says, most smokers don't get lung cancer.  On the other hand, there's a very substantial increase in the probability of getting smoking cancer.  So he's kind of playing both sides of that fence.

Q    And it talked about, there was a question about whether or not any of the research done within Philip Morris or in the company was able to refute the findings of the Surgeon General.  What is the

seen?

A    They already knew clearly that it was addictive and was causing cancer.

Q    After the 1964 Surgeon General's report, did the industry give smokers � intentionally give smokers a psychological crutch to keep smoking? A    Yes.

Q    This idea of a psychological crutch, where does that come from?

A    That's from a January 1964 letter from George Weissman to Joseph Cullman, the president and CEO of Philip Morris, about two weeks after the release of the Surgeon General's report.

MR. GDANSKI:  So it's PT 1933.  We'd move that into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  Can we approach briefly on this, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Sure.  Sidebar. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. BRENNER:  We have a redaction. MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  I don't agree, no.

MR. GDANSKI: No, sir, because � I know what it says, but here is the point. What we talked about last week --

THE COURT:  You're talking about the legislature here?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, yes, but this protection that they have as it relates to labeling and preemption doesn't kick in until 1969.

MR. BRENNER:  That's a separate issue, though.

MR. GDANSKI:  They conceded that last week.

THE COURT:  It may not be preemption.  They could be lobbying the state legislations.

MR. BRENNER:  Not making a preemption objection, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  We're allowed to criticize them for that before 1969.  We are allowed to say that they watered down the label.  They watered down the warning.  They watered down the caution before 1969.  They were allowed to do that.  That protection they had as it relates to petitioning as it relates to doing that doesn't start until after 1969.

THE COURT:  Is this a 404 argument as well?

Page 4275 MR. BRENNER:  It's 4 04, Mr. Gdanski is

just, frankly, mixing apples and oranges.  The

Noerr-Pennington exception has nothing to do

with the preemption exception.  They sometimes

overlap.  They don't have to overlap.  It is

also prejudicial.  I don't have an objection to

the balance of the document, which is -- this is

in my experience what it's used for, but I guess

Mr. Gdanski wants to go further.

THE COURT:  I think from a � A, from a 404 perspective, I find that the -- whatever probative value is very limited, relevance is very limited compared to its possible prejudicial effect.

I also find that it does deal with First Amendment rights that they were pursuing at the time, and so at this time I'm going to --weighing all of that and taking all of that into consideration, I'm going to redact -- I'm going to allow this document into evidence redacting Section Number 3.

MR. GDANSKI:  I won't show it now, and I'll put it in complying with Your Honor's order.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   All right.  We're going to proceed with this document.  It's in evidence PT 1933.  Let's go ahead and take a look.  It's January 29; 1964.  When did the Surgeon General's report come out ?

A    About two weeks earlier.

Q    It's to Joseph Cullman from George Weissman; right?

A    Yes.

Q   The subject is the Surgeon General's report; right?

A    Yes.

Q   Under reaction; now, did the industry study the reaction to these different reports?

A    They did.

Q   It says. While the propaganda blast was tremendous.

So who is it; Dr. Proctor; that the tobacco companies are referring to as people putting out propaganda?

A    The Surgeon General.

Q   While the propaganda blast was tremendous and the penetration of public opinion very widespread; I have the feeling that the public

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    So what is propaganda?

A    It's kind of like a form of very powerful rhetoric.  It's what you do to try to convince someone of something very forcefully with hints of being misleading.

Q    Dr. Proctor, who was putting out propaganda regarding smoking at this time?

A    Well, in reality it was --

Can you explain that in the context of the long-lasting impression one � society had from the report ?

A    Well, there was a little bit of a downtick in the smoking rates, but by the end of the year, smoking rates were hitting new highs.

Q    Let's go down to the bottom section, Public relations program.  The restraint and unity of the industry has been very effective in this period.  The opponents � again, that's the people trying to save lives?

I just don't understand it, Your Honor. You have a direct order on it.  We've gone over it.  It's been so many days ago.  I think it was Thursday or Friday, I believe you brought the witness up specifically, I can't be sure of that.  You've certainly had this discussion with counsel, stay away from low tars.

If you want to talk about filters, you can talk about filters.  I just don't understand how this witness cannot be told in no uncertain terms to stop doing this stuff.  Mr. Gdanski's questions effectively beg him to do it.

At this point, Your Honor, I think that we need to have a discussion about how this witness is being conducted.  After a while it's not a mistake, Judge.  It just can't be a mistake.  I don't know what Mr. Gdanski expected that question to be.  It cannot be filters because filters have been on the market for ten years at the time.  What did he expect it to be?  I was hoping this witness would follow the Court's order and, no, again, he totally, completely,

I told Your Honor at the time it's a completely different story.  There is a whole other case, in fact, there are some cases just about lights and low tar cigarettes, and that should come out because he didn't smoke them. You made the rule and he did -- it keeps coming back up.  It hadn't changed the fact that he never smoked them.  I don't think they're going to testify that he did.  The record as it stands right now is that he didn't.

THE COURT:  I understand that.  This � unfortunately this witness, you know, had a break in the testimony.  It's possible he forgot and, you know, any of the lawyers could have come up and asked and reminded him before we started.  Let me bring him up here and remind him.  I'm going to strike the last answer.

MR. GDANSKI:  Can I make an argument about why all of this is not the way it should be proceeding?  Here is the point, Judge.  Lights and low tars is part of the same fraud and the same conspiracy.  You can't keep them out.  It's not fair.

argument as to why it goes to the punitive

claim.

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course, it goes to everything.

THE COURT:  But as far as the other is concerned, it also is somewhat cumulative.

MR. GDANSKI:  How can it be cumulative if I've been blocked every time?  This is separate and distinct.  Low tar is a separate and distinct --

THE COURT:  What's the conspiracy on light and low tar?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because they told people to switch to them and they lied about all of this. They said all of those were not dangerous.  They said no cigarette --

THE COURT:  This guy only smoked filters.

MR. GDANSKI:  That doesn't matter.  First of all, Judge --

THE COURT:  The direct case evidence doesn't matter?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course not because it's never been stopped from coming in �

Page 4284 MR. GDANSKI:  As far as in any of my cases.

Anyway, the answer to the question is, no, there's no case one way or the other specific on this discrete issue.

Let me back up to the question.  If Dr. Proctor is asked if filtered cigarettes are a form of low tar cigarettes, he will say yes. All they did was just start calling it something else and put less tobacco in the cigarette. They're all part of the same fraud.  They're all part of the same lie.

Whether my guy smoked them or not is not material to this claim in what they did in their conspiracy.  That's the whole point.  They're going to put in tons of documents that have nothing to do with Mr. Shulman.  They're going to put in Reader's Digest articles that he never saw.  He might have seen one.  It doesn't mean he saw them all.

And there's a greater story that both sides wanted to tell, and that story should not be excised out by limited issues here and there. They lied to the public as part of a broad conspiracy on smoking and health about all cigarettes, including lights and low tars.  They

Page 4285 said none of them were dangerous.  That evidence

should come in in any trial that deals with the

conspiracy.

Imagine if you had a criminal conspiracy and there were ten lies as part of the criminal conspiracy, and one of them � only one of them went to person A.  So in person A's trial you can't talk about the other nine lies?  Of course you can.  It's all the lies that go to the conspiracy.  That's Black Letter conspiracy law.

One action taken any action -- this is Black Letter law, any action taken in furtherance of the conspiracy is relevant to the total understanding of the entire conspiracy. What they're asking Your Honor to do is artificially extract certain components that they're scared of.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor �

THE COURT:  Mr. Brenner wants to be heard.

MR. HAMMER:  Before defense goes, you asked if there's any case law.  This has been presented in cases where the smoker did not smoke lights.  The plaintiff won, it went up on appeal, the tobacco -- the defense has never taken up that issue as an Appellate issue, so

appealed because it comes in in all these cases,

even when the smoker doesn't smoke -- even in

cases where the smoker smokes unfiltered

cigarettes his entire life --

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a great point.  There is a case �

MR. HAMMER:  � the filter and the light fraud do come in as part of the fraud and conspiracy.

MR. GUEST:  Dr. Proctor has never and will not testify that the companies entered into a conspiracy for the purpose of developing filtered cigarettes or light and low tar cigarettes in misleading the public about their products.  He won't say that happened.

THE COURT:  Let's give the jury a recess and voir dire on that issue.  I won't do it now but I may do it closer to 3:30 and --

MR. GDANSKI:  I think it's a great idea.

MR. BRENNER:  We keep having the same argument with Your Honor.  You keep coming out the same way.  Their position is anything bad �

And you acknowledged that that was the case.  So you may have � I don't know whether you forgot but you just mentioned low tars again.

objection.  So the last answer that the witness

gave is stricken from the record.  The jury

should disregard it. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, in talking about the campaign of doubt, in talking about the denials that smoking was proven to cause any disease or linked to disease and in talking about the continued marketing of filtered cigarettes, how did the industry give smokers a psychological crutch and a self-rationale to continue smoking?

A    Mainly, I guess through filtered cigarettes.

Q    Did the industry control the campaign at that point?

A    It was their campaign.

Q    By the way, the term "psychological

report.

A   Those words were, yes, with a different meaning.

Q    The meaning here is how the tobacco companies going forward manipulated the atmosphere as it relates to cigarettes and smoking?

A    Through designs, yeah, and reassurance.

Q    So did they make design changes to cigarettes � without speaking about the specific terms attributable to those cigarettes, did they make design changes to cigarettes to try to convince smokers that they were less hazardous?

A    Yes.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection to what

we just spoke about unless the question is just

limited to filtered cigarettes.

THE COURT:  Rephrase your question

accordingly. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Okay.  Did the companies make design changes to the filters on cigarettes in order to give smokers a psychological crutch and a self-rationale to continue smoking?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I just don't understand what Mr. Gdanski is doing.  He knows exactly what those questions are.  That's the definition of a light cigarette, Your Honor.  He even said it at sidebar, light cigarettes were less tobacco in the rod.  This is, Your Honor, at this point --

THE COURT:  The reference to the tar, changes as to the amount of tar elicits a question and answer on tar and light cigarettes, doesn't it?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, I � honestly, no, it doesn't.  If Your Honor gives me the opportunity to ask this witness a question about what light and low tar cigarettes are, this will all become self-explanatory.  Because what they've done is

had special design features which gave smokers a

A    They did.  I think I've already said that. Q    Did they market cigarettes to give smokers a psychological crutch?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they � as part of giving smokers a psychological crutch, did they give them health reassurance?

Q    Dr. Proctor, you used the term earlier, and we'll explain it to the jury, something called special projects.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q   What were the special projects?

A    These were established in the early 1960s as a device run namely by the Ad Hoc Committee of Lawyers to attack scientific products, scientific conclusions in the public health community about cigarettes.

Q    And how was money allocated?  How did these projects get funded?

A    Like the CTR, more generally, it was allocated to market share.  Each company participated into this general fund according to what fraction of the sales were being achieved through their company.

Q    Were the special projects and the Committee of Counsel and Ad Hoc Committee, were those publicly

Q   Do we know from the research or the documents, do you know about the impact and the importance that in reality the special projects had and the Committee of Counsel and the Ad Hoc Committee had?

A    I think they were important, yes.

Q   Have you written about those subjects?

A    Extensively.

Q   Going back into the 1960s and the 1970s, was there an appreciation outside of the tobacco industry by people who were � even people who were interested in the subject � forget laypeople who were just naive and uninterested, but people who were interested in the subject, did they have an in-depth appreciation of the power that the lawyers had and the power of special projects?

Q    PT 3550, Dr. Proctor, what do we know about

the influence of the lawyers as it relates to this

fraud?

A    It was central.  The Committee of Counsel

was the supreme authority for the entire conspiracy.

That was a committee of the top lawyers from each

company.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 3550, we'd move that into

evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  I need a second, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, I have an objection,

Your Honor.  I object.

THE COURT:  All right.  Come on up.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  So again, Your Honor, I don't

know what counsel intends to use.  It's a huge

document.  I can tell you that if he shows me

now, maybe I won't have an objection.  The first

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor ruled that that exact subject matter is absolutely appropriate and denied their motion pretrial.

MR. GDANSKI:  The subject matter was the historical as part of the fraud --

THE COURT:  You say that part of this was objectionable?

MR. BRENNER: I don't know what they intend to use.

MR. GDANSKI:  The part that they say is objectionable --

THE COURT:  What are you going to use?

MR. GDANSKI: I can grab my notebook. It's going to be the influence of the lawyers, the Ad Hoc Committee, the Committee of Counsel, I don't know it by heart but here is the point.

To the extent this deals with the question of the historical role that the lawyers or the defense of litigation played as part of the fraud, Your Honor denied that motion, and we

Page 4297 even had a ruling on it this morning again

solidifying the denial of that motion, and said

so long as it's never tied to this case � which

I have not even come close to doing at any point

in time.  So long as it's not tied to this case,

we can reference this issue.

So it is fair game.  It is relevant.  To come up here and say, well, this document is a lot of pages and so I don't know what they're going to use, but these portions aren't relevant because they say X, Y, Z, it's not true.  Your Honor has ruled that that objection is not well-taken, overruled it, and decided that those portions are relevant as it relates to the claims of the historical fraud.

MR. BRENNER:  I think what Your Honor ruled is to the extent you can make a foundation that some of the litigation was as part of the effort to influence the public, which I still don't understand the foundation but that's what Your Honor ruled on.  You didn't rule that they could put on any evidence they want regarding the lawsuit, which of course would make no sense.

So I'm trying to move this along.  I'm not even saying they have waived the right to put it

Aspects of the Smoking and Health Situation in

the USA 1964.  Let's go to page number 7,

please. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    It says, In consequence of the importance of the lawsuits, the main power in the smoking and health situation undoubtedly rests with the lawyers and more particularly with the policy committee of lawyers.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    The members of the committee are, let's go � one second.  Hold on a second.

matters, research and public relations matters, for

example, as well as legal matters and reports

directly to the President.  Dr. Proctor, is that the

committee you described on your chart to the left?

A    It is.  It's the Committee of Counsel which had about six different names.  It's called the Policy Committee of Lawyers, General Counsel, The Secret Six.  It had about six or seven different names.

Q    It says � let's go down a little bit. The committee is particularly concerned with possible congressional legislation and it drew up the Cigarette Advertising Code.

So, Dr. Proctor, who � the Cigarette Advertising Code, what was that?

A    That was the voluntary code developed in the early 1960s by the companies.

Q    And who ultimately wrote it, the lawyers?

A    The lawyers wrote it.

Q    We understand the code was largely a work of Mr. Ramm.  Do you know who that was?

A    Yes.

Q    The policy committee, and then it describes the second group of lawyers, the Ad Hoc Group?

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    So the Ad Hoc Group is concerned with medical/legal matters.  Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    This is in the context of litigation?

A    Yes.  These are the outside lawyers contracted by the companies.

Q    So, Dr. Proctor, how, as part of the continuation and the perpetuation of the fraud did the outside lawyers contract with medical witnesses for medical/legal matters?

Page 4302 Group, so the outside lawyers, work with medical

witnesses in litigation in lawsuits?

A    Yes, that was part of the conspiracy.

Q    How?  How is that?  How is the working of lawyers for tobacco companies with medical/legal witnesses, doctors and physicians part of the fraud and conspiracy?  Tell the jury.

A    It's called friendly research.  People who would agree with the principles put forward by the conspiracy.  They would pay people for this.

Q    And as part of the fraud and conspiracy, were the lawyers for the tobacco companies effective in essentially getting the witnesses that they retained to say whatever the lawyers wanted them to say?

A    Yes.  That was part of the conspiracy. That was one of the pillars.

Q    Did they do that for many, many years?

A    Many years.

Q    It says here, In addition there are two other communities of lawyers, one for dealing with the Federal Trade Commission and a litigation committee �

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    From a public perspective, from a humane perspective, what's the result of the confusion and doubt created by the tobacco company?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative and argumentative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I have not asked that. THE COURT:  Sustained.  Ask another question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the industry recognize, Dr. Proctor, that the keyword was confusion?

A    That is a -- I think actually a quote from one of their documents.

Q    So why, why was the keyword, the word, the concept, why was the keyword or the concept key to create and sustain confusion?

Q    Why was that so important, continued sale

of cigarettes?

A    Why was that important to the companies?

Q   Yes, sir.

A    That was their priority, to sell as many cigarettes as they could.

Q    What did the industry understand, based on the documents you've reviewed, about how the concept of confusion, the concept of doubt, how that can impact or affect the addicted smoker?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  This

relates to a document.  It's not been offered

yet.  It falls into a category the Court has

under consideration.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    That question has nothing � what does creating doubt have to � how does creating doubt impact the addicted smoker based on what you've reviewed from tobacco companies?

their side.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, may we approach?

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. FURR:  I hate to keep coming up here. This technique is just totally improper.  What Mr. Gdanski is doing is literally reading from Bliley documents that he knows he can't get into evidence, so instead he's reading from the documents.  The last sentence -- question he just asked was a sentence from a Bliley document.  He knows he's not supposed to be

MR. GDANSKI:  I didn't introduce the document.  I can talk about forcefully refuting Reader's Digest.

THE COURT:  Is the only basis for that this document that's at issue?

MR. FURR:  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  They've refuted Reader's Digest all over the place.

THE COURT:  Where else do they do that?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't have all those at my fingertips because I've never been blocked out of this document ever.

THE COURT:  Unless there's a predicate question based on a document other than this one, you should not get into it because I've already said I'm going to deal with this later.

At Cooper's Last Stand," "Nicotine Knock Out."  You

mentioned a couple different articles.

Did the industry respond to those not

specifically indirectly, but did they refute them in

a general sense?

A    Yes, especially after the 1950s.  They weren't as much of a threat earlier, so it's not a lot of response.

Q Did the industry also do � take polls as to what smokers thought at different points in time as to filters, whether they worked or not?

A    Yes.

Q   So we discussed some of the issues regarding filters last week, and how they increased the risk of cancer.

Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q Can cigarettes obviously be designed with and without filters?

A    Of course.

Q   Just tell the jury, as a design expert, what the importance of, if anything, filters have on cigarettes.

an illusion of safety and I think that's why they're

put on the cigarettes, to reassure the smoker.

Q    Do we know from �

A    They're also cheaper.

Q    Cheaper, why are they cheaper?

A   Cellulose acetate, the principal material used, is a little bit cheaper than actual tobacco. That was another reason.

Q    Is the illusion of filtration a powerful illusion that persists to this day?

A    It is.

Q    Do we know from data that's studied the impact � not the impact, but what smokers perceived, believed, and said about filters and whether they reduced the health risks commissioned by the tobacco companies?

A    Yes.

Q    PT 3658, a poll from the Roper Research Organization prepared for the Tobacco Institute. You're familiar with that?

Page 4310 commissioned by a tobacco company trade group, the

Tobacco Institute �

A    It is.

Q    � so they could know what are our clients, our customers thinking.

A    Yes.  They were tracking them very closely.

Q    Why was it � I think it goes without saying, but it won't get written down unless someone says it.

Why was it so important for them to track what customers were thinking?

A    They needed to know what ordinary smokers thought in order to optimize and perfect their sales.

Q    Did they do that?  Did they study the psychology of the smoker so as to maximize profits?

A    Intensively.

Q    3658.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It will be admitted into

evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT3658 was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    This just says what we just said, Tobacco Institute 1970, right?

A    Yes.

Page 4311 Q    Let's go to page number 24.  Here is a

poll.  When asked about filters, it said filters

reduce the health risks in cigarette smoking.  And

what percentage said � of smokers responded they

agreed with that?

A    58 percent said they agreed that filters did reduce the health risks in cigarette smoke.

Q    So most smokers, based on this poll, thought filters reduced the health risks in cigarette smoking?

A    Yes, they felt they were safer.

Q    And Dr. Proctor, you weren't specifically asked to study which brands Mr. Shulman smoked, right ?

A    No.

Q    By the way, Dr. Proctor, how many cases have you testified in over the course of your years and years studying this subject?

A    Altogether, it's probably about 100 cases, altogether, over nearly 20 years.

Q    Okay.  In some of the cases have you ever looked at what brands a smoker smoked earlier?

A    Occasionally, yes.

Q    Typically, you're not asked to do that. You're asked to look at the industry.

Page 4313 MR. FURR:  Right.  I think that what

Mr. Gdanski is trying to do is elicit from

Dr. Proctor that he understood that the original

class action had a previous 700,000 members or

something like that.  That's been excluded.  You

can't tell this jury any more about the Engle

case other than what the findings are.  So

however many people were involved in the class

action is simply not relevant to any issue in

this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know why that's been excluded, or if it ever has been.  I am not familiar with that ruling, that it's ever been excluded.  Dr. Proctor can talk about the scope of the size of this class and this group that he has to travel from case to case testifying on. I am trying to explain why it is he travels case to case.

THE COURT:  What's the importance of that?

MR. GDANSKI:  The importance of it is, A, it goes to the scope of the harm caused by tobacco companies.  It's over a magnitude of several hundred thousand.  And B, it goes to the point of why Dr. Proctor has to make the money he made, which is substantial -- they're going

he has to go case to case to case testifying. THE COURT:  At this point, I'm going to

sustain the objection.  You should not ask that

or reference the number of people in the class.

I don't find that there's much relevance to it.

It's probably more prejudicial than relevant. The other thing is, if they open up the

door to it, depending on how they impeach him on

how much money he makes, that may open up the

door to some evidence as to, you know, the

extent of his work on Engle cases.

But for right now, I'm going to sustain the

objection. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Okay.  So this says that 58 percent of smokers responded that filters reduce the health risks in cigarette smoking. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Is that consistent, Dr. Proctor, with what you've seen in your studies done of smokers over time?

A    Yes.

Page 4316 on the air pollution is higher than 20 � how smokers

will sometimes have a greater degree of confusion

when it comes to the true harms associated with

cigarettes?

A    Well, first of all, there are comparisons between the smokers and the nonsmokers.

Q    Yes, sir, you're right.

A    So 30 percent of the smokers agree that air pollution is the major cause of lung cancer, and only 14 percent of the nonsmokers.  It's just -- it's --consistently throughout this period smokers are more poorly informed.  It makes sense when you figure that, as people become informed, they start quitting. They peel out of that group.

Q    How does the self-rational, the sort of � the cognitive dissonance, where you can convince yourself of something if you want to believe that something is true, how does that relate to smokers and the denials?

Page 4320 limited purpose, correct?

A    Yes, it was not an everything conspiracy.

Q   You agree that the essence of the conspiracy, as you understand it, related to an agreement between the companies to deny that cigarettes are dangerous and addictive, correct?

A    Yes.  That was the principal thrust of the agreement.

Q    Sir, you've seen no evidence demonstrating that the cigarette companies entered into any type of agreement with respect to developing and marketing filtered cigarettes as a health reassurance product, correct?

A    The only way that really fits into it is the agreement required that they could not say filters were safer because that would be admitting that other cigarettes were not so.

Now -- or that were dangerous, I should say.

So there -- but it's true, as I think you're saying, the companies separately were marketing and developing filters.

Q    Each company of course hoped to obtain the largest market share that it could, correct?

A    Yes.  They're competitors for market share.

Page 4321 They're collaborators on denial of health effects.

Q    Let me make it simple for you to answer. There was no agreement between the companies where they got together and said let's develop filtered cigarettes and market them in a way that fools consumers, correct ?

A    I think that's fair, yeah.  There are important conspiracy aspects that govern what they can say about filters, but the idea of developing filters, that goes way back actually before the conspiracy.

Q    Similarly, with respect to developing and marketing low tar cigarettes and light cigarettes and ultra light, for that matter, would you agree that you have seen no documents reflecting an agreement between the companies to develop low tar, light and ultra light cigarettes as a health reassurance product ?

A    I think that's generally true, with the qualification only that there are certain things that could or could not be said about low tars and lights, given the conspiracy.

Q    And again, you're referring to the companies were not going to refer to them as safer out of concern that you believe they were concerned

other products were not safe?

A    Were not safe, that's correct.

Q    There were no agreements, for example, between R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris to, hey, let's develop and market light and low tar cigarettes in an effort to fool consumers into thinking they're safer.  No such agreements?

A    Yes, I think that's generally true.  The development of them is fraudulent, but in a way it's kind of separate parallel frauds.

Q    As opposed to a conspiracy?

A    As opposed to a conspiracy, just in that one narrow respect.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Let's first explain one technical issue for the benefit of the Court.  This is a Marlboro Red, cigarette, okay.  It's got a filter on it, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Is a Marlboro Red cigarette with a filter a form of a light and low tar cigarette?

Page 4323 aspects of reassurance built into it in its

representation.  The very fact that it has a filter

implies safety via things likely low tar.  So there's

a lot of overlap in the categories low tar, filter,

light.  They're all essentially the same type of

reassurance, implying safety by delivering less of

the bad stuff into your lungs.

So in that sense, those things are all

similar.

Q    In the ways in which the tobacco companies marketed and sold filtered, lights and low tar cigarettes, is this Marlboro Red cigarette with a filter in those ways and in that context a version of a lighter low tar cigarette?

A In that sense, yeah. It's part of a false reassurance design, designed to make consumers think they're safer.

Q    As it relates to the fraud and the conspiracy, you understand they're separate Engle findings, one for fraud and one for conspiracy?

A    Yeah.  I don't really know a lot of details about that.

Q    As it relates to the perpetuation of fraud by the tobacco companies, was there a fraud committed by the tobacco companies to lie to the public about

Page 4324 whether or not filtered cigarettes and light

cigarettes and low tar cigarettes did actually reduce

the risk for contracting disease?

A    I think that's true.  Yeah, they did.

Q In furtherance of the conspiracy, so as part of the conspiracy, did the tobacco companies deny that cigarettes were harmful?

A    Yes.

Q    Also in furtherance of the conspiracy, did they claim that while they don't accept the idea that there's anything wrong with cigarettes, to the extent there is, a filter or a light or a low tar would remove anything harmful?

A    Yeah.  They said that in collective representations.  We've seen several of them already in the past few days.  Howard Cullman goes on national television saying that filters remove certain tars and nicotine.  Philip Morris in its submission to the Surgeon General says it's possible to selectively filter.  So they jointly did make representations about the filters.

Q   Were the same representations � as the market started to grow from just filters to also lights and low tars, were there representations about filters, lights and low tars �

filters, lights and low tars?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, unless the Judge asks me

to.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain.  Compound

question.  Please break it up. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Here is the point:  Can you break up � I mean that's the whole point, Dr. Proctor.  Can you break up the conversation of the historical record and separate lights from low tars from filters when you're trying to describe the scope of the fraud and how the tobacco companies lied to the public about which cigarettes were safer and which ones weren't?

A    No.  It goes all the way back to toasting, king size, filters, menthol, low tars, lights, ultralights, naturals, organics, and additive frees. Those are all fraudulent representations of safety. You've only been talking about three of them, but there are actually numerous.

Q    So if you wanted to explain to the jury the totality of the story of how the tobacco companies as part of their conspiracy provided reassurance to the public, would you need to explain the history of the filtered story?

Page 4326 A    It would be helpful, yes.

Q    Would you want to and would it be helpful to explain the marketing of lights, low tar, all natural, organic cigarettes?  Is that necessary to explain the totality of the story as it relates to the providing smokers with doubt and a psychological crutch?

A    It's important if you're interested in the whole truth.

Q    Is there � is that � I guess, can you tell the whole truth of the fraud by the tobacco company but also leave out the part about lights and low tar cigarettes?

A    No, no.  The light and low tar is a key part of the fraud.  I mean I can do it.  I'll do anything the Judge tells me to.

Q    It can be left out, but it would be historically dishonest.

A    I think it would be better to have the story told.

Q    Did filtered cigarettes ultimately turn into and create a larger market share for lights and low tar cigarettes?

A    Yes, yes.  Lights and low tars really piggyback on the filter idea.  All of those terms

Q    When it comes to cigarette design, and when it comes to explaining how and to what degree the tobacco companies can control and manipulate the design of cigarettes, is it important to understand how they do so in constructing lights and low tar cigarettes?

A    Yes.  With the proviso that those are trivial designs.  Those are really illusions. They're not really fundamentally designs.  They're gimmicks.

Q    Sure.  Let me rephrase it, then, to satisfy the concern.

When it comes to exposing the gimmicks put on to cigarettes by tobacco companies and the design parameters surrounding those gimmicks and those illusions, do you need to be able to explain the features of those design gimmicks for lights, low tars, ventilation holes, lighter tobacco, less weight in the rod, all of that?

A    Those are helpful, yeah.

	No, no, not technically.  This is a

Marlboro

of cigarettes, Marlboro Reds?

A
	Marlboros came out earlier in the 20th

3
	A    Right.  Well, you blended two things.

4
	There's no such thing as a light cigarette because a

	light cigarette is a branding concept that begins in

6

7
	Q          Right.

8
	A    There were low tar cigarettes meaning that

9
	cigarettes that on machines produced less tar.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm just following up on the

want to know the whole truth.  I'm just

May I proceed, Your Honor?

truth, if the Court wants to know the entire story,

there's different discrete stories you can talk

about, right ?

truth?  I don't know what he's talking about.  I

object.  That's argumentative.  This has nothing

to do with it.  It's compound.  It's an

absolutely inappropriate and an illogical

question.

Right?

All I'm saying is that whole story may apply to some smokers more than it applies to others, right ?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  That's irrelevant and that's -- and the concept of the whole story only applying to some people undermines the concept of the whole story.  I object. THE COURT:  Overruled.

You're saying that the whole story involves a lot of things, and you would acknowledge at the end of the day it's the Court's job to decide what applies and doesn't apply in a particular case.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    I want to just clear up something,

Dr. Proctor, about any ambiguity.  Let's make this

crystal clear.

Filtered cigarettes, are they a form of low

tar cigarettes?

A    They are -- there is a kind of overlap in

similarity there, yes.  They're both part of the

deception.

Q    For example, I'm going to hand you an ad

for Parliament cigarettes made by Philip Morris, all

right ?

I'm going to hand it to the Judge after so

he understands where we're coming from.

MR. PHILIPSON:  It's on the screen.

MR. GDANSKI:  On what screen?

MR. PHILIPSON:  On the Judge's screen.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    This is a Philip Morris advertisement for

Parliament, regular Parliaments.  There's no

descriptor on the pack, there's no term, there's no

reference to anything, just Parliament, right?

A    Yes.

Page 4337 Q    It is what you would describe as Parliament

regulars, right, what Mr. Brenner called

Parliament � Marlboro regular?

A    Sure.  It's a filtered cigarette that has the descriptor low tar in its advertising.

Q    Right.

A    It has a recessed tip as part of the gimmick.

Q    By the way, Marlboro cigarettes were never called Marlboro regular, were they?

A    Not until later.  That's more of a � they're usually called Marlboro Red.

Q    Were they ever in any pack called Marlboro regular?

A    I've never seen that on a pack.

Q    Here is the point:  When Philip Morris marketed Parliaments that didn't have any descriptors of light or low tar in their advertising, would they market them as a low tar cigarette?

A    Yes, that's a descriptor.

Q    Is that because of the filters?

A   Well, they do have so-called filters.

Q    I'm not asking the truth of the science behind the filter.  I'm saying from their perspective in the marketing of the product.  Forget the

In the marketing of the product did they

market it as a low tar cigarette because it had a

filter?  Was that what was going on in the marketing

of the product?

A    That sounds a little bit of a strange way to put it.

Q    You tell us.

A    They're both features of a cigarette being represented as safer by virtue of, A, having a filter, and, B, delivering low tar.  Those are the bragging aspects of the cigarette that are intended to be safer.

Q    Is there only one � when it comes to the story of the tobacco companies, not any one particular smoker, when it comes to the story of the tobacco companies, is there one large story that you can tell?

A    You can tell one and you can tell many.

Q    Are you prepared to tell one large one?

A    I can do one large one or many small ones.

Q    Okay.  Do you think it should include a discussion about lights and low tar cigarettes?

MR. BRENNER:  We're joining your objection

Mr. Proctor's opinion.

MR. BRENNER:  Dr. Proctor, yes.  If he

wants to answer, Judge. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    The point is, Dr. Proctor, is it an important part of the historical context, lights and low tars?

A    It's a very important part of the fraud,

yes

MR. GDANSKI:  I think that � I think Dr. Proctor said what he has to say on the issue.  If Your Honor want us to argue it, I'm happy to do it.

THE COURT:  Well, I think based on what I've heard and weighing everything from a 404 perspective on prejudicial, the fact that there's no evidence that this smoker has -- this case involves low tars or -- what is it low tars -- what is it �

MR. FURR:  Lights.

THE COURT:  � light cigarettes.  Low tars and light cigarettes.  The witness, when he was voir dired, gave no -- said there was no conspiracy, no evidence of any specific conspiracy to commit any fraud.  So there's

statements he says where he throws in the word

"fraud," but he doesn't back it up with anything

when he was examined by the defense.  His

answers were very inadequate on that topic.

So I just think that the prejudice and the confusion to the jury on this case is so outweighed by any possible remote relevance to it that I'm going to exclude the low tars and the light cigarettes at this time.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I asked him a direct question, the following question --

THE COURT:  He just said a very general statement.  These questions were very, very --again, it's very remote.  He said � Doctor, didn't you say that you had no evidence of any conspiracy between the tobacco companies on this low tar issue?

THE WITNESS:  I said there's a part that's linked to it and a part not linked to it.  So �

THE COURT:  What's the evidence of the conspiracy?  What agreement did they have?  What collusion did they have?

THE WITNESS:  They had an agreement never to say any cigarette was safer than --

THE COURT:  Okay.  What was the collusion or the agreement regarding low tars and lights �

THE WITNESS:  Well �

THE COURT:  � specifically?  Not about cigarettes in general.  I want to know about low tars and lights.

THE COURT:  Well �

MR. GDANSKI:  I asked him the following question:

Was the concept of lights and low tars another step in the long-term fraud and conspiracy to hide the health effect and addictive nature of cigarettes?

His answer was unequivocally yes.

defense -- does the defense want to

cross-examine him on this question that he just

said about some machines?  Because I didn't hear

anything about that before.

MR. FURR:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Go ahead.  I'm about ready to

bring out the jury because we're going to waste

all of this time here when I have a jury sitting

here and I have to send them home at 5:30.

MR. FURR:  Yes, I am ready to do that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I have, Your Honor, an exact

motion today denied on the same exact issue in

Broward County, same exact witness who will be

handling the issue, same exact evidence.

Everything is the same except the order.

THE COURT:  Ask him about these machines.

I don't know anything about that.

Q    Can you tell the Judge when those machines were developed?

A    They were developed originally in 1927 in Germany, and then improved or revised in 1935 in the United States.

Q    Those machines were not developed as part of any fraudulent conspiracy by the tobacco companies to manufacture and market low tar and light cigarettes; isn't that correct? A    That's correct.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    It says, The program must be massive.  We estimate that the pressure of the clearinghouse in media terms exceeds $60 million a year.

What are they referring to there?

A    They're referring to the governmental effort to caution about some of the harms of smoking.

Q    So after Tiderock started working with the tobacco companies, did they help to reestablish the cigarette controversy?

A    Yes.

Q   Was there a magazine that existed back then that doesn't exist anymore called True magazine?

A    Yes.

Q    What was True magazine?

A    It was the most popular men's magazine circulating over 3 million copies per month.

Q    Did True magazine have stories on cigarettes?

A    It did.

Q   Were they put there because tobacco companies got them there?

A    At least one was.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, this is the very same 1967 FTC report that Your Honor will remember we talked about with Dr. Figlar's deposition.  We started talking about ancient documents and opinion testimony.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. EDSON:  The first one that we looked at was the 1967 FTC report.  What they want to get in is an opinion by the FTC that cigarettes --that the warning labels on cigarettes were ineffective.  This is directly an opinion by the FTC, and they want to offer it for the truth. This is not a factual statement.  It's an opinion.  I can look at the document.  I believe we looked at this in more detail, Your Honor, but we can look at it specifically.

truth of the matter asserted?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's being offered to prove two different things.  One, it's offered to prove notice as to historically what was taking place and as to cigarette's labeling and why changes in labeling was reguired.  Changes in labeling were reguired because certain labels were not effective and enough and that's why they had to change it.  So it goes to the historical story as to why labels were changed over time.

Two, it goes to prove a factual �

Page 4350 whether or not the caution label, which is not

preempted, this is pre-1969, it goes to notice

as to whether or not the caution label was

sufficiently warning people.  It goes to

Mr. Shulman's comparative fault.  It goes to

multiple issues in the case.  In 1966 a caution

statement goes on cigarettes.  Their claim is

that that was it, everybody has now been warned.

Number one, that claim is not preempted and,

number two, we can talk about historically why

there were -- changes in cigarette labeling was

required.

THE COURT:  I know, but it's a hearsay document.  The question is -- you're trying to say it's not going to the truth of the matter asserted, but it appears it might be going to the truth of the matter asserted.

MR. GDANSKI:  So when it was hearsay for the '64 Surgeon General's report Your Honor said I could talk about factually what took place as far as these reports.

THE COURT:  It was going to the issue of notice.

MR. GDANSKI:  That was not to the issue �

the cigarettes on notice of the health risks of

cigarettes.

MR. GDANSKI:  That was a different document.

THE COURT:  I know that.  That one I understood it went to notice.  This one I don't understand your argument on notice.

What's the � let me see the report. You're trying to get out of it what exactly?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm trying to get out of it the discussion they had about the impact and the effect of the 1966 caution statement on cigarettes.  There's a couple of points I need to make.

Number one, this document satisfies the government reports exception.  It is prepared directly as a report to Congress.  The very first page, the very face of the document right on the first page, says that.  Federal Trade Commission Report to Congress.  The cover, page it says -- the cover page, it says Report to Congress.  That's a government report.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a hearsay exception.

Page 4352 Government reports is a separate independent

hearsay exception.  That is a recognized

exception to hearsay, a government report.

That's number one.

THE COURT:  But it has to be under seal.

MR. GDANSKI:  Under seal?

THE COURT:  Do you have this under seal?

MR. GDANSKI:  Under whose seal?  That's not even an objection they've raised.

THE COURT: That's a rule � the rule says that a government report comes in if it's under seal.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's no authenticity objection to it.  No one is claiming it's not authentic.  It's clearly a government -- this is clearly a report the Federal Trade Commission issued at that time.

THE COURT:  That comes in from an authentication perspective, but I'm not sure there is a hearsay exception.

MR. GDANSKI: There is a hearsay exception to government reports.  It's in Ehrardt.

THE COURT:  Let me see the evidence.  I don't want to see Ehrhardt on this.

about, factual findings or opinions of an

agency.  There are two things within the rule.

This is the Lee case from the Florida Supreme

Court.  There are two things that come.  There

is the agency's activities and matters observed

pursuant to a duty of law.  This is an opinion

of the agency.  It doesn't come in under either

of those.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is a matter observed pursuant to the duty of law.  Look at the first page.  It says, Report to Congress.  The FTC has to issue reports to Congress.  If they didn't, they would be in violation of the law.  The Surgeon General has to issue Surgeon General's reports.  If they didn't, it would be in violation of the law.  The 1966 federal cigarette labeling act is the law.  It requires issuance of the Federal Trade Commission reports.  It requires issuance of Surgeon General's reports.

What they're trying to do here is continue to create exception upon exception when they don't need to.  This comes in.  When I wanted to discuss the Surgeon General's report of 1964,

Page 4354 Your Honor said 1964 Surgeon General's report,

we can discuss factually what took place and

factual findings.  This is -- there's multiple

exceptions here.  The Evidence Code provides for

a specific exception for a government report.

This is an actual government report.  The

government entity by law is forced to and

required to create an actual report which we now

want to put into evidence.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, it has a very specific exception for government reports and it doesn't apply to this.  Your Honor already ruled on this exact document when we were arguing the Figlar �

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor said when it comes time to introduce it into evidence, I should lay my predicate so what happened with deposition does not happen.  And now I've laid all this and we are arguing the issue.

THE COURT:  Anything else you want us to look at?  We're not going to take this up right now.  We'll let you know tomorrow.  Let's keep going. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Page 4355 Q    To smoke or not to smoke is still the

question, are cigarettes really hazardous to your

health, like the adage says, nobody knows.  In any

case, Americans are smoking more than ever and

curiously worrying less.

Dr. Proctor, have you reviewed this

article?

A    Yes, I have.

Q    Does it cite to scientists on the issue of smoking causing disease?

A    Yes, it does.

Q    Tell the jury about that.

A    There are 14 authorities cited in that article, scientific medical authorities, all of them say there's no evidence smoking causes cancer.  And I researched them and 13 of the 14 are clearly paid by the industry, and none of that is disclosed in the article itself.

Q    If you read this article, would you have any idea that the scientists are paid off by the industry?

A    No, you would not.

Q    Do you see the author, Science, Stanley Frank?

A    Yes.

Page 4356 Q    Who is Stanley Frank?

A    He was a sportswriter.

Q    Is he someone with a scientific background competent enough to write an article on smoking causing deadly disease?

A    No.

Q    Was he paid to write this article by any company or entity?

A    Well, he was paid, but he didn't really � he wasn't the only one writing it.  The Tobacco Institute and Tiderock were writing it.

Q    Who wrote the words?

A    It's a mixture of Stanley Frank and people at Tiderock and the Tobacco Institute.

Q   Was the article ever reproduced?

A    Yes, it was.

Q    Where?

A    It was reprinted in a varied form in the National Inquirer.

Q    Who wrote it there?

A    Well, the same people wrote it, but the author is listed as Charles Golden.

Q    Who is Charles Goldman?

A    He doesn't exist.

Q   What does that mean?

story in a nationally read newspaper telling people

that it isn't true that smoking causes disease?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the tobacco industry create a fictitious author?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they plant a story in a newspaper or a periodical?

A    Actually, in two periodicals.

Q    They did it under the guise of reputable scientists saying that smoking doesn't cause disease?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, what was the impact of this?  What happened?

A    Well, it was a scandal.  It was exposed in the Washington � in the Wall Street Journal.  There are congressional discussions of it.  It leads to a certain embarrassment.  It's one of the things that led to that power struggle I mentioned between Hill &

Knowlton was embarrassed by this study being in the

then it is responded to the Tobacco Institute as

well.

Q    You know, did the tobacco industry know, Dr. Proctor, that as early as 1968 their position in the cigarette controversy was ultimately subject to a charge and finding that they were intentionally making false and misleading statements?

A   Yes, to sell the cigarettes.  That's a direct quote from one of the memos inside the Tobacco Institute responding to this exposed scandal. MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2130. MR. FURR:  No objection. THE COURT:  It will be admitted into

evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT2130 was admitted into evidence.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    So this is from William Kloepfer.  Who was that?

A    He was vice president for public relations at the Tobacco Institute in Washington.

Q    This is an internal memorandum, right?

A    Yes.

cigarettes.

Did they know full well what they were

doing?

A    Yes.

Q   Did they intentionally continue to do it?

A    They did it.

Q   Dr. Proctor, could they have stopped, could they have quit at any time?  1968 or before or after that, could they have quit making false and misleading statements?

A    Of course.

Q   Would lives have been saved?

A    Yes.

Q   Instead, did they choose to continue to make false and misleading statements?

A    They did.

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the tobacco companies have multiple opportunities to tell the truth?

A    Yes.

Q   Did they take advantage of that?

A    No.

Q    One of the things you mentioned last week was the idea of doubt is our product.  Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    That came from a tobacco company document.

A    Yes.

Q    Tell us about that.

A    That's from Brown & Williamson in 1969. Part of this turning point here when the conspiracy's becoming stronger, more aggressive, they make that expression explicit, that doubt is our product.  We really can only sell cigarettes if we keep selling ignorance.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 718.  We move that into evidence.

MR. FURR:  This falls in the same category of documents Your Honor has under consideration. THE COURT:  We'll defer on that.  Let's

Q   What were tobacco and health research reports, procedural memos, tobacco and health procedural memos?

A    There's only one procedural memo.

Q    What was that?

A    The tobacco and health reports were produced on a regular basis by the Tobacco Institute beginning in 1958 and sent to every doctor in the country.  And then in 1969 there's procedural memo governing the types of headlines that are supposed to be included and the types of stories that were supposed to be included in the tobacco and health reports.

Q Okay. So do you have � have you seen and can we show the jury the tobacco and health research procedural memo which describes the types of stories to be included in these?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 1941.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's admitted into

evidence without objection. (Exhibit PT1941 was admitted into evidence.)

Q    So what were these?  What were the tobacco and health research reports?

A    As I mentioned, these were newsletters put together by the Tobacco Institute and sent to every doctor in the country, essentially blaming something besides smoking.  The day you're born, your parents, your genetics, your occupation, all kinds of things.

Q   Did the tobacco companies, as part of the research reports that they put out, did they try to make sure that they can blame anything but cigarettes for disease?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Did the tobacco companies in the procedural reports � sorry.

Did the tobacco companies in the tobacco and health research reports, did they intentionally look to find things that could cause cancer other than cigarettes?

A    That was the whole point of the alternative causation part of the conspiracy.

Q   And here we see what's � it says criteria

Page 4363 for collection.  What are they referring to?

A    They're referring to the type of articles that would appear in the newsletters sent to every doctor.

Q    One was a report in which statistics of smoking associated disease are questioned, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they, through their witnesses, through the Committee of Counsel and Ad Hoc Committee find witnesses who would question the relationship between disease and smoking?

MR. FURR:  Okay.  Leading.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What did � as it relates to finding statistics that smoking associated diseases � questioning the statistics associated with smoking associated disease, how did that interplay would finding medical witnesses to testify?

A    They funded special projects on this topic. The special projects were both used to get cigarette friendly publications, but also to recruit witnesses for litigation.

Q    It says, One in which death certificates or classifications of such disease are questioned.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   As part of the fraud, were the tobacco companies successful in doing and implementing what was laid out in the tobacco health research procedural memo?

A    Yes.

Q Were they successful in convincing people that it wasn't cigarettes that caused disease, that it was something else as part of their fraud?

Q    What are we looking at here?

A    These are some examples from the newsletter that was sent to every doctor in the country for about 12 years.  These are from 1963.

Verdict unproved, on the left there? Lung specialists cites 28 reasons for doubting cigarettes-cancer link.  This one is based on a Dutch study, March birth lung cancer link.  In other words, it's not smoking, it's if you're born in March you become vulnerable to lung cancer because your mother was pregnant during those winter months when she didn't eat enough fruits and vegetables.  So this led to a predisposition for you to get lung cancer as a result of faulty nutrition.

Or here, Occupational Tie In Lung and Gastric Cancers.  It's where you work that causes cancer and not smoking.  There are hundreds of these.

Q    Exactly.

Who are they sent to again?

A    Every doctor in the country.

Q    Into the 1970s and rounding out the 1960s, at any point in time did the tobacco companies ever publically say, hey, smoking causes disease, we accept smoking is addictive?

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    In 1971 is there another example where the

CEO of Philip Morris � you know what I forgot, to

read those documents into evidence.

We move into evidence the underlying

tobacco and health research reports which is 2875,

2876 and 2883.

MR. FURR:  No objection to those documents.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Those are admitted into

evidence without objection.

Q    So in the 1970s, did the companies have

their spokespeople go on TV to talk about whether or

not smoking was dangerous, what was proven, all in

furtherance of their longstanding plan?

A    They did.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not doing 30 minutes.

MR. BRENNER:  In that 30 minutes of interviews there's one particular clip -- I'm going to paraphrase it -- where Mr. Cullman is asked about a study that's come out that says that cigarette and � cigarette smoking by pregnant women causes low birth weight in babies.  He rather flippantly and sort of obnoxiously says some women prefer smaller babies.

So I don't object to this clip.  I object to the smaller babies clip as being entirely overly prejudicial.  There's no relevance to it.

At this point, Mr. Shulman is 51.  He's not a woman.  He's not pregnant.  It's just to inflame the jury.

So I'd ask Mr. Gdanski, if he intends �

THE COURT:  How old did you say he was?

MR. BRENNER:  Mr. Shulman at this point is 51, he's not pregnant, nor will he ever be pregnant and this clip is just to inflame the jury, to have a Philip Morris executive �

THE COURT:  At the time of this thing?

MR. BRENNER:  Yeah, at the time.

Page 4370 THE COURT:  You got me confused.

MR. BRENNER: Judge, that particular clip is unduly prejudicial and there's no relevance to the case at all.

The other stuff that he talks about, which is smoking and health-type issues, I think, are fair game and he can go into it.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not unduly prejudicial. It's a statement by a party opponent, the CEO of Philip Morris, speaking on national news in furtherance of the conspiracy, in furtherance of their decisions as part of their denial that smoking causes disease.  This is the heart.  It might be irrelevant as --

THE COURT:  I'm going to have to look at it to determine if it's overly prejudicial.  Let's move on to something else and we'll do that at another time when I can look at it.

MR. BRENNER:  If he wants to do that, I don't object to that.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's part of a larger clip. He does say what Mr. Brenner said.  He says that some women prefer to have smaller babies.

THE COURT:  You're playing a different part of it or something?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Go ahead, Rob. (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

SPEAKER:  From CBS Washington in color, Face the Nation, a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Cullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris, Incorporated and chairman of the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.

SPEAKER:  We have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking.  We do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.  Because when and if any ingredient in cigarettes smoke is identified as being injurious to human health, we are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient.

cigarettes?

A    No.  He says there's no evidence they cause any harm.

Q    Does he admit that, you know � he says there's no evidence.  Where have we seen that earlier in tobacco company statements?

A    That's throughout the conspiracy.

Q    At the time was there � is that a true statement at the time?

cigarettes smoking causes disease.

Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q   What was the stated program, what was the publicly stated program for anybody who publicly wanted to know what the purpose of the CTR was?

A    Publicly since the Frank Statement, the representation was that the industry was honestly trying to get to the root of the guestion of whether cigarettes really caused harm.

Q    But privately they say that they're interested in denying the allegation that cigarette smoking causes disease, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Is that actually the truth?

A    That's actually the truth.

Q    Have you seen documents which discuss the three pillars of the tobacco company's conspiracy?

A    Yes.  I think more so than in later decades.

Q    Was it fair to believe that a company was acting in good faith?

A    That was commonly assumed.

Q    Is there any reason to believe that the tobacco industry would be lying and manipulating the situation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT 2050.

MR. FURR:  This was offered yesterday and excluded by the Court.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's another one.  I don't have any � that's not the case.  PT 2050 is what I'm seeking to introduce right now.

MR. FURR:  We'll have to approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  The document is littered with references to lobbying.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not true.

THE COURT:  Let's take a look at the document.

MR. FURR:  I don't have the document.

MR. GDANSKI:  In the interest of just moving things along and getting this done and then not trying to flaunt or debate Your Honor again on your ruling, which you have told me many times what it is, I'll take out the references.  I presume Your Honor is going to maintain consistency on this issue.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll take out the references to those issues and just move it along, unless Your Honor is not going to be consistent.

MR. FURR:  So what is coming out?

THE COURT:  There is a reference to the world politics there and then there is reference to more stuff further down.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    The title is "The Roper Proposal."  It's from Fred Panzer to Horace Kornegay.

Tell us who those folks were.

A    These are both people at the Tobacco Institute.  Fred Panzer was in the press office of Linda Johnson and Kornegay was his superior.

Q    It says, For nearly 20 years the industry has employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts:  Litigation � something that we've redacted � and public opinion. Do you see that?

A    I do.

Q    While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us to win important battles, it was only fair to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a vehicle for victory.  On the contrary it has always been a holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.

What is the importance of this holding strategy.

A

It's not a strategy for victory as it's a

more profits for the industry.

Q    You say it's not a strategy for victory,

but a strategy for delay.  Did the tobacco companies

essentially win by attrition, win by delay?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Argumentative. MR. FURR:  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   What actually happened?

A    What actually happened was delaying the inevitable.  The consumption of cigarettes does eventually start to fall, but the whole effect of the conspiracy was to delay that fall by decades.

Q    In delaying this and creating a holding strategy, did they outlive many of their victims? A    They did.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Sustained.  Strike the last answer.  The jury should disregard it. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   While the tobacco companies created a holding strategy, were smokers dying?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. MR. GDANSKI:  That's a fact.

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   While they had a holding strategy, did people continue to start smoking?

A    Yes.

Q   People continued to get sick?

A    Yes.

Q   People continued to die?

A    Yes.

Q   While the tobacco companies created doubt without actually denying it, did all that continue to take place?

A    That all continued.

Q   It says that they consisted of advocating the public's right to smoke without actually urging them to take up the practice, encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to resolve the question of the health hazards. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q   On the litigation front for which the strategy was designed � so is this an internal documents saying our conduct, our course of action was designed to protect against litigation?

A    Yes, that was one of the three pillars.

lost a liability case, this is not because juries

have rejected the anti-smoking arguments.

Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco companies, through their fraud and conspiracy, were they able to essentially manipulate public opinion to such a degree that it was actually able to result in favorable litigation outcomes?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative and relevance.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What's the significance of what we're looking at here where they describe how it was successful on the litigation front?

A Litigation was a principal threat to the sale of cigarettes, and they successfully thwarted litigation through the conspiracy.

Q    As part of the fraud and conspiracy, were they able to fool and con juries?

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.

A

Yes

Q    What's going on here?

A    This is the alternative causation program they're strengthening at this point.  And the two alternatives mentioned here are the constitutional hypothesis, the idea there's something wrong with your body that makes you susceptible to lung cancer, or the number two example of multifactorial hypothesis that cancer is really so complex we can't really identify anyone single major factor.  It's a complex interaction between genes and the environment and other things.  So these were two of the strategies they were exploring.

Q    Here it says, The multifactorial hypothesis.  As science advances, more and more factors come under suspicion as contributing to the illnesses for which smoking is blamed:  Air pollution, food additives, occupational hazards, and stresses.

A    Yes.

Q    Is this an internal recognition that pointing to an occupational hazard or stress or food is an aspect of the tobacco companies' efforts to mislead the public?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading, Your Honor.

Q    How did the tobacco industry use � as part of their conduct and their choices, how did they chose to use occupational hazards as a defense in litigation?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Relevance, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is their document.  This is their document.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, what possible relevance can it have for them to keep suggesting -- first of all, what possible relevance does it have what happens in an individual lawsuit 40 years ago?

This is a blatant attempt by counsel to suggest that what is happening in this document is what is happening in this courtroom.  Well, we happen to have an occupational exposure defense.  Judge, there is no possible relevance to what happened in a lawsuit 45 years ago.  It wasn't affecting the public.  He's saying they

MR. GDANSKI:  I didn't mention Texas.

MR. BRENNER:  No, no, individual lawsuits. This happened 45 years ago.

Your Honor, this is exactly what we tried to guard against, and counsel just keeps pushing the envelope and pushing the envelope and pushing the envelope, stressing the use of occupational exposures in individual lawsuits. What in the world does that have to do with it, other than to try to inflame this jury to believe that we're doing �

you with this innocent look and say he is doing

nothing of the sort, but I can't think of no

other reason why he is harping on us.

MR. GUEST:  There's been repeated references to the fact that tobacco companies are hiring expert witnesses to come into the courtroom and offer these kinds of testimony, and that the tobacco companies hired them basically fraudulently to trick juries.  And we're obviously getting expert witnesses to come into this courtroom and offer testimony on occupational hazards.  So Mr. Gdanski is clearly creating the impression that what happened 40 years ago is going to happen whenever we start putting our case on.  That's the clear implication of what he's doing right now.

MR. GDANSKI:  They're paranoid, number one. Number two, I'm reading from their document.  I didn't write this.  Forty years ago they decided to write that the principal component of their conspiracy was saying that the occupational jobs, what a person does for a living, is

THE COURT:  What is the relevance to how they defend another lawsuit?  What is the relevance of it?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's a principal component of the conspiracy.  This is their document.  It says there are three components.  One we've already taken out, legislation.  But litigation and public relations are the other two major components that they said � when you ask the question of how is it relevant, they decided it was relevant when they said there was a principal component to their conspiracy.  They can't now come in and say that which they have previously identified as a principal component of the conspiracy is no longer relevant when they sue us for conspiracy.  That's an unfair artifact that they want to use as a defense to keep out what they did, and that's unfair.

I can't change what they wrote.

THE COURT:  I understand that.  But I don't

want you to ask � I think it would be overly

occupational hazard because it's going to

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do we know from the tobacco company documents how they characterized keep all eyes on the smoker in the context of litigation?

A    Yes.

Q    And do we know that they discussed and referred to smokers who get sick as victims?

A    They do.

Q    Did they indicate that they were going to play hard ball with those victims?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and argumentative. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What did they say about what they're going to do when their victim pressed their claim in court?

A    Playing hard ball is actually a quote from one of the documents.

MR. GDANSKI:  We have that document, 5837. We'd move it into evidence.

MR. BRENNER:  May we approach one second, Your Honor?

And my wife, Peggy, who looks after all of us.  That's me, Bill Talman, with a friend of mine you might recognize.

You know, I didn't really mind losing those courtroom battles, but I'm in a battle right now I don't want to lose at all.  Because if I lose it, it means losing my wife and those kids you just met.  I've got lung cancer.  Take some advice about smoking and losing from someone who's been doing both for years.  If you don't smoke, don't start.  If you do smoke, quit. Don't be a loser. (Thereupon, the video clip concludes.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   What's the year of that?

Q    That's also one from Yul Brynner.

A Yul Brynner was a famous movie star from the Magnificent Seven, The King and I. He was the first really great ball actor.

MR. PHILIPSON:  What number was that? MR. GDANSKI:  3130.

MR. PHILIPSON:  That's not it.  Hold on a second while I look for it. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   While he's looking for it, his was actually a voice from the grave type of deal, right? A    Yes.

Q   What does that mean?

A    He recorded this cautionary statement knowing he would die soon of lung cancer, and then it was broadcast after his death.

Q    Thank you. (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Ladies and gentlemen, the late Yul Brynner.

If I could take back that smoking, we

wouldn't be talking about any cancer. (Thereupon, the video concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    He's convinced of that, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Do either of these mention the powerful nature of nicotine addiction?

A    Neither one does.

Q    What's the significance of that?

A    These are both very limited.  Even though they are powerful, they're limited.  There are many things that are not mentioned.  They don't mention the industry.  They put all the blame on the person as almost a choice really, not stressing either addiction or any responsibility by the industry.

Q    Were there also industry sponsored, Tobacco Institute sponsored television advertisements?  We won't called them PSAs because they didn't service the public.  But were there television advertisements sponsored by the Tobacco Institute to get their message across.

A    Many.

SPEAKER:  This is America today.  The pace, fast.  The competition, great.  We live with more tension, more emotion, more concern about our health, more everything than ever before.

Specifically, we would be looking to one of the more controversial aspects of modern life, tobacco and its use, particularly in cigarettes.

To help us gain new perspective on the question of smoking and health, we will hear from world-renowned scientists and experts.  No single type of cancer has provoked more questions and controversy than cancer of the lung.

SPEAKER:  Lung cancer is predominately a disease of people who live in large cities or industrial areas; whereas, people who live in rural communities have a much lower incidence of lung cancer.

SPEAKER:  Well, there are substances in the air in every city in the United States and I suspect every city in the world which are known

Page 4401 to produce cancer.

SPEAKER:  This becomes especially interesting when we recall, as Dr. William Ober has pointed out, the vast majority of cigarette smokers don't get lung cancer, while animals, who obviously don't smoke at all, do.

Dr. Herbert L. Radcliff has noted a significant increase in the frequency of lung cancer in water fowl, especially in two species of ducks at the Philadelphia Zoo, located in the typical city air pollution area.  Many persons attributed the reported rise of lung cancer to cigarette smoking.

Others, Dr. Langston, for example, question this assumption.

SPEAKER:  Cancer of the voice box is a medical disease.  It also related to smoking, yet its incidence has remained rather constant. It has not increased.  And yet everyone is talking about the marketed rise in the instance of lung cancer.

If they are both caused by the same agent, why is it that one is assumed, quote, epidemic, unquote, proportions, and the other has remained quite stable.  This is not consistent with

I cannot point to anything that I would consider the cause of cancer of the lung.  The behavior of the disease does not support the idea of cigarettes being the causal agent in the production of this disease.

SPEAKER:  About emphysema, Dr. Levine.

SPEAKER:  There are large numbers of us who have some background in this field who do not believe the evidence is sufficient for the statements that have been made.

SPEAKER:  About general statistical associations of health and smoking, Dr. Ober.

SPEAKER:  I think we have a great deal to learn.  I think far too many people are rushed to a premature judgment based on very inadequate evidence, chiefly, because of the tremendous emotional need to oversimplify and to make things easy and palatable for the public, for medical students, as well as for legislators.

Q In comparing the money spent by the tobacco industry versus the Public Health Community, who paid more to get their message out?

Q    And we have two advertisements � well, two

much shorter little clips discussing the scientific

research and discussing Lady Justice.

Are you familiar with those?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'd move both of these into

evidence, PT 526 and PT 1764. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    While they're looking, something like that, obviously, we look at it today and it looks a little bit absurd.  Back then, was it normal?

A    I'm not sure you've premised �

Q    Fair enough.

A    When he makes the comparison of laryngeal cancer, that takes explanation to understand why that's not a puzzle.

Q    Okay.  What is it?

A    The laryngeal cancer has remained constant because it's mainly caused by pipe smoking which had been fairly constant.  The lung cancer rose because of the rise of cigarettes.  So he's not reasoning properly when he acts like this is a paradox.

Q    Smoking also causes laryngal cancer, causes people to lose their voicebox, right?

SPEAKER:  You've seen those commercials against cigarette smoking.  They say that it causes all sorts of diseases, that it shortens your life, that 100,000 doctors have quit, but some of the country's most respected doctors and scientists, men recognized as experts on smoking and health, stood up in Congress and disagreed

commercials didn't mention that, did they?

Poor old justice. (Thereupon, the video clip concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  And the other one. (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

SPEAKER:  Here in Washington a lot goes on that you never hear about.  Take the controversy about cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a house committee heard testimony from leading experts on smoking and health.  The record shows that many of the country's most respected doctors openly challenged anticigarette claims.

A California doctor said, as a scientist, I find no persuasive evidence that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

A New York doctor told Congress to claim there is now sufficient scientific evidence to establish that cigarette smoking causes disease is, in my opinion, unjustified.

There is another side to the cigarette controversy.  It's all here in this white paper. Send for it. (Thereupon, the video clip concluded.)

Q   Are there other examples of these television commercials for the tobacco companies?

A    Many.

Q    Who are the two scientists that are referenced in that last one we saw?

A    In the last one it's a USC professor named Ronald Olman and a New York physician by the name of Sommers.  He was also head of the CPR Scientific Advisory Board.

Q    I guess that's the point.  Were those people neutral, independent, straight-shooting scientists?

A    No.  They were both on the payroll of the industry.

Q    Are you familiar with other television clips or commercials featuring Bill Dwyer?

SPEAKER:  It's difficult to imagine any health issues which has commanded more attention in recent years than smoking and health.

What are the contents of these charges? What is the basis for what is said and written? What is known versus what is already believed? Can we separate the fact from fancy?

Here is a graph.  It gives a general idea of lung cancer mortality.  I say general idea because this incidence line is subject to variation between men and women, among different races, and even among various geographic regions.  On the whole, lung cancer as a cause of death is on the increase.

This line, that roughly parallels the lung cancer line, plots the increasing use of cigarettes over time.  You'll note, of course, that the two lines seem to track together.  In reality, they do.  However, that observed relationship actually asks more than it answers. It really poses the question of whether one is

To this question it must be answered insofar as the correlation between lung cancer and cigarette smoking are concerned, no one knows.  It may, it may not.

As I'm sure you're aware, health alarms based on statistical studies are by no means limited to cigarettes.  The list literally goes from A to Z, from aspirin to zoo.

Two Chicago doctors implicated fresh air as a health hazard, claiming it leads to insomnia and nightmares.  Apricots have been questioned because of their cyanid component.  Betelnut chewing was linked with intestinal cancer.  Old books were cited as a source for a viral infection.  Cats and dogs are on the list, as are milk, butter, eggs, cauliflower, peanut butter, potatoes, corn, peas, brussel sprouts and spinach, to name just a few foods whose consumption has been linked with human disorder.

Sex also is on the health hazards line-up, along with wax milk cartons and Worcester sauce.

Beyond the statistical situation, there are some common sense questions one can address to those who make bold assertions about smoking and

For example, how can cigarette smoking be the cause of lung cancer if the cause of lung cancer is as of yet under known?

In fact, no one knows what causes lung cancer.  Yes, there are many theories and there is that statistical evidence 2implicating smoking that some insist is sufficient.

Yet, others believe that many factors are involved in the development of the disease, making it impossible to assign any one the sole cause.

A British physician has said the cause of cancer of the lung is not known.  We have only statistical inferences and forecasts.  Until the cause is discovered, no one who values scientific evidence should assume that cigarettes cause cancer of the lung.

Many of the health-related charges against tobacco are oversimplified.  That may tempt one to reply in kind.  But the tobacco industry prefers to deal with these issues in more than a superficial manner.  It is committed to securing reliable and objective information to help answer the questions raised about its product.

Page 4410 In addition to their own product research

and development program, the industry-supported

independent scientific research certifies that

commitment.  Cigarette companies have made and

continue to make substantial financial

contributions to scientific exploration of the

whole range of smoking and health issues.

Many of the experiments underway today in laboratories, medical schools and other research centers would not be possible but for the funding of tobacco manufacturers.  For that reason alone, science includes those who have cautioned that if smoking were not available, some smokers might exhibit increased stress.

Stress, of course, is cited in much of the scientific literature as a factor likely to be involved in human disease causation.  For that reason alone, science includes those who have cautioned that if smoking were not available, some smokers might exhibit increased stress.

I hope this brief review of a very complex subject at least helps to indicate that many open questions exist in the realm of smoking and health.  There is not unanimity of opinion in the community of science on these issues.

Page 4411 Some are convinced in one direction.

Others take an opposing view.  And still others

say that we have no business prejudging the

scientific controversy.  We need more

information.  This is the open-minded approach

the tobacco industry follows, and which it

commenced to others. (Thereupon, the video clip concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, is that exactly what they did, recommend an open-minded approach?

A    That's what they did.

Q    Did the industry internally describe the Council for Tobacco Research as a front and a shield?

A    Yes.

Q    This will be the last document we'11 look at, 2268.

MR. GDANSKI:  We'll move that into

evidence.

MS. LEHMAN:  Your Honor, this is subject to

the same category of documents that you've been

considering.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  I'll hold off.  How

about 1525?

THE COURT:  How about it's time to go home?

MR. GDANSKI:  How about you're the Judge and I agree.

THE COURT:  I think we had said we were going to go until 5:30, and it's 5:30 now.

All right.  So don't communicate with each other about the case.  Don't communicate with anybody at home or anybody else about the case. Don't do any independent research or investigation of your own.  Don't use any electronic devices regarding the case.  Don't post anything on any social web sites regarding the case.

We'll see you back at 9:25 I guess, 9:25 in the morning.  Thank you very much and we'll see you tomorrow. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  The category, it's called Bliley documents?

MS. LEHMAN:  That's correct.

MR. GDANSKI:  B-L-I-L-E-Y.

THE COURT:  Bliley.

review of them.  And be also prepared at some

point in time, I'm not sure when, that we may

have to have a short evidentiary hearing on

whether there's been a waiver or not a waiver of

those documents and whether they were part of

the settlement agreement or not part of the

settlement agreement.

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  One point of clarification:  When you say all of the Bliley documents, do you mean all of the Bliley documents on plaintiff's list?

THE COURT:  Everything that's on your privilege log.  That should have been done before trial.  I need to have them for an in-camera inspection.  I'll need to review them. I'll need them all submitted for my review.  And you should be prepared to put on some evidence on whether there's been a waiver and whether or not the waiver was voluntary or not voluntary and whether or not it's part of the settlement agreement or not part of the settlement agreement.  That should have been done before

THE COURT:  Have a seat.

MR. FURR:  With the Court's permission, we would like to begin by addressing the Bliley issue if this is the right time to do that.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Yes.

MR. FURR:  Ms. Lehman will take the lead.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  Before we do that, can I just give Your Honor a copy because, you know, it didn't jog my memory yesterday until we left court.

The Fourth District Court of Appeals in Florida, which obviously governs this Court, has ruled on this issue in the State of Florida versus the American Tobacco Company case.

MR. GDANSKI:  � and it went up on appeal.  And in the Fourth District, Judge Warner ruled clearly, clearly if Your Honor takes a look at headnote Number 11 �

MS. LEHMAN:  Could counsel provide me with a copy, please?

MR. GDANSKI:  Oh, yes.

MR. BRENNER:  Which headnote did you say?

MR. GDANSKI:  Headnote 11.

Evidence was sufficient to support the State � which was the plaintiff in that case � the State's theory of fraud, and that attorneys for tobacco companies were used to perpetuate fraud such that crime-fraud exception to attorney/client privilege existed with respect to documents that State sought to discover regarding allegations of its Complaint and that company's allegations of its Complaint that companies had engaged in fraud in covering up health risks of their product.

Page 4424 There was evidence that companies hid

health risks of smoking from the public and that

companies utilized their attorneys in carrying out

their misrepresentations.

This is obviously binding case law on this Court on this issue with these defendants.

So I think there's, you know, two problems.  Number one is why the defendants, who surely are aware of this, never brought this to the attention of the Court, which is obviously a prerequisite, and I wish we would have brought it to the Court's attention earlier.

And the second problem is how is this not dispositive of this entire issue?

MS. LEHMAN:  It's not dispositive, Your Honor, because this stands for the idea that there is a potential to apply the crime-fraud exception here, but the Court is still required to go document by document to find crime-fraud for each individual document.

And that is what this case does not do with respect to these documents.  So it is not dispositive of anything other than the fact that the crime-fraud exception can be applied.

And, in fact, there is contrary evidence

Page 4425 with respect to one of the specific documents that

we talked about yesterday, the Battelle document,

that specifically found that the crime-fraud

exception did not apply to that document.

But what I would like to �

THE COURT:  Who found that?

MS. LEHMAN:  That was the First District, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  The First District?

THE COURT:  Which First District case was that one?

MS. LEHMAN:  Hold on.  Let me pull it out for you, Your Honor.  If I may, Your Honor, I have prepared a notebook for you.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. LEHMAN:  If I may approach?

THE COURT:  Okay.  So these are all of the in camera documents?

MS. LEHMAN:  No, Your Honor, I believe plaintiff's counsel has prepared that notebook for

you

This is a notebook of the documents and

the authority that we will be reviewing today during the hearing. And the case that I just referred you to is the Brown & Williamson versus

highlighted copy of the case.

THE COURT:  Tab 17?

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. LEHMAN:  And I think �

MR. GDANSKI:  How is it possible that in this binder a case from the Fourth District Court of Appeals is not included?

THE COURT:  Well, let's not argue with each other about things like that.

MR. GDANSKI:  But this is in candor to the Court.

THE COURT:  First of all, she's in the middle of talking.  You're interrupting her.

All right.  Let's go.

MS. LEHMAN:  All right.  Your Honor, the appropriate way � I think the first inquiry that we need to make is whether these documents were, in fact, privileged.

I believe, based on your comments yesterday, that you're not really struggling with that.

If you'd like to look at each individual document, we can do that to make that inquiry.

you find that they're privileged, then we move on

to the next hurdle.

So I guess my first question to you is, Your Honor, do you need to walk document by document to determine privilege?

MR. GDANSKI:  What's �

THE COURT:  Well, where are the documents?  I thought you guys were going to give me the documents for an in camera inspection.

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, plaintiff's counsel has the notebook.

THE COURT:  Do you have a notebook for that for me?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm looking for it.  I thought you asked the defendants last night to give you that today, the documents they were alleging had Bliley issues.

THE COURT:  That's what I had asked � I had asked you guys to do that.

MS. LEHMAN:  I'll be happy to do that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Because you guys are the ones claiming the privilege, so I didn't know why you assumed the plaintiff was going to do that.

There is a much larger set of documents that would fall within Bliley category that was on Plaintiff's Exhibit list but the plaintiff has not indicated an intent to use.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So we don't need to deal with the ones that are not at issue.

the Second DCA case that you gave me?

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  And I will let you know my thoughts or ruling on it.  However, is there any evidence that the defense wants to put on � is there any witnesses that the defense wants to swear in or any other evidence that the defense wants to put on on the issue of waiver � on the issue of either privilege or waiver?

MS. LEHMAN:  While, Your Honor, we have included � we do not wish to swear a witness at the time.  We have included several affidavits in the binder that I provided with respect to waiver.

After Your Honor reviews that, if you would like us to be heard, we would be happy to explain the import of those documents within the chronology of the productions, specifically focusing on the Minnesota case, the MSA and the congressional subpoena.

MR. GDANSKI:  And we object to Your Honor taking any affidavits into account, thus they were not provided to us.  We have no ability to cross-examine those witnesses.  The witnesses

foundation for some kind of evidentiary hearing or

evidence in support of a hearing in this kind of

fashion.

THE COURT:  When can those witnesses be

here?

MS. LEHMAN:  Well, Your Honor, the affidavits are actually quite old.  They were made contemporaneous with these issues, so the witnesses are not actually available.

As for the availability of these affidavits to the plaintiffs, these were used in pleadings many years ago.  They would have been available to the pleadings � or to the plaintiffs just as they are to any parties in these lawsuits.

THE COURT:  Well, I can't � you know, I can't � generally speaking on these types of things, you need an evidentiary hearing. Affidavits are insufficient.  This is being contested by the plaintiff very heavily.

So whatever other evidence you would like to put on, I'd ask that you be prepared to put those on by � when do you need to finish with this witness?

Q.
	(BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, you

talked
	yesterday about the industry controlling

the publications which the CTR put out.
	

	Do you remember that?

A.
	Yes, limited.  I didn't talk much about

that.

Page 4440 Q.  Well, CTR was the Council for Tobacco

Research, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So then discuss it, please.  Tell the jury how the tobacco companies would control the publications from the CTR.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's cumulative.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule this one, but at some point in time, it does become cumulative. So you need to be limited to what you haven't already covered.

THE WITNESS:  It was mainly controlled through selection of only those types of research projects that would not harm the industry, would not find evidence of harm.

When evidence of harm was found by some of the studies, which I called leakage, the policy was to cut off the research for that project.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  We have evidence of that.  We move into evidence PT2211A.

MR. BRENNER:  Just a second, please.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

MR. BRENNER:  No objection. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Let's take a look at that for a moment.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. PT2211A was

received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  We don't need to see it.  It's from Philip Morris, Tom Osdene, November 1978.

It says:  CTR should fund work largely by means of contracts, thus reserving the right to control publications which might be detrimental to the industry.

Did they do that?

A.  They did that somewhat.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 3, please.

It says under Subjects to be Avoided, and, Dr. Proctor, what do we know were the subjects to be avoided?

A.  Well, among other things, any attempt to relate human disease to smoking was a topic that should be avoided.

Q.  We looked yesterday at a lengthy, somewhat lengthy, three or four-minute video clip of Bill Dwyer where he was listing off the different elements that may cause cancer other than smoking.

Q.  Was he a member of the traveling truth squad and the College of Tobacco Knowledge you talked about last week?

A.  He was.  He was part of that '70s,. '80s effort.

Q.  Did he also go on television and have press conferences, news conferences at or around the same time or before the Surgeon General would come out with reports linking smoking to disease and death?

A.  Yes, he was part of an effort to launch a preemptive strike against the 1979 Surgeon General's report.

Q.  All right.  We have a clip �

MR. BRENNER:  May we approach for one second, please?

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. BRENNER:  You're done?

It's just � the exhibit that I agreed to admit into evidence was a one-page document, and then somehow an additional page came up.

So I don't even know if it's part of the same document.  Perhaps it is.  We can deal with it later.

I just � I don't know what � I don't know what it is.  All I know is the exhibit that I have from the plaintiff is a one-page document.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Let's take a look at that.

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  It was suspect from the start. HEW Secretary Califano launched his antismoking campaign a year ago with all the zeal of a reformed sinner.

And now in an apparent attempt to bring some science to the side of his new evangelism, the former three-pack-a-day secretary told the Surgeon General:  Prepare a new report.

Its issuance and internal HEW memo said, and I quote, "would be a media event," close quote.

Turning a significant health question into a publicity stunt is an insult to serious

science.

America beware if Joe Califano ever gives up drinking or other pleasure pursuits, even the most intimate.

(Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So who is Joe Califano, and what are we looking at here with all those microphones?

A.  Joe Califano was Jimmy Carter's secretary of health, education, and welfare.  And he had helped to bring about the 1979 Surgeon General's report, and basically the tobacco industry got him fired.

Q.  In 1979 and going into the '80s, '90s, moving forward, has this industry been an extremely powerful one?

A.  Yes.

Q.  After this press conference, did the industry internally discuss and celebrate how they were able to control the situation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Have you seen documents that discuss the idea of the industry

A.  Yes.

Q.  What have you seen?

A.  Well, there was a concern not just to influence the media but to be the media, to � there was consideration of buying an entire news service.

They had a very elaborate public relations operations, but it was � it wasn't just a matter of influence.  It was very powerful control.

Q.  And did they exert and exercise that control?

A.  They did.

Q.  Do you have and are there documents after this news conference where the industry looked at its effect?

A.  Yes, the 1980 annual report of the Tobacco Institute describes what we just saw as a preemptive strike against the Surgeon General's report and describes the success of that effort in terms of capturing the main attention in all three networks, network television, basically stealing the thunder of the Surgeon General.

conference he was on.

Q.  Okay.  January 10, 1980.  Let's go to

Page Number 2, please.

As a result, some notable achievements were registered this year.  The Surgeon General's media event was preempted by an institute first-strike news conference.

For the first time in the history of the cigarette controversy, a secretary of HEW �

Health, education, welfare? A.  Yes.

Q.  � had to share the spotlight.  In fact, we won top billing that night on all networks.

Go to the bottom section.

It says:  The Federal Trade Commission reign of regulatory terror may be nearing an end, thanks to the restraining hand of the Senate Commerce Committee.

The Commission's ability to invoke the highly subjective concept of "unfairness" as an independent basis for regulating commercial advertising is under increasing attack by industry and the Congress.

And did they do that?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  When scientists � you talked about CTR and some of their research and not wanting to link human disease to smoking.

Internally when scientists were conducting studies that could show powerful effects of nicotine, did the industry respond by stopping?

A.  Harold Levy was one of the psychopharmacology researchers at Philip Morris looking at nicotine addiction and things like that.

Q.  It says:  I have given Carolyn approval to proceed with this study.  If she is able to demonstrate, as she anticipates, no withdrawal effects of nicotine, we will want to pursue this avenue with some vigor.

Dr. Proctor, did the tobacco companies want to find research which refuted the public health claims and supported their claims?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If, however, the results with nicotine are similar to those gotten with morphine and caffeine, we will want to what?

A.  To bury it.

supports that individual in making that decision.

And I have to disagree with you in that we don't know what causes the ailments that have been attributed to cigarette smoking.

Certainly I am not denying the fact that cigarette smoking could be a risk factor involved with some people and some of the problems that they might have, but I don't think that there is a causal relationship established between cigarette smoking and any disease.

If there were, Diane, I don't think there would be a cause without the effect or the effect without a cause, and we all know that that happens.

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What does that mean, there can't be an effect without a cause or a cause without an effect?

A.  Well, that would be like saying that driving drunk can't cause traffic accidents because some people drive drunk and don't have an accident and some traffic accidents are not caused by people driving drunk.

So it's an illogical philosophastry that

cancer because of a very strange definition of

causation.

Q.  And, Dr. Proctor, in thinking about it and looking back at something like this that appears on TV in 1993, do we know from the documents why the tobacco companies were going on TV saying these things?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why was that?

A.  To �

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did they change their course at all in the 1980s?

A.  No, they did start talking about risk factors.  They started using some risk factor language in order to dispute causation, but basically the whole program is pretty much the same.

Q.  Do we have a demonstrative that demonstrates the amount of money tobacco companies were putting in on a yearly basis, whether it was increasing or to demonstrate how much money was

VOICE:  Earlier this week, the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company took out this ad in a number of major newspapers and magazines, calling for an open debate about smoking.

In brief, the ad contends that medical studies which show that cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring significant evidence to the contrary.

VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause cancer, yes or no?

VOICE:  It is not known whether cigarettes cause cancer.

VOICE:  All right, sir.

VOICE:  It has not been causally established.

cigarette smoking and heart disease?

VOICE:  No.  As a matter of fact, there

are studies that while we are accused of being

associated with heart disease, there have been

studied conducted over 20 years that would say

again that science is still puzzled over these

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  It's argumentative.  There's no possible relevance to any answer this witness can give.

His answer is either going to be because he feels obligated to do it because of the knowledge he has or because the defendants continue to defend these cases or because there are so many cases, or some variation thereof.

It's obvious. I'm trying to explain why �

What are you going to explain, that he � that he � that he morally likes to do this? Is that what you're going to want to tell the jury?

MR. GDANSKI:  Not at all, no.  It's nothing to do with morally.  It's that there's a lot of cases, and he has to go testify in 100, and each one he makes $1,000, and you multiply it by 100.

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  And in each case, obviously you charge for your time and they take your deposition in many, many, if not all cases, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You charge them for the deposition that you have to give as well?

Q.  And are there other cases that Mr. Furr has asked you questions in as well?

MR. GUEST:  Of course

There's no exception for the hearsay that Mr. Gdanski is eliciting right now, not a co-conspirator, not a defendant in this case.

This document, and this line in particular, he's been routinely excluded in these cases.

THE COURT:  It's not a party in this � it's not a party in this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not true.  This is a document that comes from British American Tobacco Company files, but it's from a meeting had between British American Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson.

Brown & Williamson is a party in this case.  British American Tobacco Company owned Brown & Williamson.

And they had a meeting about cigarettes,

MR. GUEST:  The bottom line, Your Honor, British American Tobacco, not a defendant in the case, regardless of the corporate structure, never a defendant in the case.

And the statement that Mr. Gdanski is talking about is from a British American Tobacco person.  There's a document, and I can hand it to Your Honor �

THE COURT:  It's not a statement by �

MR. GUEST:  Brown & Williamson or any defendant in this case, Your Honor.  And it is highly prejudicial as well.

THE COURT:  Do you have a copy of the document?

MR. GUEST:  I do.

MR. GDANSKI:  It is a statement from a meeting, a seminar held, where Brown & Williamson is there.  They are present at the seminar.

THE COURT:  Well, they may be present, but what does that mean?

MR. GDANSKI:  It means that they are there and present.

MR. GUEST:  It means nothing.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What was the tobacco

industries' paramount concern, Dr. Proctor?

A.  Money.

Q.  Thank you.

So we talked peripherally and briefly

about cigarettes and the design of cigarettes.

Are there four stages to the industry's

understanding of cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What are they?

A.  Well, it starts off as a tobacco

industry.  It moves into becoming a cigarette

industry.

Later it becomes that they're really

selling smoke, and eventually it becomes

essentially a nicotine industry.

You realize they're selling a single

drug.

Q.  And ultimately, does the industry

capitalize on the understanding that they are

truly just selling nicotine?

Page 4478

A.  Yes.

Q.  How do they do that?

A.  Well, it becomes more of a defined interest.  They didn't like the fact that it was causing cancer, so they just focus on this single addictive molecule.

Q.  Could the industry have made a safer cigarette?

A.  Yes, easily.

Q.  Tell the jury about that, please.

A.  Well, cigarettes are much more dangerous than other forms of tobacco use.  Cigars, for example, cause very little lung cancer because they're typically not inhaled.

If the industry had simply made uninhalable cigarettes the way almost all tobacco was prior to the 19th century, there would be no lung cancer epidemic, there would be no COPD, emphysema epidemic.

There are many ways to design.  The most important would be to make cigarettes uninhalable and not addictive by taking out the nicotine.

Nicotine is easy to take out, the nicotine from cigarettes.

Q.  During the �

Page 4479 A.  People would have to the freedom to

choose.  They would smoke for choice rather than

addiction.

Q.  During the manufacturing process of the cigarettes that we have commercially sold today and over the last decade, do they use reconstituted tobacco?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is reconstituted tobacco?

A.  It's a form of recycling, in a sense, and a cost saving where they sweep up all the scraps and tobacco dust and stems and leaves from the floor and make the � grind these up and make it into a slurry paste and plate it out on to 12-foot wide bands and then chop this up into little strips.

So a lot of the little strips you see in a cigarette are actually reconstituted tobacco, ground up and processed into a form of paper.

Q.  And during the process of manufacturing of reconstituted tobacco, is nicotine removed?

A.  Yes, all the solubles are removed and then sprayed back on.

Q.  That was the next question.

Does the industry choose, after removing

Page 4480 the nicotine from reconstituted tobacco, to spray

them back on in precise, controlled parameters?

A.  Yeah, that's one of the ways the industry achieves controlled � it's called precision manufacturing.

Q.  What is that?  What is precision manufacturing?

A.  Well, it just means that every cigarette has very precise specifications, typically the two decimal points for the weight of nicotine in the rod of any cigarette.

There are dozens of specifications, porosity, opacity of the paper, you know, pressure drop, how hard it is to puff on the cigarette, the weight, the bleaching, the hundreds of additives that go into cigarettes historically.

So all of these things are precisely controlled.

Q.  All right.  Are cigarettes ultimately highly-designed products?

A.  Yes, tens of billions of dollars have been spent on cigarette design within the industry since the 1940s.

First, under the Flavorings heading, which is the top right-hand corner, I object to the language at the end of it, the argumentative language, "especially kids," that is tacked on to it.  That's just a pure argument.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  So I object to the "especially kids."

I believe also the Court has not yet ruled on the issue with respect to ammonia and whether this witness is permitted to testify with respect to the effects of nicotine � of ammonia enhancing delivery of nicotine.

That has not been ruled upon.  It's reserved.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor ruled that he could testify on cigarette design, so I thought that covered ammonia, and now �

THE COURT:  No, no, we haven't � ammonia was clearly separate in that.  We always said that you can talk about the fact that ammonia is added to it, but that � but that ammonia increases the addiction, I think is the � isn't that the issue?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Take out ammonia.

This is just a demonstrative.  I don't need to let you use it.  I have discretion on this.

THE COURT:  Adding ammonia compound is okay?

MR. FURR:  That's already in evidence.

A.  Well, they use cocoa, cocoa-related products, cocoa husks, theobromine.

Q.  What's theobromine?

A.  It's one of the constituents of cocoa that's a bronchodilator.

Q.  Who has total control over how much cocoa powder to add to cigarettes?

A.  The manufacturer.  It's part of the specifications.

Q.  And what exactly is a bronchodilator?  I don't know if I asked that.

A.  Yes, 90 percent of all licorice actually goes into cigarettes.  Licorice is mainly a product used for cigarettes.

Q. So what's so bad about adding licorice or high fructose corn syrup because some people eat those every day �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase it.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Are these � are cigarettes food products?

A.  No, they're products that are added � the difference is they're inhaled.  So even a product that might be safe to eat is dangerous to inhale.

You don't � you know, it's safe to eat pistachio nuts, but you wouldn't want to inhale pistachio nuts or broccoli or anything.  The lungs are very sensitive.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was there a time where cigarette companies had open visitations to factories?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do they, today, let people come in and visit the factory?

THE COURT:  When you start introducing generally � or how cigarettes were manufactured as opposed to whether or not it's manufactured at one of the defendants' facilities, if it comes in for that purpose, what would be your objection to foundation?

MR. FURR:  Well, if it were being used as a demonstrative, I would not have made this objection, but he's seeking to introduce it as substantive evidence.

We know that it's Philip Morris, but it doesn't matter.  He testified it's from � he did testify it's from one of these defendants in a court-ordered litigation.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, again, the witness has testified, and we've allowed him to testify, you've allowed him to testify that � in fact, he just did a few minutes ago, that ammonia increases the potency of the nicotine.

And we'll cross him on that, and it will be whatnot.  But, again, he slipped in this term "free-basing nicotine," which I've never heard the term "free-basing" used other than for crack cocaine and as an analogy that plaintiff's lawyers like to use to try to analogize nicotine to crack

Page 4506 cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q. Okay. And what's the freeing process, without using the term the judge said you can't use?

A.  Well, the nicotine can exist in two fundamental states.  As a salt, nicotine tartrate, nicotine malate, nicotine formate.

There are many different forms of � it's called bound nicotine, or it can exist in a free state in which it is sort of like NH3 with ammonia.  Ammonia can exist in the same form, it's either as a salt or as a free entity, which is alkaline in nature.

And this free alkaline form of the nicotine has greater potency.  It's more poisonous, more toxic.

And so various chemicals can be added to change the nature of the molecule into either more of an alkaline state, which has greater potency, or more of a salted bound state, which is less potent.

Q.  And �

MR.   BRENNER:      Excuse  me,    objection.      And move   to   strike   the   witness's   answer  based  on   Your

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And just � can we

just go back to what's in evidence for a second,

1635, Page 6?

We looked at the document, Root

Technology, last week?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What does the root technology mean?

A.  That was the Handbook of Ammonia

Technology developed by Brown & Williamson in the

1990s as part of their leaf blenders manual,

basically how to mix tobacco and various chemicals

that go into it.

Q.  And it says here:  What Ammonia Does:

Cigarette smoke ammonia is entirely different.  It

effectively scavenges those compounds that lead to

harshness.

It  can  liberate  � what?

A.      Free   nicotine.

Q.  And "satisfaction" we know was the code word for "addiction," right?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI: Okay. Let's go back to the video for a second.

MR. BRENNER: Your Honor, Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

(The following discussion was held

sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER:  The line you have drawn, Your Honor, is the witness can't say "ammonia increases addiction."  You just ruled three minutes ago.  It can increase potency, whatever.

What does Mr. Gdanski do?  He brings up a document.  It doesn't say:  Ammonia increases addiction.  It says:  Ammonia increases satisfaction.

Mr. Gdanski, the next question, really quick:  And that's the code word for nicotine? That's the code word for addiction.

Ask your next question.

Dr. Proctor, remind us, what were the main components of the conspiracy, please? A.  Obstruction of the truth �

MR. FURR: Objection, Your Honor. It's cumulative. We've got our diagram. You've heard this over and over.

That's what this is.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I'm comfortable with you making rulings as long as you know the actual facts.  That's not really the way it is .

It's not part of this document.  It's not a subset of those six pages.  It is additional pages from the man's notebook.

So to suggest that it was on their exhibit list is not right.  That's why they sent it to us, 9:00, 10:00, two nights ago.

our exhibit list at all?

MR. BRENNER:  That's what I am told, yeah.  1057 is not � that's what I am told.

MR. GDANSKI:  My understanding is 1057A is on our exhibit list for sure, but it was �

THE COURT:  How long has it been on your exhibit list?

MR. GDANSKI:  My understanding, and I don't want to speak out of turn, is it's been on our exhibit list ever since we've had an exhibit list.  I could be wrong.  I think that that's the case.

It's certainly part of the broader �

THE COURT:  Well that's easy.  Just pull of your exist list and we'll know.

MR. BRENNER:  Again, I'm told it's wrong, but it is what it is.  So if they show it to me, it's on their exhibit list, then it is.

If they show me an exhibit list it's not on, then it isn't.

MR. BRENNER:  Today is Wednesday.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, I sent it Monday night.  He's had it since then.  It is a Philip Morris document.  There's no prejudice.

It's the same exact thing we had from this author saying the same thing that's already in evidence.  There's no prejudice anyway.

I am confident it's on our exhibit list. I don't know that it was on the initial � what we turned over last week.

THE COURT:  Let's see if it was on the exhibit list and then � do you have any other objections besides it wasn't on the exhibit list?

MR. BRENNER: No, it's just a procedural objection, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  That seems, at this moment, to be form over substance considering he has the document in his hands.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, let's just move on.  If he wants to �

THE COURT:  All right.  That will be

admitted into evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1057A was

received in evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So here it says that. Go ahead, read what it says and tell us how you know it says that?

A.  Well, I know a lot about this guy, where the document comes from.  He was deposed about this.  People have worked over this language.

There was some original puzzlement in my mind about the fourth word, but I was able to decipher it given that he's actually confronted with this passage in deposition.  So that's how I've been able to decode it.

Q.  I think I messed up when I read it.  So can you read it to us, please?

A.  It says � this is, again, from a Tamol document, the laboratory notebook, mid 1960s, where he says:  Determine minimum nicotine required to keep normal smokers "hooked."

Please ask the next question. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Not as it relates to marketing, but as it relates to smoker behavior, what was the basis of their business?

A.  They were selling nicotine, an addictive drug.

looked at multiple times?

A.  It is.

Q.  While they're looking, can you define a

term for us?  The term is "sine qua non."

A.  It means the essential ingredient.  It's

Latin for "that without which there is none."

MR. FURR:  That's irrelevant.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. Sustained.  Was there an answer given?

Yes.

The last answer given by the witness is stricken, and it should be disregarded by the jury.

Ask your next question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  RJR, Confidential. Let's try to move through it.

Reynolds stamped it "Confidential" obviously, right? A.  Yes. Q.  Okay.  Go to Page 2, please.

He says:  In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized, and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Well, let me have him finish his question so I can rule on it.  Go ahead. Don't answer it yet. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did Dr. Teague describe in earlier documents the physiological addictive process?

There's no objection. A.  Yes.

Q.  It says on the bottom:  Thus, tobacco product � thus, a tobacco product is, in essence, a vehicle for delivery of what? A.  Nicotine.

Q.  � nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and attractive form.

Did they do that?

You've heard that expression before? A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  What are cigarettes? A.  They are a nicotine delivery device. Q.  Our industry is, then, based upon design, manufacture, and sale of attractive dosage forms of nicotine.

And our company's position in our industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or intangible, to the consumer than those of our competitors. Did they do that? A.  They did. Q.  The term "nicotine delivery device," did

A.  That's basically what they say.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 3, please. Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions, hence no other active material or combination of material provides equivalent � and here you see that term again � "satisfaction," right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Is there anything, Dr. Proctor, in the history of mankind that can deliver nicotine in such a fashion as a cigarette?

A.  No.  They're unusual.

Q.  If nicotine is the sine qua non � that's the term that means without which there's nothing?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco products and tobacco products are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is logical to design our products, and where possible, our advertising, around nicotine delivery rather than, quote, "tar" delivery or flavor, right?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  It says:  This leaves us � after explaining the stages of the smoking process:  This leaves us, then, in the position of attempting to design and promote the same product to two different types of market with two different sets of motivations, needs, and expectations.

So he's talking about the presmoker and the confirmed smoker?

A.  That's right.  It's the two-stage theory.  They have to market to both the presmoker, who is not addicted, and the smoker, who is addicted.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, that's the 14- to 20-year-old market that was the base of their business.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  If we are to attract the nonsmoker or presmoker, there is nothing in this type of product they would currently understand or desire.

Page 4530 That makes sense, right, because they're

not addicted?

A.  Right.

Q.  We have deliberately played down the role of nicotine, hence the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him, and no desire to try it.

Instead, we must somehow convince him with wholly irrational reasons that he should try smoking in the hope that he will, for himself, then discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that what Dr. Teague wrote?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So fool, con, convince children to become drug addicts, right?

A.  Basically.

Q.  Let's take a look at Page 6.

If, as proposed above, nicotine is the sine qua non of smoking, and if we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward reduction or elimination of nicotine � so basically saying if nicotine is the essential ingredient without which there is nothing, no smoking, nothing, if nicotine is that and we move

A.  He says:  We shall eventually liquidate our business, go out of business.

Q.  Dr. Proctor, simply put, without nicotine in cigarettes, would we have a tobacco industry?

A.  No.

Q.  Without nicotine in cigarettes, would we have this epidemic? A.  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  PT2044, we move that into evidence.  It's 2044.

MR. FURR:  Yes, we have an objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do we need to address it now?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, so long as you agree we can address it later without the witness.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I have to hand you the document.  I don't know what to say.  The whole document deals only with one topic, and that's how ammonia effects the way nicotine is perceived by the smoker.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's perfectly fair game.  Now Dr. Proctor can't give his scientific conclusion that ammonia may make it more addictive.

But this is Reynolds.  This is a

MR. FURR:  Then what are we doing asking the witness about this then?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm introducing it right now into evidence because I know once the witness leaves and I try to introduce it, they'll claim that I can't do that anymore.

I don't actually, guite frankly, plan on asking the witness any guestions about it.  I'm trying to introduce it right now.

THE COURT:  So why isn't this an admission by a party opponent?

MR. FURR:  That wasn't the basis of my objection.  The basis of my objection was Dr. Proctor can't testify about this issue about ammonia increasing addictiveness.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't plan on asking a guestion about it.  I plan on moving along with this document and putting it into evidence.  We'd be done with that already.  So I think �

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI: There are going to be a couple of documents that I'm going to try to do that for.

So in order to avoid this process, I'm asking Jeff, Mr. Furr, wait until I ask a question or start to ask a question about a document, because some I'm going to just introduce and move through so we can get this done in the next 10, 12, 15 minutes.

MR. BRENNER:  Before we leave � I'm sorry, before we leave, Your Honor, on the ammonia issue, there's a line.

He's obviously testified about increases potency and things like that, and we're going to cross � I just want to be clear, he's already testified, over my objection, the last time is that it makes it more toxic, makes it more poisonous.

You overruled the objection.  He's testified that it makes it more potent.

I just want to be clear that we're going to cross him on those particular things that he's already said.

has not and should not be able to say, because I

don't think he � actually he won't say, but I

don't think � the actual "it makes it more

addictive."

And I think we're just going to point out on cross that he's � that is not his opinion. But I agree with everything that's been said so far.

I just don't want to stand here silent and think that I'm not � that I'm not planning on crossing him on it, because I am, because he's got a lot in the record already.

MR. GDANSKI:  If they open the door to anything �

MR. BRENNER:  We can deal with it then.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, that's fine.

MR. FURR:  There's nothing more that I want to do than get to my cross-examination, and I want to facilitate this happening as fast as possible, but I did not understand what you're asking me.

MR. GDANSKI:  In other words, there are going to be �

didn't understand what he was saying either.

MR. GDANSKI:  There are going to be several documents,, as you've seen me do.  I'm going to introduce it and not ask a single question about the document.

Usually, if the witness isn't here �

THE COURT:  You need to let him know when you're doing that because he doesn't know. He can't guess.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  So what I'm suggesting is, wait until I ask � Your Honor, we got up here because I introduced a document.

THE COURT:  Well, just tell him.  Just whisper to him:  I'm not going to ask a question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Why doesn't he just wait for a question that he finds objectionable instead of doing what we did just now?

Page 4539 Q.  If it's a good mission, it's a good

thing to do.

I would state our charter from Philip

Morris in this fashion:  Study the psychology of

the smoker in search of information that can

increase corporate profits.

Did they do that to great success?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now in this document, do they examine

the psychology of smoking?

A.  They do.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 3.

There are some distinctive features

about the cigarette market.  We sell a product

that is bought often and used from 10 to 60 times

a day, day in, day out.  We provide a product that

is the essential commodity in a habitual act.

Then it goes on:  You're all familiar

with Pavlov's dog.

Do you remember last week, Dr. Proctor,

we talked about the humanizations, the

anthropomorphization of the tobacco company and

the dehumanization of the smoker?

A.  Yes.

MR.   FURR:      Objection.      Leading.

answer

Page 4540 THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained.

The jury should disregard the last

It's stricken from the record.

Please ask it again.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Did the tobacco companies humanize themselves?

A.  Yes, they did.

Q.  An animalize the smoker?

A.  They did.

Q.  You're all familiar with Pavlov's dog. Present a dog food, he salivates.  Ring a bell each time you present the food, and in due time, you can ring the bell without the food and he will salivate.

That's true, right?

A.  It is.

Q.  You can train a dog to do that, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  Put a hungry rat in a cage.  Put a lever in the cage.  Make it so that a push on the lever delivers a pellet of food.  In its random movements, the rat will push the lever.  He will get the pellet.

The rat will soon associate lever pushing with the food pellet.  In time, he will

Page 4541 rapidly � he will be rapidly pushing the lever

for food.

Then it says:  Consider the smoker.  The

smoker is the lever press.  The effect of that

smoking act upon his person is the reward.  That

effect re-enforces the smoking act.

He comes to push the lever 10 to 60

times per day.  Our task is to understand the

reinforcing mechanism, or process, whereby the

habit is established and maintained.

Such is our model.  Conceptually simple

on the surface, but the complexities lurk in the

numbers beneath the surface.

And did they do that?  Did they study

the smoker?  Did they manipulate it, and did they

create nicotine addicts?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's go to Page 5.

Without the chemical compound �

They're talking about the nicotine?

A.  They are.

Q.  Without the chemical compound, the

cigarette market would collapse, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That's true, isn't it?

Let's go to Page 22. You've seen this chart?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  Okay.  And what's going on here?

A.  Well, this � these are sales of two of the major brands in the United States from the '50s to the '80s, and it shows the rise of Marlboro and eventually overtakes Winston.

This is Winston, which begins in 1954. Marlboro begins as a filter shortly after.  So Marlboro dominates � I'm sorry, Winston dominates, but it's rapidly being overtaken by Marlboro, and then it correlates it with smoke pH down below.

MR. GDANSKI:  374 6, move that into evidence.  Move 3746.

Morris Company, Bob Seligman.

Q.  And did he have memos that he wrote

about comments regarding CTR?

A.  Yes.

So here it's � what's going on in this document?

A.  This is comments about certain � this is an expression of concern about some comments that were being made by a new CTR staff member who had said that:  Opiates and nicotine may be similar in action.

And it goes on to talk about that that is a problem.

Q.  All right.  Go down to the bottom.  It says:  It is my strong feeling with the progress that has been claimed, we are in the process of digging our own grave.  I believe that the program, as set up, has the potential of great damage to the industry.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q. And the process they're referring to is one that, at the top, links opiates and nicotine may be similar in action?

A. Yes, there's concern about the type of science they were funding could, you know, bite them back.

Q.  Okay.  Fair enough.

Let's go to the next one, the follow-up to this document, 1154.

At the bottom dealing with the same subject, CTR meeting and Dr. Osdene, it says: Dr. Seligman brought up the grant by Dr. Abood in which one of the stated aims was to make a clinically acceptable antagonist to nicotine. What does that mean? A.  Yes.  Well, there was concern that one of their grantees was developing a chemical or a therapeutic thing to help you stop smoking, and this was in danger of putting the tobacco industry out of business.

Q.  That's what they say.

This goal would have the potential of putting the tobacco manufacturers out of business. Right?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  � how many millions of pages of documents are there that you could teach over the course of a year on the subject of nicotine in these companies' archives?

A.  Well, there would be millions of

pages

USA

MR. GDANSKI:  2203 from Philip Morris

MR. PHILIPSON:  Do you want me to show it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, please.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Nicotine Program, and it says very simply:  The thing we sell most is Iwhat?

A.  Nicotine.

Q.  Those are their words?

A.  It is.

Q.  So they sold doubt and nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Dr. Teague also wrote something called The Nordine Study?

A.  Yes.

A.  That was one of the studies also done

from the 1970s and '80s.

MR. GDANSKI:  All right.  We move that

into evidence, 1820.

MR. FURR:  No objection.

THE COURT:  This will be admitted into

evidence without objection.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1820 was

received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  So it says here in

1982, regarding the Nordine study to Dr. DiMarco,

it says:  Most of those who have smoked for any

significant time would like to stop.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is that true, Dr. Proctor?

A.  It is true.

Q.  Has the scientific literature and the

public health studies demonstrated that most

smokers do, in fact, want to stop?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Bolstering.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Many, but not most of

those who would like to stop smoking, are able to

do so.

Is that true as well?

A.  It is, yeah.  Most cannot.

Q.  Let's go to Page Number 2.

We should be able to maintain/increase the size of the total market by influencing entry/exit rates.

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's going on there?

A.  Well, entry rates are new people starting to smoke.  Exit rates are people leaving the habit, switching, or dying.

Q.  However, we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could.

That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of business overnight.

A.  Right.

Q.  Did the industry recognize, on multiple occasions with great clarity that, you know, if customers can stop using the drug nicotine with their own free and total will, tobacco companies could be out of business overnight?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, I need a ruling.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll just rephrase it.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase.  It's withdrawn.  Go ahead.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What did the companies understand would happen if smokers were given an absolutely unimpacted, unaffected free choice to stop smoking?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.  And cumulative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open �

He's referring to if customers could stop using if they could?

A.  Yes.  If people had the freedom not to smoke, they could be out of business.

Q.  If/when that occurs � on the bottom.

So if that happens, if customers get the freedom to choose, our options include: 1, go out of business �

And has that always been an option for

A.  Sure.

Q.  � 2, find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking; 3, provide other products, away from conventional cigarettes, which meet the same needs cigarettes now meet, but without the associated negatives.

Do you see that, Dr. Proctor?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's go to Page 3.

We cannot � from Dr. Teague at Reynolds � be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do they still market, sell, manipulate cigarettes?

A.  They do.

Q.  1988, the Surgeon General came out with a report?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And before 1988, had the Surgeon General come out with any report specifically concluding that nicotine was addictive?

MR. FURR:  Objection as to what the 2010 report says.

Page 4555 (The following discussion was held

sidebar:)

THE COURT:  What are you moving it into evidence for?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm moving it into evidence to demonstrate that there is an awareness to the tobacco companies of what the state of affairs is regarding smoking and health and disease and addiction in this country.

Tobacco companies tell smokers to look at the Surgeon General's reports, to rely on Surgeon General's reports regarding information on smoking and health and disease and addiction.

They specifically tell people to go there.

In cases where we have requests for admissions, we ask them to tell us whether or not smoking causes disease, they say:  Look at the Surgeon General, what the Surgeon General has to say.

So they have adopted the �

THE COURT:  So, in essence, it's coming in for the truth of the matter asserted?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  There's two different reasons.  It's not coming in for the truth of the

6c740223-88a3-4024-8c6e-a96830dc3ca6

matter asserted.

THE COURT:  It sounds like it's truth of the matter asserted.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't mean for it to sound like that.  I'm saying it comes in for notice to the companies as to the state of affairs regarding tobacco in this country right now.

THE COURT:  How does � how does � how does � how does the Surgeon General report give tobacco companies notice of the state of the nation?

I mean, that's not the state of the nation.  It's the state of what's said in the

report

of the �

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, no, it's the state

THE COURT:  � which, again, goes to the truth of the matter asserted because it's not a notice thing.

It's not like you were saying, you know, they didn't know way back when that it would � you know, by then, they knew what all the effects were.

They had all kinds of other � there's all kinds of other evidence already in the record

Page 4557 of, you know � about when it is that the tobacco

companies would have already been on notice of it

causing lung cancer and all these types of things.

So it really doesn't go to the notice issue.  So what does it really go to?

MR. GDANSKI:  The notice doesn't end. The notice doesn't stop.  We have claims for punitive damages and reprehensibility.

So notice doesn't stop at some one date. So that's the answer to that question.

Number 2, though is �

THE COURT:  No, because notice is � you know, once you're on notice, you're on notice.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, I don't think that that's � I don't mean to argue with the Court.

I just don't think that that's correct, but I think � what's that?

THE COURT:  I understand your argument.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  Okay.

I think also the fact they link to these on their website and tell people, smokers, public, to go to them, you should rely upon them, demonstrates that they're reliable reports.

They're sufficient and reliable if they

Page 455� tell smokers to go to these reports on their

websites.

That's a separate hearsay exception for an adopted admission.  The companies, when asked for their position on smoking and health, smoking and addiction, advertising, whatever it is, they tell people to go to the Surgeon General's reports.

And they link to each of these.  They link to each of these specifically on their websites.

Ehrhardt recognizes and Florida evidence recognizes the document admission that manifested belief �

THE COURT:  I don't think these reports are adopted admissions in that regard.  I think the fact that they have a website that this refers people to, it doesn't mean that they agree with everything that's on there, unless they specifically say:  We agree and we adopt everything that's in the report.

If they do so, then that's � is that what it says?

MR. FURR:  We say the opposite.  We say the exact opposite.  We say:  The fact that it's

THE COURT:  Well, saying nothing is not an adopted admission.

MR. GDANSKI:  Linking to it and telling people to rely upon it is.

THE COURT:  Well, the Court finds that it's not.

Okay.  So what other basis do you have?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think that these are government reports.  There's a Florida recognized hearsay exception for government reports.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  This falls within that well-recognized exception.

These are reports that must be issued by the Surgeon General's office.  If the Surgeon General failed to issue a report, they would be in violation of their statutory duty.

Page 4560 If the Surgeon General went more than

two years without issuing a report on smoking and

health or something to do with cigarettes, they'd

be in violation of the 1967 Federal Cigarette

Labeling Act.

And so because there's a report � because there's a statute that requires the admission and publication of these reports, they are under a duty to issue these reports.

They are ultimately vetted by the Surgeon General, who is the final author, has final say-so on this process.

If they get a government report, multiple, you know, employees and scientists work and put it together, just like anything else.

But ultimately it's a report from the Surgeon General by duty and mandate of Congress.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, the exception for public records � and this is the Lee case I provided to the Court yesterday.  I have other copies again.

It's matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed by law. It's not anything an agency or an agency official reports under an authority of law. That's everything an agency and agency official

does.

In the Lee case, that was an investigation that was authorized, obviously pursuant to law.

But the witness who was actually on the witness stand was not allowed to testify about her own investigative report that was commissioned by the agency, and that's because it was hearsay, specifically as to both opinions and facts.

And the Court noted that Florida does not recognize.  There's a separate exception in the federal rules for findings of fact by an agency that Florida does not recognize.

It's got to be either the activities of the agency, which this clearly isn't, or matters observed pursuant to a duty of law.  This is not FAA airline data.

THE COURT:  Which case were you referring to?  Is that the Lee case?

MR. EDSON:  Yes, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is matters observed. This is matters observed.  It's mattered observed by the Surgeon General's Office in putting out the report.  That's what exactly this is.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  They also link to that

on their website?

A.  They do.

Q.  Federal Trade Commission reports, those reports are done and reported to Congress?

A.  They are.

Q.  All right.  There is two of them that you're familiar with, PT � there's one from which year, '67 and?

A.  And '81.

Q.  '81.  All right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Those reports are PT3870 and 5480.  We move those both into evidence.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, the 1967 report has already been excluded.  And we'd move to exclude the other report based on the same objection.

THE COURT:  Which report was that?

MR. FURR:  The 1967 report has already been excluded by the Court.  Yesterday it was.

THE COURT:  Can the parties approach on that one?  I don't recall that.

THE COURT:  What was the name?  Was it during the conspiracy?

MR. GDANSKI:  It is during the conspiracy, yes.

MR. EDSON:  It's during the conspiracy, but the FTC is not a co-conspirator.

THE COURT:  This is the FTC?

MR. EDSON:  Yes, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It is more than 20 years old.  It is done specifically as a duty to Congress, and it does report on what's appropriate under the law.

MR. EDSON:  I think Your Honor ruled that statements of opinion were inadmissible. There is virtually no evidence that it has any significant effect, end quote.  That's an opinion of the Federal Trade Commission.

this is on the one � just to refresh your

recollection, it came out in deposition

Plaintiff had argued it was an ancient document.  This is from 1967.  Your Honor ruled statements of fact �

THE COURT:  All the ones we've been doing now are from � Mr. Gdanski, all the ones we've been doing now are from 2010 on?

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  The last few were 2010, '12, and '14.

THE COURT:  This is post the discovery of the conspiracy and all that.  So this is different.  This is back in 1967 at the heart of the conspiracy.

MR. BRENNER: I'm just trying to refresh your recollection what happened. Plaintiff argued the ancient document rule that they come in. This is the '67 FTC and also applied to �

THE COURT:  Is it for the truth of the matter asserted?

MR. GDANSKI:  No, it's coming in for multiple reasons.  Number one, this was during the course of the conspiracy when the tobacco

warnings are not necessary, but they're saying

people have been sufficiently warned.

It gives them the notice.  It gives the tobacco companies notice during the period of time they're conspiring and lying that what they're doing is working.

In other words, the warnings are having no impact because the notice that � smokers are continuing to smoke despite the warnings.

MR. EDSON:  It gives them � I mean I can go through the specifics of it.  Because the reason they're offering it is not for notice. They want � know that the Federal Trade Commission agrees with Dr. Proctor's opinions that the warnings were inadequate.

That's what the jury will get from that. This is classic bolstering.  They have put in internal company documents about what we knew and when we knew it.

That's how they proved what was noticed to us.  The only reason they want this in � and the overwhelming effect of putting this into evidence is that a federal agency, who we are not here to cross-examine, will tell the jury that

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not true.

THE COURT:  You know, these things that are happening from 2010 on, these last arguments that you've had, I don't see how it could possibly be used for anything other than the truth of the matter asserted because I don't see how notice is still in effect in 2010 when this � you know, the plaintiff wasn't smoking by then.

The conspiracy has been well known by then.  It's all been public by then.  So � but this is in 1967.  So, you know, I'm having difficulty with this one.  I'm not understanding �

MR. EDSON:  Here's the issue, Your Honor:  What they're saying, and I think what Your Honor is saying, is there might be some marginal relevance to notice.

The problem is that if Your Honor introduces this into evidence, the risk is that the jury will use it for the truth of the matter asserted.

Because it's a statement by the Federal Trade Commission that endorses the opinions of

Page 4572 based on what has been presented, you know, I was

either deferring on it or I hadn't ruled on it.

I don't recall ruling on it.  If I did, I could revisit my ruling.

MR. BRENNER:  Of course.  All I'm going to say is � I'll just tell you what you ruled.

It is sort of � what you said � you sent the parties back to confer on it, and you said if it's a statement of fact, you're going to let it in, and:  If it's a statement of opinion, I'm not going to let it in.

That's what you ruled, and the procedure I'm sort of objecting to is it's a huge issue in the case.

THE COURT:  Right.  That applies if � that's true.  That applies if it's hearsay, but I think what they're saying is it's coming in only for notice purposes, so it's coming in only for notice, then that requirement is � that requirement came out of Ehrhardt, and you gave it to me .

And it says you have to have an independent basis for the hearsay exception on that type of document.

And so that was my ruling based on that,

Page 4573 but that assumes it's coming in for the truth of

the matter asserted.  I believe it's coming in

only for notice purposes.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's exactly right.  We just argued this a second ago.

MR. EDSON:  Just so the Court understands our position � I understand the Court's position.  Number one, our position is that the hearsay purpose of this, under a 403 analysis, which kind of takes into account the hearsay versus the non-hearsay �

MR. GDANSKI:  The defense doesn't get to dictate how I can put in evidence.  I can put in evidence.  I have a legal, good-faith, totally unobjectionable basis to introduce a document into evidence.

THE COURT:  Couldn't you put in these documents for notice purposes, and that's what the jury is going to use it for?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't �

MR. EDSON:  Let me confer with my co-counsel on whether we would ask for an instruction.

If it's coming in for notice, he can't use it for any purpose.  He cannot use it for �

with it is by an instruction.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think we all understand Your Honor's ruling with a potential future instruction maybe.  So what are we doing right now?

MR. EDSON:  I would like a second because we're entitled � if it's coming in for a limited purpose, we are entitled to a contemporaneous instruction.

So if I could have a second to confer with my co-counsel?

THE COURT:  Sure.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  You have to tell the jury what is �

THE COURT:  Notice as to �

MR. GDANSKI:  Notice as to effect of their conspiracy.  I'm happy to put that in, but I'm sure no one will want that.

In other words, while they're conspiring, the Federal Trade Commission is observing that the conspiracy is working.

The cigarette sales are rebounding. Warnings and caution labels aren't having the intended effect, and it's because of the fact that they were able to get the upper hand on the message and manipulate the information about smoking and health.

MR. BRENNER:  When you see it, you'll understand it's being offered for the truth of the matter.

MR. GDANSKI:  This document came out in 1967 while tobacco companies were committing a fraud and conspiracy.

This was a publicly available document, so the company surely had access to it, reviewed it, understood it, and read it.

And it demonstrates that, despite the fact that � despite the fact that caution labels

positions, the tobacco companies, what we now know

to be their fraud and conspiracy, statements made

in furtherance of their fraud and conspiracy, were

working because smoking rates were rebounding.

The caution statement did not have the intended effect that it was supposed to have.  And the tobacco companies were, therefore, on notice at the time that their conspiracy, their conduct, their actions, their statements were working.

Their advertisements were working.  The document talks about that as well, I believe.  I don't have it committed to memory.

It talks about the impact and effect of advertising and the saturation of advertising and how that affected smoking behavior.

So this tells the tobacco companies, this gives them the notice of what they're doing is working.  The conduct, the course of action they've taken is working.

It's a Federal Trade Commission report. It does �

THE COURT:  But their conduct � how do they � they're put on notice that their own conduct is working?

Page 4582 MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Of course.

They're going to be put on notice based on the

data and what comes out publicly that smoking

behaviors and their fraud, the statements they

make in furtherance of their fraud are, in fact �

THE COURT:  How's that a notice �

behaviors

MR. GDANSKI:  � affecting smoking

THE COURT:  How's that a notice issue?

How do they even need to be on notice?  I mean that � they had made a determination that they were going to do what they were going to do, whether or not it was � you know, whether or not it was working or not working.

I mean how successful their � so they're on notice of how successful their conspiracy was; is that what you're trying to tell me?

That's your only notice argument?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Can I chime in a little bit, Your Honor, if you don't mind?

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I met you beforehand at the pretrial hearings.

THE COURT:  Sure.

Humphries.

THE COURT:  I remember you.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Oh, thank you, and I'll be handling the appeal obviously, the appellate issues.

I did want to give you a little backdrop.  These are documents that have come in virtually every, if not all, of the trials that have gone.

THE COURT:  But for what purpose?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Generally they come in for two purposes.  The one that you're talking about right now regarding notices, remember that one of the big issues that this jury has to decide is the question of reprehensibility.

(Witness enters the courtroom and re-takes stand.)

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Did the defendants knowingly, willfully, and everything else delineated in the punitive damages statute, engage in conduct despite knowing its consequences and its severe consequences?

So, yes, we do have a burden here, a very high burden for punitive damages.  We don't

Page 4584 have just the greater weight of the evidence.  We

have clear and convincing evidence.  That's our

standard on punitives.

And we have to do � put forth every bit of evidence that we can to the jury to let them understand that the defendants were intentionally acting this way, number one, and, number two, continued to do so knowing the consequences of what they were doing.

So it is directly relevant to that, and I'll say �

THE COURT:  Okay.  I understand that a little better now.

Okay.  Go ahead.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, I think actually they've made my case for me that this is being offered for its truth.

Dr. Proctor has been testifying for now five days about what we knew from our internal files.

This doesn't add anything to that.  What this does is bolster his opinion about the effectiveness of the '66 warnings.

Their whole theory is that we knew we were successful and, therefore, continued doing

Page 4585 it.  That's what they've been putting on evidence

from internal documents.

The only thing this could possibly add to what's not already in evidence, and they're going to argue from what's already in evidence, is to put the imprimatur of the United States Government on their witness's testimony.  That's the purpose of this coming into evidence.

And just to correct what's been said, this doesn't come in in every case; and, in fact, I know Your Honor has been following Judge Murphy. I believe Judge Murphy sustained an objection to a question about that document in his most recent trial, Robertson.

So I don't agree with the submission that it comes with every case.  And that is a � where it comes in seems to be a shrinking universe.

But obviously we're in front of Your Honor today and Your Honor has to make this determination.

I think they made very clear that what they want to do is use the federal government to bolster their witness.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to

therein.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you, sir. (Plaintiff's Exhibit Nos. PT3870 and 5480 were received in evidence.)

THE COURT:  All right.  So now let's go to the evidentiary hearing on the in camera inspection and the privilege issues and waiver defenses � or waiver claims as to the privileged documents.

Do the defendants have a witness that they'd like to put on?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I just � on one particular document, I have two questions to ask Dr. Proctor, but I think the plaintiff agrees with them.

As to Document 5837, if I can just get � if the plaintiff agrees, then I won't have to do it.

5837 is this document.

probably the case.  I don't know enough about it

specifically.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Do you agree that the

document 5837 is from the law firm Arnold &

Porter?

A.  I believe it is, yes.

Q.  Okay.  And it's written to Philip Morris

counsel?

A.  Yes.

argue from the document, Your Honor.  I just want

that clear, that it's �

reading it

Morris used to take actions and make decisions in

furtherance of an ongoing fraud?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Was it the outside counsel � you mentioned what's on the screen to left.

Was the outside counsel in that case � in this case, it's Arnold & Porter.

Was the outside counsel and some of the outside law firms, including the one that's addressed and discussed at issue in this document, used, and as it relates to this document, specifically used and utilized to perpetrate and effectuate an ongoing fraud? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Does the document itself discuss the perpetuation of that fraud? A.  Yes. Q.  Okay.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I think it's appropriate for Your Honor to read it.  I don't agree with anything � Dr. Proctor's opinion about what this document is.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, it is �

him a guestion, but I mean I think of all the

documents that demonstrate the fraud, this one is

pretty high up there.

Who has the document, anybody?

MR. PHILIPSON:  Do you want me to put it

on the screen?

MR. GDANSKI:  Here it is.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Was the fraud of the

tobacco companies the misleading of the public?

A.  That was a principle component, yes.

Q.  Was the fraud of the public to confuse

them with the dual position that the public is not

being fully informed and the case is still open?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So let's just look at this

document for a second.

Does this specific document in this

specific paragraph reference both of those exact

two aspects?

A.  Correct.

Q.  All right.  That was � this document is dated February 4th, 1976, correct?

A.  It is.

Q.  But the information about what happened to tar ratings was common knowledge in the 1950s, wasn't it?

MR. GDANSKI:  What's this got to do with whether or not the lawyers perpetuated a fraud, whether tar ratings were common knowledge?

The filtered cigarette smoker is, in

most cases, getting as much or more nicotine and

tar from the filter than he would get from the

regular cigarette the advertisers have persuaded

him to abandon for its health sake.

Q.  Okay.  And that's just paraphrasing the Blatnick hearings, correct?

Q.  Okay.  And this information was published in The New York Times in 1958?

MR. GDANSKI:  And just so the record is clear, "Compelled Production" was not written at the time it was drafted, right, Counsel?

MS. LEHMAN:  Correct.  This was � this was written when RJ Reynolds was forced, over their objections, to produce this document.

MR. GDANSKI:  Do you have a version that doesn't say that?

THE WITNESS:  It's got the � my version has the "Compelled Production" on it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  Mine doesn't have that.

Q.  (BY MS. LEHMAN)  All right.  So looking at this, if you'll follow along with me:  The new filter brands vying for a piece of the growing filter market made extraordinary claims.

There was an urgent effort to highlight and differentiate one brand from the others already on the market.

It was important to have the most filter traps.  Some claimed to possess the least tars.

In most cases, however, the smoker of

nicotine or tar as he would have gotten from a

regular cigarette.

This is � what we have just � did I

read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

It goes on to say:  He had abandoned the regular cigarette, however, on the ground of reduced risk to health.

Q.  And this is parroting the same information that we just read in The New York Times in the 1958 article, isn't it?

A.  Not really, no.  I mean it's related, but it's not what I would call the same.

Q.  It's related.

And you don't have any evidence, do you, that what we've just read in this document called "Industry Response to Cigarette Health Controversy" that that's based on unique research that Brown & Williamson was doing in the '70s, do you?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I'm going to object.  It has nothing to do with the inquiry of crime-fraud.

anything unique to Brown & Williamson.

Q.  (BY MS. LEHMAN)  And it's based on the same kind of general understanding that was in the public domain in that New York Times article in the 1950s, isn't it?

A.  That's completely false.  I mean the manufacturer knew much more about how precisely these were engineered to be fraudulent than Blatnick did, because the Blatnick hearings were just worried about exaggerated claims for filters.

There's a much more sophisticated knowledge inside the industry.  The Blatnick didn't even have access to the industry archives. And not only that, the industry refused to attend the Blatnick hearings.  They were completely absent.  Every company refused to even testify.

Q.  Dr. Proctor, the article that we just looked at in the 1950s relates to filters, doesn't it?  That was information that was publicly �

A.  Yes.

litigation?

A.  Yes.

Q.  For example, you know that Judge Kessler from the District Court in Washington, D.C., has found that the tobacco companies, through their lawyers, specifically naming Shook, Hardy & Bacon and other law firms, actively assisted the defendants in perpetuating their conduct, right?

MS. LEHMAN:  Object.  Objection, Your Honor.  This is � this is beyond the scope of this � this expert should not � I'm sorry, this witness should not be giving testimony about what Judge Kessler has found.  Beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just a proffer.  It's to establish the record as far as what's taking place.

THE COURT:  Well, I'll � I'll sustain the objection, however, that will be useful for you as a proffer, what you've just done.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  Sure. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Is there any doubt, Dr. Proctor, I mean �

But how many objections did you make to the other lawyers' guestions?

MR. GDANSKI:  But Your Honor �

THE COURT:  You didn't take the same position there.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor overruled all them.

THE COURT:  Well, I know I did, but in other circumstances, I might not have.  But why make the objection if that was your position?

All right.  Go ahead. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, just, you know, sort of talking about the concept of truth and reality and history and what actually took place, you know, in real world, in realtime, is there any doubt historically, factually, that the lawyers, based on the documents, including the in-house counsel, the general counsel, Addison Yeaman, and other folks who were in-house counsel, and the out-house lawyers �

THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me just correct something.  This is not a proffer.  This is an evidentiary hearing.

camera inspection.

So you're absolutely wrong about that. This is not a proffer.  We are conducting an evidentiary hearing as to whether or not the Court is going to admit these evidence � these documents or not.  Okay?

So just � I want to make sure the record is clear on that.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We're no longer on a

proffer

Go ahead.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, as a matter of evidence and testimony, what does the historical record clearly, factually demonstrate as to the role lawyers, in-house counsel, and contracted, private counsel from law firms played in perpetrating a fraud?

A.  Well, I've already testified about that. I know that the Committee of Counsel was the prime authority.

There was also something called the Ad Hoc Counsel comprised of external lawyers; and both of these were key instruments, organizers of

Q.  And as a matter of evidence for the

record, I would introduce each of these documents

for purposes of this evidentiary hearing into the

record.

I'd also introduce Judge Kessler's opinion from the District Court of Columbia as a matter of record.

THE COURT:  You could ask me to take judicial notice, I suppose, of that perhaps; but I'm not sure that gets introduced through this witness.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not asking � I'm done with my guestions of Dr. Proctor.

I am asking the Court to take judicial notice of Judge Kessler's opinion from the District Court of Columbia which finds that tobacco companies did � I'm not guoting verbatim of course.  I can pull it out.

� did assist and help on multiple levels perpetuate a fraud, and Judge Kessler comments:  What a sad and disguieting chapter the role that the law firms played in this somewhat � in this noble profession.

And that's almost a direct guote:  What

played in this noble profession of being lawyers.

So I would ask the Court take judicial notice of her opinion.

I would ask the Court obviously to take judicial notice of the binding opinion from the Fourth District Court of Appeals in Florida on this issue of whether or not the tobacco companies have perpetuated a fraud.

I'd ask �

THE COURT:  I don't need to take judicial notice of cases, of legal authorities �

MR. GDANSKI:  Fair enough.

THE COURT:  � normal legal authorities. That's different than Judge Kessler's opinion.

MR. GDANSKI:  You're right.  That's true.

And I just think the uncontroverted evidence � I mean if Your Honor reads �

THE COURT:  So what is it that you're moving into evidence so that I can find out if there's any objections?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm moving into evidence the actual documents that Your Honor has for review to introduce in this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, but I'm introducing �

THE COURT:  So how can they be introduced in evidence when I haven't finished an in camera inspection of those?

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, this is an evidentiary hearing now.  We're outside of the bounds of this trial for a moment.

Let's assume we're having this evidentiary hearing two weeks ago, if we hadn't started trial, which is essentially what we're doing for a second, I'm seeking, for purposes of the record of this evidentiary hearing, to introduce those documents into evidence for this evidentiary hearing.

That's what I'm asking to do.  That's � that's not saying �

THE COURT:  Well, that's somewhat unusual because normally you wouldn't know � you wouldn't necessarily know what the documents are.

privilege log.

and the Court � well, I

think there has been, hasn't there?

MR. HAMMER:  No, there hasn't our whole issue.

That's

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, I'm just saying �

THE COURT:  I thought I saw a privilege log, that you guys had these on a privilege log.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, sir.  There's not been.  After we filed our exhibit list in this case, they never filed a privilege log.  No, sir, none at all.

So right now you ask what evidence we're putting into the record, not our legal argument, but what evidence.

So the evidence is the testimony from Dr. Proctor; and I think in this unique circumstance, the documents that we want to put into the trial as evidence actually prove the commission of the crime-fraud.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I don't think I

I've ruled on the in camera inspection.

The whole purpose of the in camera inspection is for the Court to review them and make a decision on them.

What's the defendants' position on it?

MR. BRENNER:  Well, Your Honor, I was just going to finish my question.  You told me I would have a chance.  Before Mr. Gdanski launches into his legal argument �

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. BRENNER:  � I just want to finish a few questions.

THE COURT: Well, let me find out about his � your position on his documents he wants to admit.

MR. BRENNER:  The documents, I think you're right, they don't go into evidence.  I think all Mr. Gdanski wants to do is have marked the documents that you're actually going to do an in camera inspection of, so the record reflects, which we've done � if we haven't, we can just read the numbers so the record will reflect what documents Your Honor is doing an in camera inspection on.

MR. BRENNER:  That, I think is �

THE COURT:  Who can read those numbers

for us?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think my point is, the irony of this is that the documents that are at issue are the same documents that prove and are dispositive of the issue.

So usually we don't know what's in the documents.  Here we know that those documents will prove the inquiry correct in our favor and demonstrate that the lawyers played a role in the fraud.

That's why we have a good-faith basis, and courts have consistently ruled in this favor. So I'm asking Your Honor to take those documents into consideration when evaluating the question.

THE COURT:  Obviously I'm going to take them into consideration.  I'm doing an in camera inspection of them.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  I understand, but it's not the same.  But, in any event, I understand, Your Honor.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Doing lots of different things, right?

Q.  You're not suggesting to this Court that by virtue of being a lawyer for a tobacco company, you were involved in the, quote, unquote, fraud, are you?

A.  No.

Q.  Right.  So what � the fact � when you were giving answers that the lawyers were involved in the fraud, you're not saying, you know, sort of as the lawyers would say, res ipsa, everything a lawyer writes is part of the fraud, right?

A.  No.

Q.  Right.

So � and I think it is your position, some things lawyers did, and some things � some things particular lawyers did, and some particular lawyers were involved, and that has to be done on a person-by-person, a document-by-document basis, correct?

A.  Yes, or company-by-company basis.

Q.  Well, not all � not even by company by company.  Not all lawyers for any company were involved in a fraud, correct?

documents.

And you've been focusing this evidentiary hearing on the crime-fraud objection. There are a couple �

THE COURT:  I have been?  I mean you guys have been, I suppose.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Well, yeah, I am saying "you."  I'm sorry.

Right now what we, the parties, have been doing have been focusing on one of our arguments.

THE COURT:  Right.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  We have different arguments as to why �

THE COURT:  How long would that take, because the Court does need to take a recess as

well?

about?

How long � how long are we talking

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I can make my points in less than ten minutes.

THE COURT:  No, five minutes a side. All right?  And I'm timing you guys.

All right?  Five minutes.  Let's go.

Page 4631 MS. HUMPHRIES:  My husband says I talk

fast, so here I go.

The first point that we would make is, in fact, a privilege log was required.  For them to � all of this is about privilege and them maintaining a privilege.

To do that, they were required to file, in this particular case, a privilege log.  A document they put on a website doesn't count.  I would cite a case of mine at the Fifth DCA back in 2004.  That's the Bankers case.

THE COURT:  Well, they did file a motion in limine.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  That is not a privilege log, and that does not count for purposes of that. We can delve into that if you'd like.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  There's also a Fourth �

THE COURT:  But either way, I'm conducting an in camera anyway, whether or not there's a privilege log or not.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  But the lack of a privilege log, that eliminates the need for all of this evidentiary discussion.

log and you don't specifically identify the

documents, because we identified the documents in

our exhibit list.

They were, then, obligated to specifically delineate what their problem was. And when you don't do that, it's an instant waiver.  There is no need for everything �

THE COURT:  So you're saying the Court is going above and beyond the call of duty on it?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I think what you're doing is addressing all of our arguments that we're making, and one of them is the crime-fraud exception.

And I'm saying you don't have to entertain that argument of ours.  You can stop right at the lack of a privilege log, number one.

Number two, I do want to give you a little more support for the crime-fraud exception. This is very important.  The Fourth DCA, American Tobacco versus State, exactly the evidence you've heard.

And, Your Honor, for purposes of the evidentiary hearing, it's the evidence you heard here, but you can also, sir, continue

And now you've heard, and I'm quoting from the Fourth DCA's decision: And that their counsel were involved in carrying out the fraud.

That was the basis that the Fourth DCA relied upon to say that the privilege did not apply, and we're talking attorney/client privilege, did not apply because the attorneys themselves participated.

And when we're asking you to look at the Kessler decision, that is a �

And the quote is:  Finally, a word must be said about the role of the lawyers in this 50-year history of deceiving smokers, potential smokers, and the American public about the hazards of smoking and secondhand smoke, and the addictiveness of nicotine.

They devised and coordinated both national and international strategy.  They directed scientists as to what research they should and should not undertake.  They vetted scientific research papers and report as well as public relations materials to ensure that the interest of the enterprise would be protected.

They identified friendly scientific witnesses, subsidized them with grants from the Center for the Tobacco Research and the Center for Indoor Air Research, paid them enormous fees, and often hid the relationship between those witnesses and the industries.  And they devised and carried out document destruction policies and took shelter behind baseless assertions of attorney/client privilege.

The last line is what Mr. Gdanski referenced:  What a sad and disguieting chapter in the history of an honorable and often courageous profession.

And that sends us back to the Fourth DCA's decision.  The Fourth DCA not only citing

Page 4635 United States Supreme Court law looked

particularly at Florida Supreme Court privilege

and talked about attorney/client privilege in the

context of corporations.

And specifically quoted the Florida Supreme Court's 1994 decision to say:  Thus, to minimize the threat of corporations' cloaking information with the attorney/client privilege in order to avoid discovery, claims of privilege in the corporate context will be subject to a heightened level of scrutiny.

And that's why our court here, the Fourth, allowed these documents in that litigation, and, Your Honor, that was back in 1997.

So that is one of our arguments, one of our bases for the admissibility of this despite their attorney/client claim.  It doesn't work for fraud.

It also doesn't work when you don't specifically identify the documents you claim are privileged in this case.

Also they have not explained to you how they � how they didn't waive the privilege back in the congressional hearings.

Page 4636 They turned these documents over in

response to the subpoena.  They did not formally

object back then.  What they did instead is after

the fact, they went to the congressional committee

and said:  Oh, by the way, can you keep this to

yourself?  Can you keep it confidential?

And our final point is, how can they claim that attorney/client privilege exists when these documents have been out over 15 years.  You right now can go find them on the Internet.  How are they privileged?

And the only other point I would make, and it's not a legal argument, is to say these documents have been admitted in numerous trials. Those trials that result in plaintiff's verdicts, this issue has before been appealed and has never resulted in a reversal.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Excellent.  Five minutes and ten seconds.  Very, very precise.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  My husband would not be surprised that I was fast.

there was no document request for these documents,

no privilege log is required.

Secondly, in terms of no evidence of waiver, counsel specifically addressed the subpoenas from the House committee.  And I will point you to the notebook that I provided you earlier.  The subpoenas are at Tab 6.

At Tab 7, I have our immediate response, that is, before we produced any documents, we asserted the privilege.

The letter at Tab 8 is the response from Chairman Bliley.  And he says, I quote:  The claim for privilege requested in these subpoenas will not be recognized.

And then he threatened them with contempt if they did not comply.

I point you to Tab Number 9.  Those are the letters that attached our response.  In every letter, there is a statement about privilege. That is the cover letter for the production.

I point you to Tab 10.  Those are more letters.  When we follow up again almost immediately, reminding them of the importance of our privilege and the importance in the legal

Now it is clear that Congress does not recognize claims of privilege in attorney/client � attorney/client privilege.

I have provided you a transcript at Tab 11 of an analogous criminal hearing in the Whitewater hearings where there is a discussion about how when there is a subpoena, it is not a voluntary waiver when the production of the documents is compelled.

That was not a voluntary waiver.

At Tab 12, I have attached an affidavit from a former chief counsel and staff director of a subcommittee on the House Committee of Commerce.

That is the same committee, not the same subcommittee, but the same committee that issued the subpoenas to the tobacco companies.

And in that affidavit, he states that in 21 years, they never once recognized a claim of privilege.

In short, Your Honor, the production in response to the congressional subpoenas was compelled.  It was not voluntary.

At every step of the way, we have tried to preserve this privilege.

MS. LEHMAN:  It's one document, yes, Your Honor.

This is the document that � the Brown & Williamson versus Carter case, that's the First DCA case I pointed out earlier.  It's in your notebook.

And in that case, Your Honor, the court said:  The trial court admitted the document on the theory that it fit within the crime or fraud exception to the privilege.

And this is what the First DCA says.

That is how significant it is.  They're thinking about reversing on that one issue alone.

It could not be in furtherance of a conspiracy because it is looking back and summarizing what has happened before.

And think about what Dr. Proctor said. He said that this document talks about the same general kinds of information that was in The New York Times two decades before.

That can't be a conspiracy.  That can't be a fraud.  It can't be a crime.  It's already in the public domain.

MR. EDSON:  � Parklane Hosiery Company versus Shore, 439 U.S. 322, they can't rely on the collateral estoppel effect of a judgment if there's inconsistent other judgments.

And I would provide to the Court an order from Judge Sanchez- � well, we've got the Carter case.  We've also got � I have an order from one trial.

And there are others, but the Hardin case that was tried in Miami-Dade in front of Judge Sanchez-Llorens, Paragraph 28, the Bliley order was granted as to the only Bliley document they argued in that case, and that was from June of this year.

So they can't just pick and choose the judgments they want.  It comes back to a document-by-document review, which is all those other cases say.

And I think the evidence in this case �

(Defendants' Exhibit No. 2 was received

in evidence for purposes of the evidentiary hearing only.)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I just don't want to get lost in the shuffle on this.

On 5837, I have numerous substantive objections, some of which you've already sustained on other documents.

I don't want �

THE COURT:  5837?

MR. BRENNER:  Yes.  I don't want it to get lost in the privilege issue.

There's lots wrong with this document, but at its core, the document is talking about, well, what's going to happen in individual lawsuits and what's going to happen on a legislative front.

I just don't want you to think that I don't have substantive objections to this document.

THE COURT:  So it goes into legislation. That's different.

MR. BRENNER:  And it's all about �

THE COURT:  Well, that doesn't goes to the privilege issue.

MR. BRENNER:  No, it's not the privilege issue.

It's also all about defending individual suits, what's going to happen in individual suits.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll redact the legislation.

MR. BRENNER:  It has nothing � nothing to do with this.  So I think that the document is just replete with objectionable material, including the paragraph that they had � Dr. Proctor read half of.

The whole paragraph is about �

THE COURT:  Does the discussion of any suits go to the privilege issue?

MR. BRENNER:  It does not go to the privilege issue.  I just want to make sure you have my substantive objections.

When you read it, I think you'll see, on 5837.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Defense of suits has been permitted by Your Honor, but legislation has not,

	So you would stipulate to

take
	out legis
	>lation
	if it comes in?


	MR.
	HAMMER:
	On that document, yes.

	defend lawsuits has been

	Just for the record, this is

a privilege hearing.

ob jec

were

MR. HAMMER:  I just want to say it for the record, Judge.

THE COURT:  You guys have made that point several times.

MR. HAMMER:  American Tobacco Company versus State of Florida, which is cited at 697 So.2d �

THE COURT:  The Fourth DCA case, you're talking about?

MR. HAMMER:  Exactly.

And � but most importantly, Judge, these defendants were all parties to that case. They knew about it, and they didn't provide it to you, and that's improper.

It's just improper to be citing law and providing the Court law and not providing the Court with a case that goes contrary to their position.

THE COURT:  All right.  Anything further from anybody?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I've almost got pertinent parts of the Kessler decision printed out.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's 1600 pages long.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  And I'm giving you the first two pages that has the guote on it.

MR. GDANSKI: And we did file in another case � I didn't have time to put together in this case �

THE COURT:  I'm not taking judicial notice of a 1600-page document.

MR. GDANSKI: Right. I'm not asking you to.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I will not do that.

MR. GDANSKI:  But I did file in another case for the defendants.  I can hand you a copy. I don't have time to transfer it to the style of this case, just for purposes of another case.

It's called Caprio, C-A-P-R-I-O.  We filed a brief with excerpts of the portions of Judge Kessler's opinion, which is � it's the same excerpts.  It's just this document was filed in �

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll just take this for persuasive purposes.  It's not coming in for judicial notice or anything else.

the following proceedings continued from Volume 33 at 1:20

THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court is back in session.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

All right.  Ready to proceed?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

MR. EDSON:  We did agree on a limiting instruction.  May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

All right.  Thank you.

So I don't say it's not being admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.  I say this. This is what everybody wants?

MR. BRENNER:  When the FTC report is introduced.

MR. EDSON:  It's captured in that sentence.

THE COURT:  All right.  No problem.  Bring them in.

MR. GDANSKI:  And what � what �

THE COURT:  You can't possibly have expected me to have completed an in-camera inspection in 15 minutes, could you have?

recess to finish

only
	cou.
	Ld get through so much of that.
	

	MR.
	GDANSKI
	:  Fair enough.  So what I would

prop
	ose doing is,
		I will say, no further

ques
	tions pending the Court's pending inquiry.
		

	THE
	COURT:
	Sure.


	MR.
	GDANSKI

can

out
	for a second

on this.
		
	


	MR.
	GDANSKI

Whil

Page 4661 MR. BRENNER:  Yes.  And I think he also

would want to weigh in on the procedure

Mr. Gdanski just suggested.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  I am also going to ask to play a video from 1988, when the Surgeon General's report came out.  It is a publicly available video to the public.  It goes to notice.  It goes to awareness.  It's PT 4725 and 1777A.  We played them both in opening statements -- or one of them in opening statements without objection.  So I want to play that.  I don't want to start, ask to play it, and then have a sidebar --

THE COURT:  All right.  Is there any objection to that, those being played?

MR. GUEST:  We do have objections to those, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  What are the objections?

MR. GUEST:  The objections would be �

THE COURT:  They say they go to notice.

MR. GUEST:  The objection would be that they go to hearsay and it's Koop's statements, he's the SGR.  I don't think there's notice of anything relevant to the claims in this lawsuit.

Number 2, I think a lot of the statements

Page 4662 Dr. Koop makes in the video should be excluded

under 403 as prejudicial �

THE COURT:  Is this C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general at the time?

MR. GUEST:  Yes, it is, Your Honor.  For instance, he takes on the industry's position that choice cannot be an element of anything relating to smoking behavior, and the jury is obviously going to hear information along those lines.  And I think it's prejudicial to have Dr. Koop making those statements in a video when that's an element in the case, and it certainly doesn't go to notice on any issue relating to �

MR. GDANSKI:  Those are not legal �

THE COURT:  How does it go to notice?

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to notice because this is during the period of time when the conspiracy is happening, there's evidence that Mr. Shulman is still smoking.  There's confusion out there.  The tobacco companies are maintaining that smoking is not addictive.  The public health community is maintaining it is. This is the evidence --

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to � these are being admitted as a demonstrative or

MR. GDANSKI:  In evidence.

THE COURT:  I'm going to admit them in evidence for notice purposes only.  I'll give the same instruction.

What else have we got?  The other issue is that, of course � I mean, I've had -- during the break I had a maybe -- the break was longer than we had anticipated, so in the last 35 minutes or so that I've had, 35, 40 minutes, I haven't been able to get through my in-camera inspection yet.  I've only done part of it.  So I have to continue that.

So the question is going to be, when he gets done and he turns it over to you, do we have you guys start, or do we take a break at that point in time for me to finish my review of the inspection?  Or do we start it and then reopen it for them?  And I'm not sure what the defense prefers.  Plaintiff has already told me how they would like to do it.

MR. FURR:  As much as I've been waiting for four-and-a-half days to get started, after four-and-a-half days I don't really want to start my cross-examination and then at some

in-camera inspection.

All right.  Bring them in.

I'm being told that I didn't play it for the jury.

We talked about Edward Horrigan on the Ted Koppel

Show?

A    Yes.

Q    I don't know that we played it.  We moved

it into evidence.  It's 1751AA.

A    I think we did play it.

Q    We did play it?  I'm going to take the word

MR. GDANSKI:  Thanks, Rob. Back to where we left off.  I appreciate that, Dr. Proctor.  Thank you.

So we moved into evidence the FTC report from 1967, PT 3870.  We moved that into evidence. THE COURT:  Is that the FTC report? MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  This is being admitted over objection for notice.  You may not -- the jury may not consider it as evidence of the matters asserted in it.

You may proceed. (Exhibit PT 3870 was admitted into evidence.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  That will be in evidence.

THE COURT:  For notice. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, for the jury's benefit, can you explain, please, what the FTC reports are.

A    The FTC is a federal agency that governs fair trade, and they also were the ones involved in looking at certain claims being made by cigarettes, and also reported more generally about what the

MR. FURR:  There is one additional objection that did not apply to 6701 that we have to put on the record, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  Do you want to approach on that one?

MR. FURR:  Yes.  Thank you very much. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, the additional objection is, this is a report �

THE COURT:  Wait until everybody has gotten here and speak up a little bit.  Because when the white noise is on, it's hard for me to hear you.

MR. EDSON:  Certainly, Your Honor.

The additional objection is that this report from the Federal Trade Commission recommends that the warnings that were in effect in 1981 need to be strengthened to adequately warn the public.

This goes to the preemption issue because now it's attacking the adequacy of the 1969 warning.  And notice that the warnings after July 1, 1969 need to be strengthened is irrelevant and preemptive because we had no duty

Page 4668 as a matter of federal law and under preemption

a matter of state law to strengthen the warnings

after July 1, 1969.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not a question of duty or liability.  It's a question of notice. Judge, they did strengthen the warnings after this in 1985.

MR. EDSON:  Because �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm sorry.

There's no legal basis.

MR. EDSON:  Right.  We don't want it

admitted because it's going to a preemptive

theory of liability.

THE COURT:  I thought you just showed me

one thing that was a problem.

MR. EDSON:  Well, I showed you, that's the

major conclusion of the paper.  That's the whole

point of it.

THE COURT:  Let me see the whole report.

MR. GDANSKI:  The thrust of the report is

the effect of advertising, persuasion anxiety

through advertising.  It has very little, if

anything, to do with increasing the strength of

the warnings.  Honestly, in the times I've used

this report in other trials, I don't recall

using it for that point ever.

THE COURT:  We're just going to redact what

I said to redact, and let's move on.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, in 1967, while the conspiracy

is ongoing and the defendants are making their public

statements, what did the Federal Trade Commission say

as to the impact and effect of the caution statement?

	Back to 1988 for a moment.  1988, Surgeon
	
General'
	s report comes out, establishes that nicotine
	
in cigarettes is addictive, right'
		p

A
	Yes.
	

Q
	So when that happened, did the tobacco
	
companie
	s go on TV again and attack the Surgeon
	
General?
	
	

A
	They did.
	

Q
	Did the Surgeon General

make its

A
	Yes.
	

Q
	Do we have examples and

the Surgeon General at the time?
		

A
	It was C. Everett Koop,

General

with the

THE WITNESS:  I think there was really

no � not much concern one way or the other.  It

was I think somewhat surprising how forceful he

was in some of his efforts.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's take a look at a clip.

We'll move it into evidence, PT 1777A.  We're

moving that into evidence along with 4725A.

THE COURT:  This evidence is only being

admitted for notice.  You may consider it as

evidence � you may not consider it as evidence

of the matters asserted in it, but only for

notice purposes.  That's my instruction to the

jury.  Let's go.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    This is Dr. Koop on TV, Surgeon General of

the United States at the time? A   Yes, 1988. Q    4725A and 1777A.  Let's see what he has to

say about the subject.

Page 4673 A new report from the Surgeon General of the

United States added a weapon for people who

oppose smoking and their representatives in

Congress.  It also drew fire from the tobacco

industry.  Medical correspondence Susan Sumpter

reports.

Surgeon General Koop drew his smoking gun on the tobacco industry today declaring what a lot of people who can't kick the habit already know, the nicotine in cigarettes is addictive, very addictive.

I would say it is just as addictive as heroin or cocaine.  Our nation has mobilized enormous resources to wage a war on drugs, illicit drugs.  We should also give priority to the one addiction, tobacco addiction, that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.

Anti-smoking groups said this report puts their fight on a new footing.

Because a finding that smoking is addictive knocks out the tobacco industry's number one argument; that is, the smokers smoke because of their free will.

Others say the official finding that smokers are addicted may actually help them

People should be encouraged.  Now we know what the nature of the beast is that's been controlling them.  It's a drug.

As expected, the Tobacco Institute called today's report unwarranted, saying that since people do quit smoking, tobacco clearly isn't addictive.  In response, the Surgeon General noted that some people also get off heroin.

Susan Sumpter, CBS News, Washington.

(Thereupon, the video concluded.)

MR. GDANSKI:  The other video. (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

SPEAKER:  The Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has issued two major reports on smoking, one on the dangers of secondhand smoke, the other on nicotine addiction.  The tobacco industry disputes both reports as more political than scientific.

We have been told so frequently by the cigarette industry that smoking is a matter of free choice, you start when you want and you quit when you want, but anybody who has ever smoked knows that is not true.

Page 4675 What does the record, the longtime record

say is the most dangerous age to get hooked on

tobacco?

The indications are very clear that the people who are most heavily addicted to nicotine and have the greatest trouble quitting are those who began smoking when they were 14 to 16.

I think the study said in � all over the world, in every country and every culture, the younger you start, the greater the addiction, and the more difficult it is to quit.

And you said that you consider tobacco as addictive as cocaine or heroin. Isn't that an overstatement?

No, I think the evidence is very clear if you understand what we're talking about. Addiction is a specific physiologic problem, and the manner in which you become addicted to nicotine is exactly the same manner in which you become addicted to cocaine or to heroin.  Even after you have quit and you think you're clean, there's a tremendous tendency to relapse.

There is no such thing as a safe cigarette. There's no such thing as a quality death. (Thereupon, the video was stopped.)

jury applies to both videos.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was this moment in 1988 a historic moment

from the public health community's perspective?

A    It was.

Q    Why is that?

A    It's the turning point when cigarettes,

specifically nicotine, are recognized as being highly

addictive.

Q    And tobacco is obviously on notice of

what's being said by Surgeon General Koop �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading.

Argumentative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Was the tobacco company on notice of what's

being said in these videos?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  That's not a proper

subject for expert testimony.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.

Sustained.

that they were paying attention to what was being

said publicly by the public health community about

smoking and addiction, including at this time in 1988

by Surgeon General Koop?

A    They were always paying close attention.

Q   Now, Dr. Proctor, we talked about advertising.  You're familiar with current day advertising of the tobacco companies?

A    Yes.

Q   You're familiar with this edition of Glamour Magazine?

A    I am.

Q   You've seen the cigarette ads contained in this magazine?

MR. FURR:  We object.

THE COURT: Do you-all need to approach on this?

MR. FURR:  Yes, we do. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  These recent magazines, current day content, advertising today are completely irrelevant to any issue in the case.

THE COURT:  What year?  What are the time periods?

MR. GDANSKI:  2010, '12, '13, and they are �

THE COURT:  So why am I letting those in?

MR. GDANSKI: The question in this case is going to be whether or not --

THE COURT:  First of all, they're hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, I'm not offering the ads to prove what's in the ads.

THE COURT: Sure, I understand that's your argument, but the point is that they're recent, so I don't know how they can really go to

MR. GDANSKI:  Again, I'm not going to argue notice for purpose of this.  The argument here is that ultimately there is going to be a question on the verdict form of whether or not there should be � punitive damages are warranted against the defendants.

I'm confident, Judge, that one point of law in the jury instructions on punitive damages is going to be what, if anything, the companies have done to mitigate the punitive damages, whether or not they should be warranted given how they have behaved since the end of the conspiracy.  They're going to say, we've admitted smoking is bad.  We have a web site now.  We don't currently conspire, et cetera, et cetera, and so, therefore, there should be no punitive damages.

Our position in this case is that they are still doing many things, many things which are misleading, which are fraudulent.  They've recently been found --

THE COURT:  What's the testimony that you're going to elicit that these particular ads are misleading?

advertisements in violation of the Master

Settlement Agreement.

THE COURT:  Rolling Stone Magazine is for kids under 18?

MR. GDANSKI:  Glamour.

THE COURT:  Now, is this going to the first phase of the punitive damages claim or the second phase?

MR. FURR:  It's not coming in in this phase.

What Mr. Gdanski wants to do is, he keeps saying he's introducing this in anticipation of us offering mitigating evidence.  Mitigating evidence is a defense that we might pursue.  We haven't done it.  He's bootstrapping �

THE COURT:  All right.  If they open up the door, then I might consider it at that point in time.  If they open up the door to that in their defense, I may open up the door and let you do it, but for now I'm sustaining the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  For every defense that they can have, I can put on a corresponding offense. That's what this would be.  I don't have to wait for their defense.

THE COURT:  At this point in time they're not � they're indicating that it may not be an issue in the case, and we're talking about documents that are otherwise hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  My point would be this.  If

MR. GDANSKI:  He's never talked about current advertising.  He's never talked about current conduct.  They've blocked it every time.

Q    Dr. Proctor, we're going to � are those

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Do the tobacco companies still advertise in

magazines that anybody can buy in a drug store or a

Publix or a Winn-Dixie or a 7-Eleven or gas station

or a Walgreens or a CVS?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance.

advertisements from some of the companies in

popular magazines.

	Sustained.
	

BY MR. GDANSKI:
		
	

Q
	PT 2009.
	
	


	MR. GDANSKI:
	We discussed

BY MR. GDANSKI:
		
	

Q
	Dr. Proctor,
	sometimes are
	the tobacco

companies
	the best at
	summing up what
	they did?

A
	They often are, yes.
		

Q
	This is PT 2009.  Let's take a look at it.
		
It's from
	February 19,
	1969, from Dr.
	Dunn, the

nicotine
	kids, to Dr.
	Wakeham, right?
	

A
	Yes.
	
	

Q
	It says confidential at the
		top, right?

A
	Yes.
	
	

Q
	This is at a point in time
		when the tobacco

companies
	are denying
	or not publicly
	stating that

nicotine
	is addictive,
	right?
	

A
	Correct.
	
	

Q
	They say, Our position should obviously be
		
supportive of jets for the primitive
			� that means

like the
	basic animalistic reason, ri
		ght?

A

Yes

Q   For the primitive reason of, quote, who ain't for more money, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    I would be more cautious in using the pharmic-medical model, do we really want to tout cigarette smoke as a drug?  It is of course, but there are dangerous FDA implications to having such conceptualization go beyond these walls. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q   This is 1969.  For how many years were the tobacco companies able to stave off FDA regulations? MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor.

Noerr-Pennington.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    In the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s, were the tobacco companies ever regulated by the Food and Drug Administration?

A    Never.

Q   Did the tobacco companies share this document where they say cigarette smoke is a drug?

A    No.

Q   Was this one of the documents that was

Page 4688 released publicly as a result of the litigation

process?

A    It was forced into the open, yes.

Q    In 1994, tobacco companies were asked to come before Congress, put under oath and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, tell us what you guys know, right?

A    Right.  The Waxman hearings in Congress.

Q    Who was Congressman Waxman?

A    He was a congressman from Southern California, who was in the Energy Commerce Department of the federal government.

Q    They were put under oath?

A    Yes.

Q    And what was it that brought this about? We're going to watch a clip now, but what was it that � just by way of background, that brought these folks, these CEOs, the heads and presidents of tobacco companies, to Congress to tell the truth?

A    There was an effort at this time beginning to really put cigarettes under the control of the FDA as a drug.  Whistleblowers had been bringing out documents, smuggling documents in their pants, things like that, and these came to the attention of the federal government.  So there were hearings where the

SPEAKER: Whether cigarette smoking causes cancer, your answer was, quote, I don't believe so.  Do you stand by that answer today?

I do, sir.

Do you understand how isolated you are in that belief from the entire scientific community?

I do, sir.

You're the head of a manufacturer of a product that's been accused by the overwhelming scientific community to cause cancer.  You don't know?  Do you have an interest in finding out?

Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed and you said, quote, To my knowledge, it has not been proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer. This is a rather passive and puzzling approach, especially in light of the consensus, not by some, but all of the scientific community.

I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes. Mr. Johnston?

We'll take that as a no.  Again, time is

short.  If you can just -- I think each of you

believe nicotine is not addictive.  We just

would like to have this for the record.

disease or was addictive, right?

He actually was not the CEO of Philip Morris.  He was the CEO of the parent company. It's in the transcript itself of what counsel wishes to play for them.

THE COURT:  Why don't I sustain the objection.  You re-ask the question.

MR. BRENNER:  Well, then I think it doesn't come in.  It's not a defendant in this case.

THE COURT:  It's not a defendant in this case?

MR. GDANSKI:  It is a defendant in this case.  At the time Philip Morris USA was wholly owned by its parent company.  I don't think there was a Philip Morris USA at the time.  They spun it off later and created Philip � I think that is the case.

MR. BRENNER:  You're incorrect.

THE COURT:  Are you saying that Mr. Bible had nothing to do with Philip Morris USA?

MR. BRENNER:  No.  I'm saying that Florida recognizes corporate distinction.  He was the chairman of what was called Philip Morris Companies is now called Altria.  They used to be a tobacco company, which there still is, which

So the fact that there is a corporate distinction is something that Mr. Gdanski doesn't like, but it's fully recognized.  He is the chairman of the holding company.

MR. GDANSKI:  He is in charge.  The man is in charge.  He owns the company that owns the company.

THE COURT:  I'm sorry, who does he work for?

MR. BRENNER:  At the time of his testimony, is what they're claiming, he worked for the holding company, which was called Philip Morris Companies.  That is now --

THE COURT:  Philip Morris Companies, are they a defendant in this case?

MR. BRENNER:  No, they're not.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So why should they answer?

MR. GDANSKI:  Philip Morris Companies owned Philip Morris USA.  Philip Morris USA was a wholly-owned corporate subsidiary.  It actually has very few employees.

argumentative.  This is cumulative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm talking about the

Congressional testimony.  It can't be

cumulative.  We just played it.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   Go ahead.

A    The whole point of the conspiracy was

obstruction, delay, denial, the whole point was to

keep the truth away from the people who needed to

know it the most.

Q    Did they do that for many, many decades

very successfully?

A    Yes.

objection, but the witness had already answered,

so I'm striking the last answer.  The jury

should disregard it.

	Q   This document is in evidence, Knopick to

3
	Klopfer, September of 1980.  It discusses some of the

4
	meetings that were taking place regarding whether or

5
	not NIDA, National Institute of Drug Abuse, wants to

6
	call cigarettes addictive?

7
	A    Yes.                                          1

8
	Q    It says, The National Institute of Drug

9
	Abuse wants addictive added to the cigarette warning.

10
	Do you see that?

11
	A    Yes.                                          1

12
	Q   Has that ever happened?

13
	A    It has not.  Well, no, with one close

14
	exception.

15
	Q   Okay.  It says, I wonder if the Institute

16
	was caught unaware on this matter.

17
	Do you see that?

18
	A    Yes.                                          1

19
	Q   Let's go to the bottom.

20
	It quotes a paper.  It says, Cigarette

21
	smoking is more addictive than using heroin, hooking

22
	two-thirds of the people who ever smoke.

23
	Is that scientifically true, Doctor?

24
	A    Yes.                                          1

It says then, I feel badly about my own

right ?

Defense says � this is their document,

Yes

Q    It says, The lawyers remind us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer or cigarette case. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q   We can't defend continued smoking as, quote, free choice, if the person was what?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. MR. GDANSKI:  I'll rephrase. THE COURT:  All right.  Rephrase. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    What did the industry in this document record for posterity's sake as to their ability to defend smoking as free choice if the person was addicted?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  We just read that language.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, at the end of the day, when you're looking at this document and looking at the documents we've looked at, what is the net effect in the big picture, the arc of the story, what's the net effect of the tobacco company's conduct?  Wrapping this up, what is the net effect, please?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative and argumentative.

A    The tobacco industry.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, there is an issue that Your Honor asked us to hold in abeyance, so at this moment --

THE COURT:  So you're done other than that issue?

MR. GDANSKI:  Dr. Proctor, this is the last time I get to ask you questions on direct.  I am truly thankful for your time.  It was a lot of days.  Thank you very much.

privilege log provided in this case, although,

the Court, nonetheless, despite the fact that

the privilege log wasn't provided, there was a

motion in limine, and the Court has conducted,

nonetheless, an in-camera inspection and taken

an evidentiary hearing or given the parties an

opportunity for an evidentiary hearing not once,

but twice, because when we had two days of

pretrial, I had a clerk available and was

prepared to take any evidence at that time and

was told that there was not going to be any

evidence presented on those two days of pretrial

hearings.

Today, I gave another opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, of which that was conducted today after an in-camera inspection.

What is the numbering system in order to read off the ones that I'm admitting on this basis?  What is the numbering system?  Where do I read off the numbers?

MR. GDANSKI:  I need to see what Your Honor is looking at.  We have them as PT numbers, not the Bates numbers on the bottom right-hand corner.

MR. GDANSKI:  We can probably figure it out.  We just need the Bates number of the first page.  It will take us a few extra minutes to figure out what you're talking about.

THE COURT:  Why don't you guys approach and show me where the Bates numbers are so I know.

Would those be the Bates numbers?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes.  Those are the Bates numbers.

Okay.  The whole number there?  So if I read that off, that will work?

MR. BRENNER:  Maybe do it a little slower, because we're going to have to track it down.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  You don't have to read for multipage documents.  We don't need every page.

THE COURT:  Just the front page?

MR. GDANSKI:  Exactly.

MR. BRENNER:  You're reading now the ones that you are admitting, right?

Court, based on the burden that has been met or

not been met by way of that evidentiary hearing

by my review on the face of the in-camera review

as well, having taken the evidence here as well

as what I've heard before, and listening to your

argument on the bases that I've already

indicated.

So the first one that would be admitted on that basis, on those bases and alternative bases is 505741150.

The next one would be 87715633.

Could you guys approach.  I want to find out if this got separated when we were doing the in-camera inspection.  If this cover belongs to this or if it belongs to something else.  Does anybody know what this one belongs to?

MR. GDANSKI:  That belongs to a � they're not part of the same document.

THE COURT:  Which document does it belong to?

MR. GDANSKI:  This one here belongs to a very large document, not all of which was given to Your Honor because it's about 500 pages long.

MS. LEHMAN:  Yes.

THE COURT:  You didn't give it to me for an in-camera inspection.  How am I going to conduct an in-camera inspection of this document?  This doesn't say anything to me.

MS. LEHMAN: Your Honor, we provided the entire document earlier in the week. This is the document.

THE COURT:  Nobody pointed out to me that it's � I don't recall receiving that thing earlier in the week.

MR. GDANSKI:  I thought you gave him that document.

THE COURT:  So an in-camera inspection of that has not occurred?

MR. BRENNER:  Yes.

THE COURT:  -- based on first amendment and lobbying issues and perhaps some other grounds.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  So this one is not being admitted yet, but it does overcome the privilege issue on the same basis.  However, it is subject to other objections, so it may not be admitted for that reason.

The next one is 640000547, 640000547. That's the end of the ones that overcome the privilege claim.

The ones that will not be admitted because they don't meet the crime-fraud exception, the Court finds they don't meet the crime-fraud exception, and as an alternative ground, the Court finds that they are cumulative is, and so, therefore, for both reasons, are not being admitted, is 690010946.

THE BAILIFF:  Court is in recess. (Whereupon, a recess was taken at 3:06 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Everybody in the room?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Could the Plaintiff address on this document what goes to future conduct?  This seems all to go to past conduct.  Is there something specific that went to future conduct? The Court could not find it in the time that was provided to the Court to do an in-camera inspection of it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, it's � incidentally, I think it has multiple references to future conduct and ongoing conduct.  If there's no problem, we can identify that at some other moment in time when Dr. Proctor is not here and give that to the Court for consideration.

THE COURT:  I thought the whole reason that you guys made me do this now was because you needed to do it with Dr. Proctor -- if I knew that from the beginning, we would have already had the jury in here.

It doesn't appear that it's necessary for this witness.  If I had been told that before, we would have had the jury out here already.

Where is the deputy?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Your Honor, if I may, while we're waiting on the deputy, I wanted to ask if you would consider an issue I understand that you had talked about before.

One of the reasons I was asked to come today is an issue that will be important for us

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I'm sorry, I was looking to see who was coming in.

Your Honor, it's about the admissibility of evidence regarding design of cigarettes.

THE COURT:  Have him bring the jury in. Let them know to be ready to go as soon as we call them in.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  About the cigarette design.

THE COURT:  I've already ruled on cigarette design with this witness.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  One of the things.

THE COURT:  I let him testify about it.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I do understand.  I'm sorry.  I'm not being clear.  I apologize.

About the specific kind of cigarette design, and that is low tar and light cigarettes.  It's my understanding, as I heard it, and looking back through the transcripts from the other day, that you were concerned that that kind of evidence should not be admissible here because we had not presented evidence

Page 4715 regarding whether or not this particular person

at issue in this trial that you're presiding

over had smoked those kinds of cigarettes.

I wanted to bring that to you just because, obviously, when I'm focusing on things, it's issues that I'll be focusing on, on appeal. Just yesterday, we received another ruling from another trial court adopting the argument that we have made to you.  I wanted to explain that to you very briefly.

For the record, that is the Tognoli case that Judge Murphy is presiding over.

The admissibility of that particular kind of design of cigarette, a low tar and light tar, is not contingent upon whether a person actually smoked it.  The fact that the cigarettes made that kind of design is relevant to two things.

The easiest one to explain, and this is what I got to talk with you a lot about when we met at the pretrial hearings, is punitive damages.  The point is that there are many different ways that the Defendants highly engineered cigarettes, and all of that was for the same purpose of manipulating the public's perception of cigarettes and of encouraging the

So said better here, now you know, from presiding over the trial, that one of the significant design changes by the Defendants was the filter.  That was in the 1950s, when the Defendants told everybody --

THE COURT:  I've already allowed that into evidence.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I understand.  My point is, and I'll move quicker, because I know you're up to speed on all this, but --

THE COURT:  You need to move quickly, because I need to get the jury out here.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  I will talk faster.

There is no noticeable difference for purpose of admissibility between the filter design and the low tar design.

THE COURT:  The only difference is that this Plaintiff smoked filtered, but the testimony is that, or at least what's been proffered to me, is that he never used low tars or light cigarettes.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  You're exactly right, but that is the state of the evidence right now.

What I'm trying to explain to you is why

there's no problem with cigarettes.  We're

investigating the addictiveness, and we're

investigating the harm, and we don't think

there's a problem, but just in case there is,

smoke filters, and just in case there is, smoke

lights.

So this was a continuation.  This is one aspect of the continuing campaign for those people who are currently smoking, no matter --

THE COURT:  All right.  Let me hear a response.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor � I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I don't mean to be disrespectful.  We've had this argument over and over and over again. We've had a full proffer on it.

For Ms. Humphries to walk into the courtroom after we've had three days of hearing this, and rehash -- she didn't say anything different than Mr. Gdanski said.  She said twice, three times --

THE COURT:  She has made a different argument.  The different argument that she has made is that the campaign -- that the advertising that went to the low tars would have

would have received that same information, and

that whether he picked up a low tar or not, that

the messaging in that advertising is applicable

to this Plaintiff.

That is a different argument than I heard from Mr. Gdanski.  I think he was making argument number one, but not argument number two.  There's two arguments that were made today.

Why don't you guys respond to argument number two.

MR. BRENNER:  Briefly, you went through a voir dire of the witness.  There was no conspiracy as to advertising.  What he said, the only thing they agreed not to do is not to say they're safer, which is exactly what they're saying they did.

So you've had a voir dire.  With all due respect, Your Honor, I think they did make this argument yesterday.  It's never going to end. We've litigated this issue two or three times. I don't know what we're doing.

Do you want to have briefs on it?  We can have briefs on it.  But to just walk up as the

This whole idea that --

THE COURT:  I don't think that we voir dired him on issue number two.  I think we voir dired him on issue number one.

MR. BRENNER:  We did voir dire him on the advertising issue.  We absolutely did.  And he said, the only conspiracy as to filters or lights was they all agreed not to say that they were safer.  It's actually the reverse sort of conspiracy, that they're now saying the advertisements told them they were safer.

You did have a voir dire on this very issue, Your Honor.

Look, the Plaintiffs -- Ms. Humphries, every time she walks into this courtroom, makes the same argument.  Their view of the world is anything bad the tobacco companies do, whether it has any impact whatsoever on the Plaintiff, is reprehensibility and goes to punitive damages.

Your Honor, I can't be prepared every 15 minutes for this issue to come back up.  As I told you before, it is a huge issue.  It is a separate case, lights.  You could have a whole case on lights.  There are whole cases on lights.  There have been multistate class actions on lights.  This is not a lights case. And it doesn't change because Ms. Humphries walks in in the middle of the proceedings and just says, I think it's now a case about lights, Your Honor.

With all due respect, we need to move on. If you're even considering this, I need to have some notice of it and brief it again to you.  I believe you have ruled on all of it repeatedly.

THE COURT:  I think it's become obvious now that we're not going to finish today with this witness, right?  You're going to have to bring him back a different day, right?

MR. FURR:  Yes.  Most likely for cross.

MR. EDSON:  I wasn't expecting this to come up today.

MR. EDSON:  What we do know is that, again, no conspiracy to market lights.  That was the extensive voir dire.  And this Plaintiff did not rely on any of what she's talking about.  We know that.  He never smoked those cigarettes. He never relied on it.

So it's a complete sidetrack, side trip that is only here to inflame the jury, to waste even more time.  We're in day five of this witness, direct.

We had, again, extensive voir dire on this. I don't know what else there is to say.

Page 4724 low tar cigarettes, were the same themes of health

reassurance used in those advertisements as were used

in filtered cigarette advertisements?

A    Yes.

Q    Can you just explain that to the Judge, please?

A    It's a continuation of a longer standing program of reassurance that goes back even prior to the conspiracy.  I think I mentioned there were early campaigns already in World War I claiming that a particular brand was tested.  There are later claims for menthol.  That was a form of medical reassurance that this would, by cooling the throat, would pose less danger.

Filters are the same themes. Low tars are the same themes. Lights are the same themes. These all were part of an effort to say it's safe to smoke.

Q    The Defendants marketed light and low tar cigarettes, obviously?

A    Yes.

Q    Did the marketing of light and low tar cigarettes, did that take place as part of the ongoing fraud to reassure the public?

A    Yes.  It's part of the fraud, yes.

Q    Did the marketing of the filtered

Page 4725 cigarettes, and cigarettes in general, filtered,

unfiltered, lights, low tar, did all of that take

place in combination with each other and as part of

the fraud to reassure the public?

A    Well, sure.

Q    Okay.  Were the Defendants saying that there are no dangers with cigarettes, but just in case, smoke filters or lights or low tar?

A    That's more or less what was going on. They never explicitly said low tars and lights were safer, but they implied safety.  The very word "filter," the very word "low tar," the very word "light," those implied safety, and they actually studied this issue intensively and they knew that smokers were perceiving them as safer.

Q    And did the marketing of the light and the low tar and the filtered cigarettes, as part of the health reassurance campaign, was that all engineered to give smokers the psychological crutch and the self-rationale to continue smoking as we saw in the 1966 document?

A    Yes.  That was really the design or the design fraud, I guess is the best way to put it, that was developed after that psychological crutch memo from 1964.

Page 4726 Q    Did these particular Defendants engage in

this message of promoting doubt through filters,

lights and low tar cigarettes?

A    Yes.

Q    Thank you.

THE COURT:  Any cross-examination subject to further cross-examination tomorrow? MR. FURR:  Yes, Judge. THE COURT:  Should you come up with additional questions after you've had more chance to prepare?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MR. FURR:

Q    Hi, Dr. Proctor. A    Hi.

Q    Just a few questions.  I want to be clear. You did say that the Defendants never expressly advertised to smokers that low tar or light cigarettes were safer; isn't that correct, sir?

A    With that exact language, that is true. They did the same thing with other language.  In other words, they used color coding.  They used terms like "filter," "low tar," the "intelligent choice," the choice, they would even say things like, if you

So it's indirect, but you're correct, they

never explicitly uttered those exact words that you

said.

Q   Wouldn't you agree that, as we've discussed already, there was no agreement among these Defendants to market low tar and lights as a health reassurance product?

A    I think it's fair to say that that is true with some qualifications.  In other words, it's true they did not collectively get together and plan marketing campaigns, because they are competitors in the marketplace.

On the other hand, they did endorse, support, create the entire apparatus that was connected with endorsing the filter fraud, namely, through using machines that they knew would not accurately represent actual deliveries into the lungs with the deception directed at the Federal Trade Commission.

We know there are documents that say keep the FTC machine method because it underestimates actual inhalation of poisons.  They knew those machine-measured techniques were underestimating actual deliveries, and they collectively embraced

But you're correct, they did not get

together and market because marketing was

competitive.  They each wanted to sell the most

light, low tar, lights.  So there's a sense in which

the fraud is parallel, and there's a sense in which

the fraud is collective.

Q    The Defendants are competitors in the marketplace, right?

A    Yes.

Q    To be colloquial, they want to eat each other's lunch in the marketplace, don't they?

A    Yes.

Q    In fact, R.J. Reynolds has eaten other companies, right?

A    They have, swallowed them �

Q    By beating them in the marketplace, right?

A    Yeah.

Q    Every day, the companies that are Defendants at this table compete with each other to take customers from each other, correct?

A    That's right.

Q    Identify for me, sir, every document that you are aware of that reflects an agreement among these companies to market low tar and light

A    Well, I told you that they are not agreeing on the marketing.  There is not a document like that. The agreements go to the general refusal to admit any harm from smoking, and the agreement to encourage the types of machines that they knew were fraudulent.  So it's kind of a fine point.

Q    Identify for me, Dr. Proctor, every document that you are aware of that reflects an agreement between Philip Morris, Reynolds, Liggett or any of Reynolds' predecessor companies to market cigarettes � to market low tar and light cigarettes in a way to promote doubt amongst smokers.

A    Well, the only one that comes to mind is the keep low numbers document, you know, keep the FTC method, the numbers are � it delivers low numbers, but --

Q    Is that a marketing document?

A    I don't remember if it's a marketing or a conspiracy document.  More likely a conspiracy document.

Q    Identify for me every document that you are aware of that reflects an agreement between these companies or their predecessors in interest that reflects an agreement demonstrating that low tar and

Page 4730 lights were developed and marketed to provide smokers

a psychological crutch, an agreement between the

companies.

A    Well, that term "psychological crutch" only appears once in the entire archive.

But, yeah, I can't think of one offhand. It wouldn't be a marketing document, anyway.  It would be a Committee of Counsel document.

Marketing, you know, the marketers are competitors.  The fraud occurs at a higher level than the marketing departments.  It's the Committee of Counsel level.

Q    The marketers designed their advertisements and promotions for low tar and light cigarettes, in part, to attract smokers of that product category from the other companies, their competitors, correct?

A    Definitely.  They wanted to, as you put it, eat the other's lunch.

Q    We didn't get to eat lunch today.  I'd like to eat lunch now.

I just want to be clear.  You mentioned this, you have woven into some of your answers this idea about fooling the FTC machines, correct?

their products in conformance with results of the FTC

testing as a matter of federal law, correct?

A    Yes, until 2008, when it's finally rejected as fraudulent.

Q    Beginning the 1970s the tobacco companies were required to list the tar and nicotine levels of any cigarette they sold on the advertising for that brand, correct ?

A    Based on those fraudulent machines, that's correct.

MR. FURR:  That's all I have, Your Honor. MR. GDANSKI:  I have a little bit of follow-up.

THE COURT:  Anybody else?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I will have to prepare a cross tomorrow.  I want the record to reflect these exact voir dire questions, this exact argument was made to you.  We had a whole -- and you -- it's the whole thing, whether part of the marketing, is the marketing of filters the same as the marketing of lights.

this, and for counsel to come with no notice to

us, and say, hey, we want to revisit this, ask

the Court to revisit it, I think it's highly

inappropriate.

I think, at the end of the day, you made a ruling, and part of the ruling was --

THE COURT:  These trials are not notice of -- everybody is on notice that there's a trial going on.  I'm not quite sure I understand your notice thing.  Things happen in trial.

MR. BRENNER:  But nothing happened.  Ms. Humphries showed up.

THE COURT:  Somebody has made a request for the Court to reconsider one of its prior rulings.  That happens all the time in trials.

So I don't know why you think you're entitled to special magical notice by me.

MR. BRENNER:  Not by you.  Not by you.  I think I'm entitled to notice by my opposing counsel before they march up as the jury comes in and says, hey, we want to revisit an issue you guys have been litigating for the last week when I wasn't here to litigate it with you.

MR. BRENNER:  No.  That's not what I said.

What I said, Your Honor, is on page 3, the whole � just so we know what it is, the quote, unquote, public relations sham that they want to put in front of the jury is the dichotomy of having � being able to defend a case in a lawsuit, say, for example, in a lawsuit that smoking doesn't cause someone's harm, and the dichotomy of that versus what the public's position is.

Anything to do with how we defend individual lawsuits -- this is what they want to put in, Your Honor.  They want to be able to say, this is the tobacco company's strategy. They're going to play hard ball with the victims of cigarette smoking lawsuits.

What's the purpose of that other than to inflame this jury for the way we're defending

we wouldn't do that, but what is the other

relevance of that?

So what I've said to Mr. Gdanski is, if you have stuff that doesn't go to legislation, and if you have stuff that doesn't go to individual lawsuits, I'm happy to look at it, but we've obviously reached an impasse.

So that paragraph --

THE COURT:  What else do you suggest should be taken out instead?

MR. BRENNER:  From the paragraph that he wants to play, I think it should be taken out all the way, starting at, in the litigation venue.

THE COURT:  Down to the end of that whole paragraph, everything that's highlighted in here is what you're saying?

MR. GDANSKI:  Essentially, they're saying the whole document shouldn't be used.

THE COURT:  Well, no, he's saying this paragraph, right?

MR. BRENNER:  I'm saying that paragraph should come out.  That's all he told me he wants to put in.

use is the part they want out.  I'll agree that

the part about regulation or legislation should

come out consistent with Your Honor's order.

The part about litigation has been fair game throughout. It's been consistent. I'm keeping consistent with Your Honor's ruling. They're trying to, essentially, deviate from that and I just want to use it the way Your Honor permitted me to use other documents.

If it had regulation or legislation, I agreed it should be taken out consistent with your ruling.  Litigation, different ruling. That's the whole point.

MR. GUEST:  That's not entirely accurate, Your Honor.  As you know, yesterday, you did sustain an objection based on plaintiff's counsel's use of documents that insinuated there is something wrong about how defendants were defending litigation in the past, because it could be connected to how the Defendants are defending this case today.

MR. BRENNER:  It's a 4 03 argument, obviously.  Anytime they're starting to bring in how we're defending individual lawsuits is ripe

Dr. Proctor, before we ask some final

questions based on the Judge's prior ruling, I

need to read into the record some evidentiary

documents that have come into evidence based on

the Court's ruling during that lengthy break.

The following documents have been admitted

into evidence as Your Honor indicated over the

break to both parties.  The objections of the

Defendants have been overruled.

It's PT 1201, PT 1524, PT 1525, PT 1542, PT

1911, PT 1913, PT 2038, PT 2027 and PT 2268.

Those are the documents that Your Honor has

ruled admissible.  We move them into evidence.

MR. FURR:  I believe that accurately

reflects your rulings, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  So those will be

admitted into evidence as previously stated on

the record by the Court.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

Q    Dr. Proctor; in light of that; as you can imagine; there's been objecting and some things the Court had to rule on.  Now they're in evidence.  I want to ask you some questions about a couple things before the Defendants have their opportunity; okay?

Q   We had shown some documentation of that.

A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  Do we also have a record of the correspondence and communications as it relates to Brown & Williamson between Brown & Williamson counsel and their outside counsel, private hired, retained law firms from New York City as to what they should share and what they should do?

A    Yes.

Q   All right.  This is in evidence.  Let's take a look at the first one.  It's 1524.

This is at the top, strictly private and confidential, Brown & Williamson, cigarette suits.

company in litigation.

A    Correct.

Q    It says, Pursuant to my telephone conversation with you and Jim Ravlin on Friday, and my conversation with you today, please find enclosed the substance of a proposed letter to the Surgeon General's advisory committee on smoking and health.

Who wrote the letters ultimately to the Surgeon General's advisory committee? Was it the scientists or the lawyers?

A    The lawyers are governing what can or can't be said to the Surgeon General's committee.

Q    Let's go to the next section.

MR. GDANSKI:  Just the first part.  There

you go.  Thanks, Rob. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    It says, I'm of the further opinion that any description in a letter to the committee of the methods and steps involved in the various scientific research programs conducted by Brown & Williamson must necessarily be so what?

Q    What's important about the fact that, ultimately, they made it so vague and irksome � so vague and incomplete as to be irksome to the reader?

A    Well, not only were they sowing doubt and confusion to the public, they were also sowing doubt and sowing confusion and irksomeness to the Surgeon General's committee.

Q    Let's go to page number 2.  Well, lets go down to the bottom.  It says, I repeat, it is unfortunate that Brown & Williamson must submit anything, but this approach seems to be, seems to me to be the most innocuous of the alternatives, right?

Q    From a litigation standpoint, I believe it axiomatic, that it is best to submit the least scientific material possible, consonant with the objective of not irritating the committee. Do you see that?

A    Yes.

Q    Did they do that?

A    They did that.

Q    Let's go to another one just like this.  PT 1542.

Same thing.  It's to Addison Yeaman, also at Brown & Williamson, right?

A    Yes.

Q    And it's from the same author and it's regarding cigarette suits.  This is from May 1963, before the Surgeon General's report came out, right?

A    Yes.

So did they willingly and happily turn over

their materials?

A    No.  They would have preferred to not have to file anything.

Q    Let's go down to the next section. Although we do not � MR. GDANSKI:  You have to show the top

section, Rob, so we know what that is. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    It says, In my opinion, paragraph 2 on the first page should be eliminated completely.  This paragraph reads as follows: Although we do not feel that any direct connection has been established between smoking and health, we do recognize our responsibility and that of the industry to prepare ourselves to deal usefully with any possibility, no matter how remote. Right?

A    Yes.

Q    So the section that dealt with recognition of responsibility, the lawyer recommended it be eliminated completely.

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   What did the lawyer recommend be done to the sentence in the section that dealt with the tobacco company's recognition of their responsibilities?

A    That it be deleted.

Q The first clause of paragraph 2 appears to me to contain a possible implication that, while Brown & Williamson does not feel there is any direct connection between smoking and health, it believes there may be an indirect connection. In my opinion, this implied admission might prove harmful in a lung cancer case.

Dr. Proctor, were they worried, were they concerned that what they said might be harmful to them in a tobacco case?

A    Yes, that was part of the conspiracy.

Q   The last clause of the sentence contains the possible implication of Brown & Williamson believes that any connection between smoking and health is remote.  As we have frequently discussed with the passing of time, so this is now 1963, right?

A    Yes.

That means the defense in a claim in a

courtroom that it's all the smoker's fault, right?

A    Yeah, blame the victim.

Q   So the defense of assumption of risk and contributory negligence will loom increasingly more important.

Is that what they're saying?

A    Yes.

Q   So they're saying, as time passes, our defense that it's the victim's fault will be more important, right?

A    Yes.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  He just

A    Yes.

Q   But then they say, Yet, the validity of these defenses, referring to the "it's all your fault defense," right?

Q    What does it mean? A    I think it means what it says. Q    The validity of these defenses is being whittled down by tobacco company utterances to the effect that there is no risk or that it is remote. So, ultimately, after acknowledging that the tobacco company statements, that there's no risk or that it's remote, did they acknowledge, Dr. Proctor, that those statements, no risk, it's remote, it's not proven, we need more evidence, did they acknowledge that that will and is a response to the claim that it's all the smoker's fault?

Page 4748 Q    In this period of time in the 1950s and

60s, while they're writing this internally, did they

publicly maintain that cigarettes were wholesome?

A    Yes.

Q    What does that mean?

A    Well, that there was no fault, that the product was healthy, wholesome, good for you.  I've seen that in litigation testimony.

Q    PT 1911, let's take a look at that.

Let's just � this is a document, April 20, 1992.  Lorillard, CTR inquiry, right?

Q   Let's go to page number 2, please.

It says, In my overcautious view, the Jensen issue.

That Jensen is the scientist they're funding who's not actually doing any research?

out of CTR, joint industry funds administered through

Dr. Proctor, the question is, did the

question.  The jury should disregard it.

Q   What does this document demonstrate as to whether or not the tobacco companies purchased favorable judicial testimony?

A    They did.

Q    In doing so, in purchasing favorable judicial testimony, what does this document demonstrate as to whether or not the purchasing of favorable judicial testimony was part of a perpetuation of a fraud on the public?

A    That's what it actually says.

Was radon one of the alternative causes that tobacco companies and their lawyers would point to as causing disease instead of smoking?

Q   Lest some lawyer be looking over our shoulder, I do not concede that even one person dies of a chronic disease that is caused by smoking cigarettes.  Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  That is all I'm saying, right?

A    Yes.

Q   Dr. Proctor, how many people were dying at that time from smoking cigarettes?

THE COURT:  Yeah. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Mr. Gdanski has argued to the jury that this conduct reflected in this document is part of the fraud.  That's why we have this document.  He argued it satisfies the crime-fraud exception.

He now just asked a question of this witness to confirm that the fraudulent conduct that was the basis of the last question he asked has consisted until this day, i.e., to this trial in the larger --

At this point, I think that counsel has clearly violated the Perrotto decision and other Fourth DCA cases by attacking defense of counsel in this lawsuit of the case.

MR. GDANSKI:  Absolutely not.

THE COURT:  There was no answer to the question.  How do you move for mistrial on a question?  There was a question asked, there was no answer given.

And I'll remind the lawyers in this case that I have consistently, consistently and repeatedly, despite the fact that nobody listens to me, said when you make an objection, stand up.  And I've told the witness, when the witness sees the questioner -- the objector standing up, he's not to answer.

You all continue to make objections sitting down.  And so you're not giving me the tool that I've given you to prevent the witness from blurting out an answer by doing the objections

So I know it's a long trial.  I know everybody is exhausted.  You know, I don't want to hear motions for mistrial when you all don't even follow the procedures I do to make sure that doesn't happen.

It didn't happen in this case because an answer wasn't given.  I don't understand a motion for a mistrial based on a question that hasn't been responded to.

I'11 strike the question, but it really is � it's not necessary, because an answer has not been given.

MR. BRENNER:  I would just weigh in, Your Honor, to say that the record will be what it will be, and we'll all be able to look at it, but the amount of times that just the lawyer asking questions over and over � the amount of times that Mr. Gdanski, in the examination of Dr. Proctor has asked highly inflammatory, objectionable questions either causing you to sustain objections and/or strike the witness'

Page 4755 answer has a pervasive effect on this jury.

It's over and over and over again.  Many times, you've had to admonish counsel from the bench to move on, because he'll just ask the same question knowing it's areas he can't go into.

So, Your Honor, yes, we try to stand up every time.  It's hard.  The witness answers quickly.  Sometimes Mr. Gdanski talks very fast, I don't think he's doing it on purpose.  I have the same affliction.  We're trying to do it. It's not always possible to stop the witness' answer unless you instruct the witness to wait a full second, and that's not � then he'd be on for 10 days.

We're trying to follow Your Honor's order, but I also think that the way counsel has repeatedly asked questions that are clearly objectionable has a pervasive effect on the jury.

THE COURT:  In this particular case, there was no answer.

MR. BRENNER:  I didn't hear one either, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  So let's proceed.

stricken. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Dr. Proctor, during the course of the denials from the tobacco companies that anything was wrong with smoking, and during the period of time when they denied that anybody died of a chronic disease caused by smoking, was the fear of a lawyer looking over their shoulder one that had significant public health ramifications?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Lest some lawyer be looking over our shoulder, was that a fear the tobacco companies had?

A    It was.

Q    And in response to that fear, did they maintain public positions in furtherance of their campaign of denial?

A    Yes.

Q   And as a result of that, were people

Q    Sir, you understand, don't you, that this

jury will be asked to fill out a verdict form that

contains some very specific questions with respect to

the claims that Mr. Shulman is making in this case.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Same objection,

Judge, about a verdict form.  There's no verdict

form decided by the Court yet.  I object.

Relevance.  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  I don't think he's

asking for a specific verdict form, just one in

general.

MR. GDANSKI:  My objection is, this is

nothing to do with Dr. Proctor's testimony.

It's irrelevant to his testimony.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Sir, you do understand who the Plaintiff is

in this case, don't you?

tumors.

cancer, wouldn't it?

no harm was admitted by the industry, and the whole

conspiracy was about all harm, which, of course,

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Dr. Proctor, the question was, when

you mentioned bladder tumors, that was in the context

of people being exposed to polycyclic hydrocarbons by

virtue of their occupational exposure in the

petrochemical industry, right?

A    That's right.

MR. FURR:  I'd like to have the Elmo,

please.

MR. GDANSKI:  Can I see what you're going

to show?

MR. FURR:  I'm only showing one of the

demonstratives that you used.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, during your direct

examination, you were shown the following

demonstrative by Plaintiff's counsel.

Would you please verify that for me?

A    Yes.

Q    This is, as you've explained to the jury � MR. FURR:  Can you enlarge that? BY MR. FURR:

Q    You explained to Mr. Gdansk! what the historical records show with respect to the way that the male lung cancer rate had risen, and the words you used were in parallel, or as a parallelism with respect to cigarette consumption, correct?

A    Correct.

Q    You explained to this jury that that was one of the factors that was used to identify, in fact, that cigarettes were a cause of lung cancer, correct?

A    One of them, yes.

Q    Now, sir, you did not show the jury a similar type of demonstrative for the way the incidence of bladder cancer correlates with the consumptions of cigarettes, did you, sir?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  It's

outside the scope.  It calls for medical

testimony.  It's argumentative as well.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

Q    Sir, a similar type of graph could be

constructed for whether or not bladder cancer

correlates with the consumption of cigarettes,

correct?

A    That's correct.

MR. GDANSKI:  Object, Judge.  Same

objection.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    In fact, you are familiar with and have

looked at the historical data in the way in which

bladder cancer has correlated with smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge.

Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  The objection is that it's outside the scope to discuss the historical data on bladder cancer.  They just demonstrated that we did not talk about that.  They can't now talk about it.

Plus, they're clearly trying to use Dr. Proctor as some kind of medical witness to talk about the medical issue of how --

THE COURT:  You can address that on redirect.  Overruled.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not redirect if it's improper for cross.

THE COURT:  Overruled. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  On the objection that it's beyond the scope of cross, I can reopen direct examination.  It's not a problem.  Let's go.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to elect not to ask � I'm going to object now.

Page 4770 same type of analysis that underlies the testimony

that you gave about lung cancer in cigarette

consumption, you would expect that, if bladder cancer

were strongly associated with cigarette smoking, you

would expect to see an increase in the rate of

bladder cancer somewhat similar to the increase in

the rate of lung cancer that you explained to the

jury, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Object.  Speculative and

calls for medical testimony.  I object.

MR. FURR:  This was the basis of the

testimony this witness gave underlying �

MR. GDANSKI:  And to the speaking

objections as well.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Let me read

the question.

Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No, you would not, because

unlike lung cancer, bladder cancer is more

weakly associated with smoking.  About half of

all bladder cancers are caused by smoking,

whereas 95 percent of all lung cancers are

caused by smoking.  There's a second key

difference.

Bladder cancer can be strongly caused by

Page 4771 occupational exposures.  There are plants where

19 out of 20 workers got bladder cancer as a

result of exposure to chemical carcinogens at

the workplace.  As a result of that, you would

not expect there to be the degree of parallelism

that you find in the lung cancer case.  You

would not expect the same degree of parallelism

with bladder, even though there is a strong

association.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    All right.  I'm going to ask you this very

specifically, sir.

If bladder cancer � if bladder cancer was

strongly associated with cigarette smoking, you would

expect to see age-adjusted bladder cancer mortality

rates increase substantially in the period between

1950 and 1977, wouldn't you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Disputes the

findings.  Calls for speculation.  There's a

finding that bladder cancer is caused by

smoking.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  You would expect there to be

a correlation, but it depends a lot on the

absence or presence of other confounding

were more important in a particular period of

history, you would expect that to swamp the

smoking affect.  So there's some crucial details

there. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, do you remember giving a deposition in this case?

A    Yes, I do.

Q    In fact, you gave that deposition on March 23rd of this year.

Does that sound about right?

A    It does.

Q    You told this jury that you've been deposed many, many times, haven't you?

A    Yes.

Q    You understand the importance of depositions, don't you?

A    I do.

Q    You understand that the party prepared to defend and prosecute their case is based, in part, upon what the witnesses say in depositions, don't you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object to that question.

It's got no relevance, how they prepare.

Page 4776 Are you aware of a diagnostic limitation

for bladder cancer occurring between the 1950s and

the 1970s?

Your answer was:  I'm not.

Correct?

A    That's right.

Q    Sir, in fact, based upon your review of the historical record, isn't it true that the age-adjusted bladder cancer mortality rate in the United States did not go up substantially between 1950 and 1977?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Discussing mortality.  I object.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's right, yeah, because bladder cancer becomes more and more curable, unlike lung cancer, where, essentially, every diagnosis ends in death.  That's one of the reasons you have to be careful about whether you're talking about mortality or morbidity, which are quite different.  In bladder cancer, unlike lung cancer, a person diagnosed with lung cancer, may well, and is, in fact, more likely to be cured than someone who suffers lung cancer.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    When did bladder cancer become much more curable?  Can you give us a time frame?

A    I think it's continuously more curable. It's more operable than lung cancer.  In other words, lung cancer is kind of the unusual.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that the historical records shows that the rate of bladder cancer deaths in this country between 1930 and 1978 did not increase?

A    Yes, that's right.  It's actually mainly because of the cleaning up of the environment.  The early petrochemical causes of bladder cancer were really centered around the World War I and shortly thereafter, when you had lots of people working with very dangerous chemicals in the workplace.

Those -- there are laws passed that really cleaned up the workplace pretty much.  And as a result, the beta-Naphthylamine and other bladder carcinogens largely disappeared, and smoking becomes more important.  But that's one reason you get a fairly flat line.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that between 1930 and 1978 the rate of bladder cancer was, essentially, a flat line?

answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I just gave you the

reason for that.  The workplaces cleaned up and

this, you know, it balances the effect.  So you

have smoking causing more and more bladder

cancer, but occupation causing less and less.

That's why you get a flat line.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    So it was because occupational exposures to

substances in the workplace that caused bladder

cancer decreased over that time, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  It's

outside the scope.

Can I have a continuing objection to this

line of questioning?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.  That's my view.

Page 4779 each year, you see none of the parallelism that you

see for lung cancer, correct?

A    There's definitely much less parallelism, because, again, as I've said, almost every lung cancer is directly caused by smoking, but only about half of all bladder cancers are caused by smoking. So that's a key difference.

Q    Okay.  I want to follow up.

You understand that the cancer that Mr. Shulman is complaining about in this case is bladder cancer, correct?

A    I've heard that, yes.

Q    You understand that two of the claims in this case, because you and Mr. Gdanski have talked about them at length, are that Mr. Shulman's bladder cancer was caused, in part, by concealment of information by these Defendants, and an agreement to conceal information, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I'm going to object to

Mr. Furr reciting what the legal claims are in

the case to this witness.  I object.  Your Honor

will give the jury the law, not counsel.

MR. FURR:  Those were discussed throughout

the case by Mr. Gdanski, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  I also object,

You and Mr. Gdansk! talked a great deal in

the past five days about concealment of information

by the Defendants with respect to the health risks of

smoking and what you claim the impact of that

concealment to have been on smokers, correct?

A    That's true.

Q    I want to be more specific now with respect

to your understanding of whether there is evidence

that the Defendants concealed information about

bladder cancer, okay?

A    Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge.  It's not

just a bladder cancer.  It's all cancers.  I

object.

already known to the public health community,

correct?

A That's right. They knew the truth. They knew that it did cause bladder cancer and concealed that.

MR. FURR:  I move to strike everything

after that's right, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  Absolutely not.  I object to

that.  He gave a fully responsive answer.  He

can explain the answer.

THE COURT:  I'm going to deny the motion to

strike.

Ask your next question. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Same type of question, Dr. Proctor.  You do not have any evidence that Philip Morris or Liggett or any of the United States tobacco companies that were manufacturing cigarettes during Mr. Shulman's smoking had any information establishing that smoking was causing bladder cancer that was not already known to the public health community?

A    Exactly the same answer.  They knew what the public health community knew and concealed it.

Q    They didn't have any information that the

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  What was that

question?  They didn't have any information that

the public health had?  I object.

THE COURT:  Let me ask �

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think that was a

question.

THE COURT:  Reask your question.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    With respect to bladder cancer and smoking

causing bladder cancer, none of these tobacco

companies had any information that the public health

community didn't already have, correct ?

MR. GDANSKI:  Object.  Asked and answered

the third time.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    All right.  I want to turn to asking you a

few questions about, some further questions about

Mr. Shulman, and how your testimony in this case

relates to Mr. Shulman, okay?

A    Sure.

Q    During your direct examination, you and

Mr. Gdansk! spent a lot of time discussing statements

Sir, you don't have any information that

anyone else ever saw any of those statements by the

tobacco companies and relayed them to Mr. Shulman, do

you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  That's

speculative.  Outside the scope.  And you

already said he doesn't know anything about

Mr. Shulman.

MR. FURR:  It's not speculative, I'm asking

him what he knows.

THE COURT:  Please don't argue with each

other.  I need the objections in one or two

words.  That's it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Asked and answered.

THE COURT:  I've already heard your

objections:  Asked and answered, speculative,

outside the scope.  That's what you said, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Correct.  As I said, I don't

know what he knew from any source.  I thought I

made that clear.

the dangers of smoking when he was smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Object.  It's been asked and answered.

THE WITNESS:  Right. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I just said I don't know what it is he knew, so how would I possibly know what you just asked. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Not only do you not know what he knew, you don't know when he was exposed to information about the dangers of smoking, do you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Asked and answered.  Argumentative now.

MR. FURR:  It's a different question. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That would follow logically. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You don't know what information he was exposed to about the dangers of smoking, do you?

A    No.  Again, I must not be making myself clear.  I apologize for that.  I don't know what he knew in any sense of the word, however you ask it. Q    I'm probably just slow on the uptake.  I

Q    You don't know what Mr. Shulman did or the actions that he took based upon information that he received about the dangers of smoking, do you?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. GDANSKI:  He's badgering the witness. He's repeatedly, repeatedly making the same point.  They've just had sort of an almost funny, in-courtroom humor discourse, about whether or not one of them is paying attention to the other.  Because one keeps asking the same question, and one keeps giving the same answer.

He's asking, you don't X, Y, Z about Mr. Shulman, and Dr. Proctor, repeatedly, I told you, I don't know anything about Mr. Shulman.  I won't know -- whatever question you're about to ask me about Mr. Shulman, I won't know the last question or the next question if it's about Mr. Shulman.

He's made the point clear.  He doesn't know about Mr. Shulman.  I made the point clear.

Page 4787 Mr. Furr is doing it again.  Your Honor

permitted it once, twice, and a third time.

This is now the fourth or fifth time.  It's

clear.  It's argumentative.  It's badgering and

it's repetitious.

MR. FURR:  I will reply when Mr. Gdanski is done.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm now done.

MR. FURR:  I'm handing the Court the leading case in the Fourth DCA with respect to the scope of cross-examination.  This is the Dempsey versus Shell Oil case.  We've highlighted the copies of the case, handed both to the Court and to opposing counsel.

The Shell Oil case makes this proposition abundantly clear.  You cannot provide some facts to your expert -- which clearly some facts were provided to this expert.  He was told where Mr. Shulman grew up, when he was born, what he did for an occupation, what type of disease he has, et cetera.  He was told all those things � but then withhold other facts from your witness in an effort to prevent him from being cross-examined.  You can't --

MR. FURR:  You can't do that.  In fact, as

the opinion clearly states, When the direct

examination opens up a general subject, the

cross-examination may go to any phase and may

not be restricted to mere parts or to the

specific facts developed by the direct

examination.  Cross-examination should always be

allowed relative to the details of an event or

transaction, a portion only of which has been

testified to on direct examination.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.

Q    I'11 be happy to repeat it.

actions Mr. Shulman took or the choices that he made

based upon the information that he received about the

dangers and addictive properties of smoking, do you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Asked and

he said, what he heard, what he was exposed to.

you'

A

Yes

Q    Sir, you and Mr. Gdanski also spent a lot of time over the past five days talking about statements made by the Tobacco Institute, the CTR, and its predecessor organization, the TIRC, right?

A    Correct.

Q    You spent a lot of times that were made by representatives of those organizations with respect to the dangers of smoking, right?

A    That's correct.  As I've said, I don't know what he was exposed to.  That includes the Frank Statement and everything else.

Q    You don't have any evidence that Mr. Shulman made any decisions about cigarette smoking in reliance of the statements contained in the Frank Statement, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  This is

cumulative, it's repetitive, and it's badgering. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  That's right.  I thought I'd

said this quite a few times.  I don't know what

he was exposed to, so how would I know that. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You do know that the Frank Statement was made in 1954, correct?

A    I do.

Q    You do know that Mr. Shulman was 20 � was born in 1920, don't you?

right ?

A    That would follow, yes.

Q    You are aware, based upon what Mr. Gdanski provided to you about Mr. Shulman's occupational history, that Mr. Shulman was well on his way to becoming a very successful businessman, wasn't he? MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object, Judge. This is outside the scope.  Mr. Shulman as a businessman.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't dispute that, but I don't recall.  I don't recall anything about his biography. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You know that Mr. Shulman is a highly intelligent man, don't you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge.  I object. I don't know how many times he made the point clear.  I object.  This is outside the scope and repetitive and argumentative and badgering. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't know anything

Page 4794 about his intelligence or his biography or what

he saw or didn't see. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You know, don't you, that Mr. Shulman was a voracious reader of newspaper?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge.  This is

just -- it's just arguing with the witness.  I

object.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I just don't know one

way or the other. BY MR. FURR:

Q    I want to talk with you a little bit about advertising and Mr. Shulman.  You and Mr. Gdansk! discussed at length last week advertising campaigns that the various tobacco companies had over the years for different types of cigarettes, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    You showed advertising to the jury that ran on TV, right?

A    Yes.

Q    You also showed the jury print advertisements, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    And one of the things we testified to about

Page 4795 at length was that � your opinions that those

advertisements glamorized smoking, correct?

A    Yes.  They were part of the culture of glamorizing smoking, making it more normal.

Q    With respect to male smokers, one of the things that you told this jury was that those advertisements made smoking seem very masculine or macho, correct ?

A    Or feminine.  A lot of them made them seem feminine, patriotic.  Every cultural theme that was used that was popular was used to sell cigarettes. Masculinity would be just one of many.

Q    You haven't seen any evidence that Mr. Shulman came to believe that smoking was glamorous or masculine or conferred any other attribute on the smoker, have you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object again,

Judge.  This is absolutely repetitive.

MR. FURR:  It's a new topic, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I apologize.  I must

not have made myself clear.  I don't know what

he saw, what he knew, what he was exposed to.  I

guess I've said that maybe seven or eight times. BY MR. FURR:

Mr. Shulman's brand history, don't you?

Could I have � Dr. Proctor, do you have your deposition up here still, sir?

A    Yes, I do.

Q    Let me ask you to turn to page 10 through 11 of your deposition and ask you to read to yourself, please, sir, beginning on line 22 on page 10 down through line 24 on page 11.

MR. GDANSKI:  Ten � say that again,

please.

MR. FURR:  Yes, page 10, line 22, and most

of the next page except the last line. THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Sir, prior to your deposition, you had a meeting with Mr. Gdanski, didn't you?

A    Yes.

Q    Mr. Gdanski provided you some background basic information about Mr. Shulman, correct?

Q    One of the things Mr. Gdansk! told you was that Mr. Shulman's brand history was Lucky Strike cigarettes, Old Gold �

MR. GDANSKI:  I object. BY MR. FURR:

Q    � Chesterfield, English Ovals and Marlboro, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Counsel, will you provide me the courtesy of not speaking while I object.

THE COURT:  Actually, you're supposed to wait for his question to finish and then you are supposed to object.  That's the whole purpose of standing.  You were actually interrupting him.

MR. GDANSKI:  May I approach?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Judge, I was asking about the brands he smoked.

MR. GDANSKI:  He asked me what I said, what I told him, what I, out of court, told Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  You went into it in questions with him.  Why wouldn't he do that on cross?

MR. FURR:  That's the information he gave

Mr. Gdanski brie

Chesterfield, English Oval and Marlboros for the last

few decades, correct?

A    Yes, I guess so.  That's what I said.

Q    Sir, the information that you were provided was that Lucky Strike cigarettes was Mr. Shulman's first brand, correct?

A    I believe so.  I don't have a good recall of that, but I don't dispute it.

Q    Isn't that the sequence with which you listed them in your deposition?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    Sir, you haven't seen any evidence that Mr. Shulman started smoking Lucky Strike cigarettes because of advertisements, have you?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  This is

repetitive.  Asked and answered. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  I haven't.  I don't know

anything about his life.  I'm not an expert on

him.  I'm an expert on American tobacco culture,

not on what they did to anyone personally. BY MR. FURR:

with any information that he acquired about the

dangers of smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Could have saved 30 minutes. I object.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, you said it better than I could have.  I tried to say it 12 times but you put it all in one basket. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Thank you.

Sir, you agree, don't you, that different individual smokers make different value decisions with respect to how they value the risk or benefits of smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I have to object. That's speculative, different smokers' evaluations of the risks, I don't know who or what Mr. Furr is talking about.  I object.  And it's outside the scope.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, this is another speaking objection.  I don't want to violate the Court's order by responding from here. THE COURT:  Hang on a second. Overruled.

Q    Well, you say � you've told us, I guess by your count, 13 times that you don't know anything about Mr. Shulman other than some bare bones background facts, correct?

Q    You know that prior to trials like this

one, the sworn depositions are taken of witnesses

like yourself, right?

Q    And your expectation would be that, prior

to this trial beginning, that sworn depositions would

have been taken of people that had firsthand fact

information about Mr. Shulman, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  Can we

approach?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  This is harassing. I object.  This is harassing.  It's repetitive. It's badgering the witness.  But more fundamentally, it is what the tobacco companies consistently accuse everyone of doing to them, it is attacking our prosecution of the case.

THE COURT:  The only question that I've got right now is in your expectation prior to the trial beginning that sworn deposition is taken from a person -- what is so badgering about that?

MR. GDANSKI: Obviously that specific question about whether there's depositions taken, but the entire �

THE COURT:  One question at a time.  You were allowed to ask lots of questions.

MR. GDANSKI:  They've been going for 4 0 minutes and he asked the same question 14 times. Your Honor overruled every one of my objections.

Page 4806 MR. BRENNER:  In all honesty, Judge, this

has happened with every witness.  There's no

chance at 5:30 to 7:00 these jurors are as

attentive as they are in the mornings.  Every

witness the defense has been cross-examining --

they had this witness on for almost five full

days while we're trying to sort of cram

everything in a half day or so.  I think it is

unfair to the defense.  This witness is going to

be on the stand tomorrow, I can assure you, no

matter what time you go to.  We object to going

that late.  It's not fair to the defense.  Every

time we get the jury tired.  We had one that I

had to cram my cross in because the juror had to

go to a meeting.

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll see how they do.  My understanding from the deputy is they have no problem with staying tonight.

MR. BRENNER:  If you asked them � it's just human nature.

THE COURT:  I understand what you are saying, but we've got to get this case done.

MR. BRENNER:  Why are we always the ones taking the brunt of it?

dates when the plaintiff has been going.

MR. BRENNER:  Actually, Judge, I think it's only when cross is on.

THE COURT:  It's coincidental then.

MR. BRENNER:  I know you're not intending, but I am saying it is what's happening.

MR. FURR:  The witness will be here most of the day tomorrow, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I understand that, but the way you guys are going, you're not going to finish tomorrow with this witness.  So I'm concerned about it.  So let's go as far as we can go.  At least I'm going to go to 6:30.

MR. FURR:  Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BRENNER:  Thank you, Judge.

THE BAILIFF:  Sir.

THE COURT:  Yes.

THE BAILIFF:  Are we ready?

THE COURT:  Sure.  Go ahead and bring out the jury. (Thereupon, the jurors entered the courtroom.)

THE BAILIFF:  Jury entering.

THE COURT:  All right.  Have a seat.

MR. FURR:  Thank you, Your Honor.

questions about the issue that we've just

discussed.  Let me go ahead and ask some

questions, and then I'll evaluate with them

about how late we're going to be stay tonight.

MR. FURR:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Proceed in the meantime.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, the last question that I asked

before we broke was that your expectation would be

that in preparation for this trial there would have

been depositions taken of individuals that had

firsthand knowledge about Mr. Shulman's smoking

behavior and smoking choices, correct?

A    I would assume.

Q    You, for example, you would assume that his

deposition was taken, correct?

A    I would assume.

Q    And are you aware that Mr. Shulman's wife,

Ethel is still alive and is 92?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  This is

outside the scope.  The question itself calls

for speculation, asking him to assume.  We all

know �

MR. FURR:  I object, Judge.  There

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No.  I don't know anything

about his wife.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    You don't know that she's alive?

A    No.

Q    Do you know that Mr. Shulman has a living

son?

A

No

Q    With respect to your assumption about Mr. Shulman's deposition, wouldn't it also be your expectation that during that deposition that Mr. Shulman was asked questions about the types of topics we've been discussing; that is, what he was told about the danger of smoking, when he received that information and what he did with that information?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object it's

speculative.  The question starts out with "with

respect to your assumption."  That's inherently

speculative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Dr. Proctor, as you told the jury under

Page 4810 questioning from Mr. Gdanski, there was a time when

you testified differently; that is, you would study

the individual, the facts related to an individual

smoker in preparation for your testimony.  Do you

recall that?

A   Yes, a long time ago I was asked to do that.

Q    When you did that, you would review depositions, correct?

A    Occasionally, yeah.  That was like 10 years ago.

Q    When you reviewed those depositions, those depositions would contain information about what the smoker was told about the danger of smoking, when the smoker was provided that information, and what the smoker did with that information, right?

A    I recall things like that.

Q    Would it be your expectation in this case those same types of questions were asked in Mr. Shulman's deposition?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  This has been

asked and answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I really don't know.  It

certainly makes sense.

Q    You did not review Mr. Shulman's

deposition, did you?

A    No.

Q    You did not review the deposition of Mrs. Shulman � if she's alive and gave a deposition, you didn't review it, right ?

A    Correct.

Q    You did not review the deposition testimony of Mr. Shulman's son, Harvey, did you?

A    Correct.

Q    Now, when you used to prepare to testify in individual cases with respect to specific plaintiffs, you also used to review something called interrogatories, correct ?

A    I don't remember ever doing that, but I probably did.

Q    You do know what interrogatories are, don't you?

A    Barely.  Barely.  I know it's part of the fact-gathering process.

Q    You know that interrogatories are served on parties?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  This is

counsel testifying.

It's cross-examination.  I'm allowed to lead,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.

Okay.  I'm going to overrule the objection,

and then based on the discussion that we had

before, I'm going to have you ask one more

question and I'm going to go ahead and let the

jury go and we're going to start again tomorrow

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir, thank you.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, you would have expected that

the interrogatories in this case that contain

information about when Mr. Shulman began smoking, why

he began smoking, when he attempted to quit and

whether he was able to quit, right, all those things?

A    Sounds reasonable.

Q    You didn't review the interrogatories in

this case, did you?

A    Correct.

MR. FURR:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.  Ladies

and gentlemen of the jury, I know that the

deputies communicated with you about staying late, but both sides in this case, both the plaintiff and the defense, were concerned about not taxing the time of the jurors and both sets of lawyers indicated that they did not want to keep the jury late tonight.  So I appreciate their efforts, and we're going to go ahead and have you go home now.  We'll have you come back at 25 minutes after 9:00 tomorrow morning.

Don't communicate about this case.  Don't communicate with each other, with any other third parties or any family members.  Don't do any independent investigation.  Don't go on any social web sites.

Page 4821 mentioned you were going to take a long lunch

today.  What time do you plan on breaking today?

THE COURT:  Well, I was going to tell the jury today that it wasn't the lawyers' fault, that it was my fault because of my lunch, that I was � because the deputy has a pretty good communication with the jurors about scheduling.

And, you know, on certain days, if they don't have something that's pressing, the jurors seem to be okay about � this jury seems to be okay about staying late every once in a while, as needed.

So I'm prepared to stay late tonight and tell them it's my fault, not your fault, like last time.  I didn't want to blame it on you guys last time, and I know the way that came up, so I decided to release them yesterday based on that.

My feeling is that I'd like to � I need to take � because of my own schedule, I need to take a longer lunch break today from like 11:45 till probably about 1:45.

I'm probably going to tell the jury to come back at 1:45 and we might not even get started until 2.

So I was going to try to go as late as

Page 4822 we can go tonight because I know tomorrow,

Mr. Gdanski celebrates Sabbath.  So we can't go

late tomorrow, right?

MR. HAMMER:  Well, that's correct, yeah.

MR. GDANSKI:  It is correct that I try � I mean I do celebrate the Sabbath, but if we have a video playing, I would just as soon cut out, because the time change makes the Sabbath dramatically earlier, and if we have a video playing �

THE COURT:  Well, that's fine with me. However you want to do that, that's fine.  But I just thought tonight � tonight, you know, I could keep the jury here later.

You know, I could keep them until 6:30 or 7:00 if we need to, and I can just blame it on me, and I'll tell from the beginning, I'll tell them this morning.

MR. HAMMER:  No matter how you tell them, I would prefer you never blame it on the lawyers.

THE COURT:  Well, I never was, but I wanted to make sure that they knew it was the judge and not the lawyers, because last time � because I didn't tell them early enough.

I had no reason to � you know, I had no other way

to blame it on anything.  So I'm going to just

blame it on my personal schedule today.

You guys okay with that?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let's do it.

THE COURT:  We keep a lot of stuff in that jury room.  We keep � that the Court doesn't pay for, that Deputy Fox and I provide over there. We provide some soups, snacks.  There's all kinds of things in there.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's very nice.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.

All right.  Everybody good to go?  Have a seat.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you.  I'm sorry about the confusion last night. You know, it � and I appreciate the � I know Deputy Fox has already spoken to you, and I appreciate the willingness of the jury to stay

Unfortunately today, because of scheduling matters, I have to take a longer lunch break.

I have to take � and it has nothing to do with these lawyers.  It has to do with other scheduling matters that I have.

So I have to take a break from like 11:45 till 1:45, maybe 2:00.

So because of that, I'm going to ask that you guys are prepared to stay late tonight, as I think Deputy Fox may have told you.

It has nothing to do with the lawyers. Don't blame it on the lawyers.  It's my schedule. It's because of that long lunch break that we have to do that.

So � but I really appreciate the willingness of you guys to do that and your service, and I'm very appreciative.

Ready to proceed?

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

BY MR. FURR:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Proctor.

A.  Good morning.

Q.  Ready to start?

A.  I am.

Q.  Yesterday when we finished off, we were talking about things that you could have done to learn specific facts about Mr. Shulman's case. Do you recall that?

A.  I do.

Q.  And we just spoke about interrogatories. You did not review any of Mr. Shulman's medical records in preparation for your testimony; is that correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Is it also correct that notwithstanding the fact that obviously Mr. Shulman is alive, that you did not interview or discuss with Mr. Shulman his case, right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And as we informed you yesterday, Mrs. Shulman is alive.  You didn't know that, so of course, you also haven't discussed the case with Mrs. Shulman, correct?

A.  Correct.

Page 4826 Q.  And you know Mr. Shulman has a son named

Harvey, who is still alive, don't you?

A.  No, I did not know that.

Q.  Obviously, you did not interview Harvey about what Mr. Shulman knew about the danger of smoking, when he knew it, and what he did with that information, or anything like that, right? A.  Yes, you're correct.  That's obvious. Q.  All right.  I want to turn now to a topic that you and Mr. Gdanski talked about at great length, and that is over the course of five days, you spoke at length about the way in which you testified that the tobacco companies concealed information about the dangers of smoking from the public, right? A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI: Judge, I'm going to object to the characterization. It's a finding that it's concealed information.

MR. FURR:  I'm talking about his testimony, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's right.  Concealed, distorted, distracted from, denied, you know, a

denying and refuting it.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And you talked about � you gave your opinions about the impact that that concealment had on the public and their smoking behavior, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  All right.  What I want to talk with you at some length today on a couple different occasions about information that was available to the public about the dangers and addictive properties of smoking.  Okay?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Now, I want to be fair because you were very forthcoming in your direct examination.  You testified that there have been thousands and thousands of stories about the dangers of smoking in the popular press, correct?

A.  Of course.

Q.  I'm going to talk with you about those at some length later today, but I just want to talk about it sort of top line right now.

You told the jury that when there was new scientific proof discovered by scientists,

or some other disease, that there would be

widespread � widespread publicity about that

finding in the popular press, right?

A.  That's correct, especially after the � well, the beginning of the 1950s.

Q.  Yes, sir.

A.  That's when you really get the � the flood of new scientific information.

Q.  And you told the jury that that information about the danger of smoking would occur in a variety of different types of media, correct?

A.  That's right, television, radio, newspapers, you know, many different forms.  It was big.  Big story.

Q.  Magazines also?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So what I want to do is I want to talk about how the public reacted to that information.  Okay?  And in particular, I want to talk with you about the quitting smoking that occurred as a result of that information being publicized.  All right?

A.  Yes.

direct examination that in the 1950, '51, '52 time

frame, that there was really an outpouring of new

scientific information about smoking causing lung

cancer, right?

A.  Right.  That's when you get the establishment of the consensus based on those four separate lines of evidence.

Q.  And you described � you testified to the jury that the information that came out in the early 1950s was very powerful evidence about the dangers of smoking, right?

A.  It was.  That's why you get this first big wave of guitting.

Q.  And that's what we're going to talk about, because among the things that happened is you said that there were billions of fewer cigarettes smoked in the United States as a result of that new information?

A.  That's right.  That's that significant downtick in consumption in 1953 that prompts the conspiracy.

Q.  And you told the jury that the � the publicity surrounding those first � those studies in the early 1950s made a large portion of the

quitting in this country, right?

A.  Well, certainly a significant portion. That's when you do see the first wave of quitting, especially people like physicians.  You know, of course, people are also starting during this period, but, you're correct, it's the first big wave of quitting.

Q.  And that scared millions of people into quitting in the early 1950s, right? A.  It did.

Q.  Notwithstanding my poor handwriting that you're well familiar with, I'm going to try to capture how quitting occurred in this country and when they began quitting.

Can you see that, Dr. Proctor? A.  I can, thank you.

MR. FURR:  Can you see that, ladies and gentlemen?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, do you mind if I move so I can see what's being written?

MR. FURR:  I have no objection. THE COURT:  Yes, no problem.  You can move around.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  All right.  Dr. Proctor, I've written "quitting," and by that, of course, I mean quitting smoking.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So in the early 1950s, there were � as you just told us a couple times again, I appreciate you being so forthcoming, there were millions of smokers who quit during those years, right ?

A.  Yes.  It's mainly the mid '50s is when it really gets going.

Q.  And you would agree, sir, that this quitting was driven by people's fears and concerns about the dangers of smoking, right?

A.  Exactly.  This is when you see the first self-help books on, you know, how to quit, that sold, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies.

Q.  Hundreds of thousands of copies were sold?

A.  Eventually millions.

Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

Page 4832 which people in the United States quit smoking

over the course of time from the 1950s forward,

aren't you?

A.  I am.  It's about 60 million people quit over about 60 years from 1950 to 2010.  So it's about 1 million per year, on average, though the bulk of those occur after the 1964 Surgeon General's report, when we get the highest rate of quitting we've ever had in this country.

Q.  Okay.  I'm going to break that down. Thank you.  I appreciate that.

I'11 go ahead and write the end of the chart first since you've given us that.  You said by 2010 �

A.  Yeah.

Q.  � about 60 million?

A.  That's right.  It's over a 60-year period.  It's about 1 million per year, on average, the bulk of those being after the 1964 Surgeon General's report when 2 to 3 million people were quitting every year.  Of course, a lot of people are starting during that entire period.

Q.  Thank you, sir.

So we will break all this down in a

the jury about when quitting occurred and what

events it was tied to.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go to 1965, because that's the year after the first Surgeon General's report was published, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So by 1965, sir, wouldn't you agree that about 17 million Americans had quit smoking?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And although this was the year after the Surgeon General's report, of course, they didn't all quit between '64 and '65.  This was the total of people that had quit since the 1950s, right?

A.  That's right.  They really began quitting in large numbers in the '50s after this new scientific information comes out, and it's publicized.

Q.  Thank you, sir.

By 1965, you recognize that Mr. Shulman would have been about 45 years old, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  I want to focus specifically on this 1960 to 1965 time frame.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because the quitting that began in the 1950s accelerated during this period of time; isn't that correct, sir?

A.  Yes, and especially after '64.

Q.  Okay.  We're going to get there, but wouldn't you agree that within this time frame, about 9 million Americans quit smoking in that five-year period?

A.  That sounds about right.

Q.  And if we just roughly do the math and divide that number by the number of days in those years, that would have been about 5,000 Americans quitting per day, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  Now, after that period of time, though, quitting accelerated between 1966 and 1970, didn't it?

A.  That's right.  It's � actually, the highest rate of quitting occurs after the 1964 Surgeon General's report and its publicity.

Q.  Okay.  So after the Surgeon General's report and its related publicity, which we'll look at some of that today, including some of the programs that you and Mr. Gdansk! played for the

Page 4835 jury, and after the first caution label went on

the packages, in this time frame, about 13 million

Americans quit smoking; is that correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And, again, just doing the math, dividing that number by the number of days contained within that time frame, that would have been about 8,000 � 8,000 Americans quitting per day, on average, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And, of course, by 1970, Mr. Shulman would have been about 50 years old, right?

A.  That sounds right.

Q.  Now, I do want to mention, before we go on with this timeline, I want to mention a document that you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed yesterday, the 1967 FTC report. Do you recall that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And one of the things you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed was the finding in the FTC report that the FTC found that the caution label was not effective.

Do you recall that?

A.  That's true.

Page 4836 Q.  So let's � let's talk a little bit

about how that FTC finding occurred and what it

was based on.

First of all, it came out in 1967.  That

was only one year after the caution was placed on

the package; is that correct?

A.  That's right, just a little over a year.

Q.  So, in fairness, the warning had not had � the caution had not had a lot of time to take effect, had it?

A.  That's true.  Yeah, they're mainly basing it on the fact that the number of cigarettes being smoked was still increasing.

Q.  What the FTC did, in fact, was they did some surveys of doctors and other medical professionals asking their opinion about whether the warning was effective, correct?

A.  That's right, and some of those, to be fair, had been done actually before the label was even put on the package.

Q.  Right.  What the FTC did not do at that time was collect the type of data that we're talking about with respect to the number of quitters, right?

Page 4837 A.  That's right.  They were mainly looking

more at the fact that the actual epidemic was

still on the increase, the number of cigarettes

being smoked per year was still increasing.

Q.  As the population was growing, right?

A.  Well, yes, population growing and the total number of cigarettes being smoked, and not just population growing, but also new people quitting because, of course, at the same time people were quitting, millions of people were starting �

Q.  What the FTC �

A.  � starting to smoke.

Q.  Thank you, sir.

What the FTC did not do was survey actual smokers with respect to whether they were quitting or not, right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Of course, it's obvious from the data you've given us, the quitting did not stop in 1970, did it?

A.  No, it continued, as it continues today. It's even accelerated.

Q.  Okay.  I want to talk with you about the � the decade following the release of the

A.  Yes.

Q.  So 1964 to 1974?

A.  Right.

Q.  In that decade, in the ten-year decade following the Surgeon General's report � and actually, this includes the decade in which the second warning label went on the packages, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Wouldn't you agree, sir, that it's been estimated that about 30 million Americans quit smoking in this 10-year time span?

A.  That's correct.  It's a very high rate of quitting.  It also includes not just � you mentioned the warning on the packaging.  There's also a warning on the print advertising that starts in the early 1970s.

Q.  Right.  In the early 1970s, companies were actually required not only to put the warning on the packaging but also in all the print advertising, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So, for example, a smoker like Mr. Shulman, during this decade, every time he picked up a package of cigarettes after 1966, he

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And also, every time he saw an advertisement after 1971, that warning was available for him to see, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  I want to be clear, sir.  This � this time period, 1964 to 1974, when we had 30 million Americans quit smoking, that was a time period when the tobacco companies were vigorously disputing that smoking had been proven to be dangerous and addictive, right?

A.  That's exactly right, and a very high rate of starting as well.  That needs to be kept in �

Q.  Now let's go to 1975, and we'll sort of add up these numbers in the total for 1975 because, in all fairness, some of these numbers are from overlapping time periods, right?

Q.  So you can't just add up the numbers?

A.  No, you have to � that's why the 1 million per year is a convenient summary.

Q.  Well, I want to talk about the quitting by 1975, because that may be a date that has significance in this case.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  By 1975, wouldn't you agree that there had been about 45 million Americans quit smoking?

A.  That sounds about right.

Page 4841 quitting that we have been discussing was driven

primarily by people's fears about the dangers of

smoking, right?

A.  Well, that's exactly right.  People had no idea that cigarettes could kill them.  All this news comes out in the '60s, '70s, and people start quitting in very large numbers, and it's just as you say, fearing for their lives.

Q.  Okay.  And based upon your view of the historical records, you know that in this time frame, from the early 1950s to 1975, that 95 percent of the people who quit smoking in this time frame quit cold turkey, right?

A.  Yes, there were very few examples of what we call nicotine replacement therapy, you know, things like that.  So they really had no other technique.

Q.  All right.  We will come back to this chart as we go forward when we discuss about other events that happened.  Okay?

that were of Mr. Shulman's age.

Do you recall that?

Q.  Sir, one of the ways that smoking behaviors have been studied in this country is to study what are referred to as birth cohorts, right ?

A.  Yes, meaning people born, say, between 1920, '25, that's one cohort.  People born between 1925 and 1930, that's another cohort.  Because each cohort has different peak levels of smoking, different peak rates of quitting and so forth.

Q.  Okay.  And I appreciate that answer, because the 1920 to 1925 birth cohort of men, in other words, men born during those years, that would, in fact, be the cohort that Mr. Shulman would have fit in, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Sir, with respect to Mr. Shulman's birth cohort, isn't it true that quitting among that group of men in this country accelerated in the 1950s?

A.  Yeah, I think that's � that's true, I think, for almost every cohort who � well, I guess if you weren't born then, that couldn't be, but that's true for his cohort, that's correct.

Q.  And then quitting among Mr. Shulman's age, like for lots of other people, accelerated even further in the 1960s, right?

A.  That's correct.  People in that cohort had a very high rate of smoking.  It's one of the highest of all times.

Q.  And they began quitting in the 1950s and '60s, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  In fact, the greatest downturn in the � well, let's define a term.

Would you define "prevalence of smoking" for the jury?

A.  That's the rate at which a population smokes.  Like, for example, you could talk about youth smoking prevalence.

Page 4844 That would mean the fraction of youth,

however you defined it, who are smoking.  It might

be 15 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent.

It has nothing to do with the number of

cigarettes smoked.  It's the percentage of the

people in that group who are smoking.

Q.  Okay.  I'll use the term "fraction of men smoking Mr. Shulman's age."  Okay?

A.  That's another way to say it.

Q.  So the fraction of men of Mr. Shulman's age that were smoking declined the most rapidly than it ever did in the 1960s; isn't that correct?

A.  That's correct.  It reached one of the highest levels of all cohorts and it also had, as you say, a high rate of quitting.

Q.  It had a steep rate of decline after the 1950s, didn't it?

A.  Yes, it did.

Q.  In fact, in the 1960s alone, about 30 percent of the men that were in Mr. Shulman's birth cohort quit smoking, right?

A.  Something like that.  I don't have the exact figures on the tip of my tongue, but I wouldn't dispute that.

were quitting.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  Because based upon your review of the historical record, you are familiar with information about the number of cigarettes being smoked per day by people who quit at different times, right?

A.  Somewhat.  I don't have a lot of detailed knowledge of that.

Q. Okay. Well, we'll � I can refresh your recollection if we � if I ask you a question you don't remember.  Okay?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Sir, wouldn't you agree that in the � in this time frame, the late 1960s on to the 1980s, that a substantial portion of the individuals who quit were, in fact, heavy smokers?

A.  Oh, that's for sure, because a lot of people were heavy smokers, and so, obviously, a lot of them who quit would have been heavy smokers, too.

Q. In fact, somewhere at least in the range of half of the people who quit in this time frame

A.  That sounds about right.  The notion of heavy smokers changes a little bit over time. Sometimes heavy smokers was two or more packs a day.  Now we would tend to regard even one pack a day as heavy smoking.

Q.  And over half of the people who were quitting during these decades we've outlined were certainly people who smoked more than a pack per day?

A.  That sounds right, yeah.

Q.  Well, wouldn't you agree that between the end of the World War II and the 1980s, that the U.S. population underwent a rapid growth?

A.  Oh, I see what you mean.  Yes, that's true.

Q.  And, of course, we had, during those years, the number of adults in this country rapidly increased, correct?

Do you agree?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And today � of course, today, the U.S. population is about 320 million, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Now would you tell the jury what "per capita consumption of cigarettes" means?

A.  "Capita" means head, and "per capita" means per head or per person.  It's an indicator.

So when you want to look at the rate of � you want to compare, say, the smoking rate in Iceland and the United States, you do a per capita measure because, obviously, the population in Iceland is much smaller.

And so the way to get one measure of intensity of smoking is the per capita rate.

Q.  But the per capita consumption in the United States, as you explained to the jury, actually peaked in about 1963, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Let him finish.

THE WITNESS:  That's an important distinction.

The per capita total consumption, including children, doesn't peak until 1977.  The per capita adult consumption peaks in 1963.

As you say, it's important to distinguish those two because the per capita total consumption peaks later because more and more kids are starting to smoke as a result of the liberalism of the 1960s and the increased targeting of youth by the industry.

So it's important to realize there are two different groups you can take, either just adults, which peaks in 1963, or adults and children, which peaks in 1977.

The adult peak of '63 is 4,400 cigarettes per adult.  The 1977 peak is something like 3,000 cigarettes per person, per capita, including the children.

Q.   (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.

A.  It's lower because, of course, children smoke less than adults.

Q.  Well, let's try to capture both of those notions.

Page 4851 This was the peak of the per capita

adult, 1963, right?

A.  That's correct, at 4,400 cigarettes per adult, smokers and nonsmokers alike.

Q.  And then you said 1977, the total per capita �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � peaked, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  Both of those numbers, of course, are � those peaked earlier than the total cigarette consumption in the United States, right?

A.  They do, as you said, because of the increase in population.

Q.  Now the 1963 peak of per capita consumption of cigarettes, it peaked the year before the 1964 Surgeon General's report, correct?

A.  Yeah, but you didn't say it right.  You said per capita consumption.

Q.  I meant to say "adult."

A.  I know, but that's a crucial distinction.  You left off "adult."

A.  Correct.

Q.  And it has been going downward ever

since, right?

A.  Yes, with some little fluctuation. Q.  With some fluctuations, but the general trend has been going down?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And today, the adult per capita consumption is around 1100 cigarettes?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object to questions about smoking rates today.

MR. FURR:  Well, I'm happy to approach, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think we need to approach.

THE COURT:  All right.  Approach.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, the only reason I did this is because, on direct examination, Mr. Gdanski asked a question that prompted the witness to talk about the total number of cigarettes sold per day.  That was what they talked about.

about today, then they'll do that at their

MR. FURR:  No.

for redirect

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, he asked about today.  He can't ask about today and preclude me from examining about today and then suggest that somehow by responding to what he did, I've opened the door to something.

MR. GDANSKI:  They objected �

MR. FURR:  It doesn't work that way.

MR. GDANSKI:  Sorry.

They objected to every question about today on the record.  If Dr. Proctor gave an answer that they thought was improper, they should have asked to approach, objected, and moved to strike it.  They didn't.

I have no real principle problem with the question so long as � if, you know, Your Honor can overrule the objection, and Mr. Furr is asking, at his own peril, for redirect.  That's all.  It can't work differently against the plaintiff.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded

and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Proctor, we were

seeing that today the adult per capita consumption

is about 1100 cigarettes, right?

A.  I think that's about right, yeah.

Q.  So doing the math, simply since � since

1963, there has been about a 75 percent decrease

in the adult per capita consumption, correct?

A.  That's right, so just to be clear what

that means, that's 1100 cigarettes smoked for

every adult in the United States, not just

smokers, every year.

Q.  And that's about 75 �

Page 4855 A.  Take all the cigarettes � take all the

cigarettes smoked divided by the number of adults,

and you'll get the 1100 figure per year.

Q.  Which is about a 75 percent decrease

since 1963, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  In fact, the 1964 Surgeon General's report was really � resulted in the turning of prevalence rates of smoking in this country, correct?

A.  Well, prevalence is a little bit different, right?  We're talking about per capita rate.  Prevalence is the fraction of the people smoking.

See, actually, the youth prevalence doesn't smoke until 1997. So prevalence is a little bit different story.

But you're right, I think, in the general point that 1964 represents a turning point really in the cigarette epidemic.

Q.  Of adult smoking rates and cigarettes?

A.  Well, every � every aspect, not just adults.  Remember, the children, again, peak later.  1997 is the peak year for youth smoking in the United States, but if you take sort of the

	Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  In the early 1950s in

11
	this country, about 50 percent of adults were

12
	smoking; is that correct?

13
	A.  Nearly that, and, of course, it's higher

14
	than that for men; it's significantly lower than

15
	that for women.

16
	Q.  Roughly 50 percent total, right?

17
	A.  Nearly 50 percent.

18
	Q.  And today, we are down to about 15

19
	percent of adults in the United States smoking

20
	cigarettes, correct?

21
	A.  Correct.

22
	Q.  And the rate of decline in adults

23
	smoking cigarettes in this country has continued

24
	to accelerate, hasn't it?

25
	A.  Well, it's continued.  I'm not sure if

Q.  Between just last year and this year,

about � be 2 percent less of adults in the United

States were smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object to it.

It's outside the scope.  Current statistic.

MR. FURR:  Same issue, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Two percent fewer, that's

correct.

Q.   (BY MR. FURR)  Right.

And that 2 percent equates into millions

of fewer smokers, adult smokers, this year than

last year, right?

A.  That's right.  Another way to say that

is millions of people are stopping smoking every

year.

Q.  And, sir, this decline in smoking

prevalence that we've been talking about �

A.  Well, let me just qualify that last

answer.

It would probably not be millions, but

hundreds of thousands, because there are only

millions quitting every year.  So it would be, you

know, nearly a million, hundreds of thousands.

Q.  Hundreds of thousands?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  And, sir, you � this decline in smoking prevalence is evidence of the continued denormalization of smoking in our society, correct?

A.  Right.  That's really the principal reason for the decline.  It's become less cool, less fashionable, less attractive to smoke.  There are many bans on advertising that now exist. There are fewer ways for the industry to get out its message.

Q.  And, sir, in your opinion, cigarette smoking is really a horse and buggy technology that is on decline and that you anticipate will continue to decline, right?

A.  I do.  I anticipate the extinction of the cigarette.  It's not even liked by smokers, so it's not even a recreational drug.

Q.  So your anticipation is that eventually the United States will have no cigarette smoking?

speculative and improper question.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  I want to talk to you about a slightly different topic, Dr. Proctor, and that is I want to turn to discuss advertising a bit because you and Mr. Gdanski showed the jury a large number of advertisements made by these defendants over time, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You showed the jury advertisements using sports figures, for example, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  You showed the jury advertisements using celebrities, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now during the time that sports figures and celebrities were used in cigarette ads, it was legal to do so, wasn't it?

A.  I believe so.  I don't know of a law that it was violating.

Q.  You also showed the jury some television clips where R.J. Reynolds was advertising on The Flintstones and The Beverly Hillbillies. Do you recall that?

A.  I think it was.

Q.  You � again, you were very forthcoming about the Winston advertising on Flintstones, but I just want to talk about a few additional facts. Okay?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Winston sponsored The Flintstones for only a single season, correct?

A.  That's correct, in 1960.

Q.  The Fall of 1960, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that was actually the very first year that The Flintstones appeared on television, right?

A.  It did � it was.

Q. When The Flintstones � as you told the jury, when The Flintstones came out, the program was advertised as an adult cartoon, right?

A. Yes, actually, I think it was the first adult cartoon.

	right?

Right.  It says that he smoked Lucky Strike, Old Gold, Chesterfield, and English Ovals, and Marlboro.

Q.  Thank you, sir.

So you were not told that he ever smoked Winston, right?

A.  Again, I said I didn't remember one way or the other.

Q.  While we have that smoking history fresh on our minds that you were provided, you and Mr. Gdanski talked a lot on direct examination about filtered cigarettes, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And, sir, are you aware that the Lucky Strike cigarettes that Mr. Shulman smoked were unfiltered cigarettes?

A.  I think that's correct.  That whole early period, they didn't have so-called filters.

Q.  Based on the smoking history that you were provided by Mr. Gdanski, would you agree that

manufactured by R.J. Reynolds?

A.  That sounds right, yeah.

Q.  Based on that same smoking �

A.  Now, of course, that � yeah, I think that sounds right.

Q.  Based on that same smoking history, would you agree that Mr. Shulman never smoked a filtered cigarette manufactured by the American Tobacco Company?

A.  Presumably.  Again, that's not my expertise.  I don't really know anything about that, but I wouldn't dispute it.

Q.  The list of cigarettes that you were provided by Mr. Gdanski does not include a filtered cigarette manufactured by R.J. Reynolds, does it?

Q.  And the list of cigarettes that you were provided by Mr. Gdanski does not include a cigarette manufactured by Brown & Williamson, does it?

A.  Correct.

Q.  You and Mr. Gdanski spoke at length over the past five days of testimony � it actually spanned a little bit longer than that with our weekend � about the agreements between the companies that you labeled a conspiracy, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Sir, you would agree that your testimony is that the agreement between the companies was for limited purposes, right?

A.  Yes, it was not an "everything" conspiracy.  It was targeted principally at denial of health harms.

Q.  Sir, you've seen no evidence demonstrating that the cigarette companies entered into any type of agreement to market filtered cigarettes as a health reassurance product, have you?

A.  That's correct.  That's correct.  Yeah,

Page 4866 I mean, I do think that there are certain themes

that were excluded as a result of the conspiracy

having to do with filters, but, you're correct,

they separately were developing filters in order

to acquire the highest market share on behalf of

each company.

Q.  Of course, the companies were competing

in the market with their filtered cigarettes,

right ?

A.  That's right.  Yeah.  So the conspiracy

is more about, again, health denial, though, of

course, the conspiracy allowed them to continue

marketing because probably they would have gone

Q.  Let's just be clear.  You've seen no

evidence that the companies entered into an

agreement to market filtered cigarettes as a

health reassurance product, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Asked and answered.

THE WITNESS:  Well �

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  � I would have to give the same answer, namely, they each separately were trying to get as much of the filter market as they

But there were certain common themes

about what they were willing to admit or not admit that were governed by the Committee of Council, the supreme authority of the conspiracy.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, you recognize, don't you, that the defendants in this case, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, and Liggett, are separate companies, don't you?

A.  They are separate insofar as they are marketing �

Q.  No, they're separate entities?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object to cutting the witness off.

MR. FURR:  He's becoming nonresponsive, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not up to Mr. Furr. I object.  I'd like the witness to be able to finish the answer, please.

MR. FURR:  I'd like to re-ask the question, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  He's in the middle of answering.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ask your next question.

MR. FURR:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, you agree that R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, and Liggett are separate corporate entities, correct?

A.  Yes, they are separate corporate entities.

Q.  And they have always been separate corporate entities, haven't they?

A.  Well, that's not entirely true.  The Sherman Antitrust Act broke up the tobacco monopoly in 1911.

And out of that came several of our modern cigarette companies, so � but if we exclude that, then it's � it's closer to the truth.

Q.  Okay.  Thank you.

I want to look a little closer at the testimony that you gave about what the tobacco companies thought about filtered cigarettes. Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  On your direct examination, you indicated that the tobacco companies knew from the beginning that filtered cigarettes would be ineffective, correct?

Obviously, any given company may have tens of

thousands of employees, and so any given person in

that may have a different view, but there are

expressions from the beginning, from early on,

about the inefficacy or the � that filters are

purely a sales and marketing proposition.

It obviously doesn't refer to every

person in these companies.

Q.  Well, I want to zero in on R.J. Reynolds.

You reviewed a lot of company documents, haven't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You reviewed a lot of R.J. Reynolds documents, haven't you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you cannot identify any R.J. Reynolds documents from the 1960s or '70 or '80s where R.J. Reynolds' scientists are stating that they believe that smokers of filtered cigarettes will get as much tar and nicotine as smokers of non-filtered cigarettes, can you?

A.  Yeah, I can't think of a document exactly fitting that category.

Q.  Now on the other hand, although you haven't seen those documents, during your review of R.J. Reynolds' documents from the 1970s, the 1980s, and even up until the 1990s, you have seen statements in those documents where R.J. Reynolds' scientists were stating, genuinely stating that they genuinely � genuinely believed that filtered cigarettes would be better for health than non-filtered cigarettes, haven't you?

A.  Occasionally.  Occasionally you see that.  I can't think of an example, but there are so many documents that it would not be surprising to find that.

recall them.

Q.  Okay.  We spoke about this briefly when we were looking at these statistics regarding smokers quitting.

I do now want to turn with you to looking at, in a little more detail, the information that has been available to smokers about the dangers of smoking over time.  Okay?

A.  Sure.

Q.  We sort of � I sort of want to do � given that we have a historian with us today, I want to do a condensed history of the information about the dangers of smoking that have been available to the public.

That's something you're familiar with, right ?

A.  Yes, the � yeah.

Q.  I want to start with a brief review of the sources of information, that is, the entities, the organizations, the types of bodies that were putting information about the dangers of smoking in the public domain, including the popular press. Okay?

A.  Sure.

smoking and the addictive properties of smoking

available to their students for a long time,

correct?

A.  Occasionally, yes.  It's important to realize when you say "information," there very often could be misinformation as well.  Early textbooks are full of misinformation and information.

Q.  Well, we'll get to this later, but wouldn't you agree that a hundred years ago, a common theme contained in school textbooks, when discussing cigarette smoking, was that cigarette smoking could shorten your life?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object, Judge.  Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Yep.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, it doesn't matter.

I object to questions about what was in school textbooks 100 years ago.

THE COURT:  Say that again.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object � I object to questions about what was in school textbooks 100 or 80 or 90 years ago.

Mr. Shulman obviously was not in school, and they can't put any of these textbooks in his hands specifically as to the ones that he had.

And more fundamentally, when I wanted to talk about the tobacco companies marketing to youth and going on to youth campuses or college campuses or prep schools in around that same time, the 192- � 1918, 1928 period of time, Your Honor would not let me do that.  Your Honor sustained their objections.

I tried to introduce this document and a companion document into evidence and show it with Dr. Proctor.

This is from 1927.  Your Honor said: No, youth has nothing to do with what's going on back then.

And so how could they ask about school

to.

MR. FURR:  May I proceed, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Okay.  Dr. Proctor, you

touched on this, but I want to be clear sort of

the basis where we started.

The mass media has played a large role

in publicizing the dangers of smoking and the

addictive properties of smoking since the 1950s,

correct?

A.  Yes, publicizing the dangers, but also

denying the dangers.

Q.  Okay.  Right now, I'm asking you about

publicizing the dangers.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Try to track my question.

You would agree, sir, that, as you told

us, there have been thousands and thousands of

articles published in newspapers about the dangers

A.  Yes.

Q.  And in magazines, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I �

A.  When you say "the dangers," it's a bit ambiguous because the type of dangers increases over time.  In other words, there's new discoveries of new dangers, so with that qualification, yes.

Q.  Sure.  They can't discuss things that haven't been discovered yet, right?

A.  Right.  It's like lung cancer was not well understood before the '50s.  Other things, like smoking being the leading cause of amputations, was better understood.

Q.  One of the magazines that we'll talk about today at some length was the Reader's Digest.

The Reader's Digest, in fact, was an important source of information about the dangers of smoking, wasn't it?

A.  Yes, and occasionally misinformation.

A.  Yes.  It did not take cigarette advertising, and so it had a type of independence that most magazines did not have.

Q.  You and Mr. Gdanski discussed the type of media that the cigarette companies utilized to present their position on smoking, right?

A.  Some of them, yeah.

Q.  Newspapers, radio, television, things like that?

A.  Sports advertising, sports sponsorships, product placement, lots of things.

Q.  Those same types of media, newspapers, magazines, radio, television, were used by people to present their position about the dangers of smoking, weren't they?

A.  Well, not always.  For example, I don't know of an example where product placement was used to �

I'm not sure that public health agencies ever

sponsored sports the way � you know, we have

Virginia Slims Tennis, NASCAR racing, rodeos

sponsored by many tobacco companies.

I don't think the public health authorities sponsored sports to warn about the harms of smoking.

I don't think they conducted product placement in, you know, movies like Superman and things like that.

So the same types � so that would only be true for certain narrower things, like television and magazines.

It's the exact same question

Again, there's an issue � there's a difference between � between an objection for improper impeachment, and there's a difference between:  I don't think your impeachment is very good.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, I think �

THE COURT:  Your argument that his impeachment is not very good is what you address on redirect.

And you say:  Witness, you know, isn't it true that that was really a different question?

the

trying

position about the dangers of smoking, right?
		

	
	ANSWER:  Correct.


	
	QUESTION:  People were using those same

media,
		those same types of communication to get

out
	information about the dangers of smoking also,
	
right?
		


	
	And your answer was:  Exactly.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  He's allowed to explain the answer.

MR. FURR:  Explain whether I read it correctly or not?

MR. GDANSKI:  He's allowed to explain after he gets impeached by Mr. Furr.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.  The answer has been asked [sic].

Go on to your next question. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, wouldn't you agree that governmental agencies have played a very important role in educating the public about the dangers and addictive properties of smoking? A.  Yes, occasionally.

Q.  Certainly, the federal government began playing a very large role in the 1950s, correct?

A.  Well, in the 1950s, there was � the federal government was still understanding the harms to be from excessive smoking.

So while they begin to publicize about some of the harms, they don't really get a better understanding until the 1960s when they start recognizing that all smoking is harmful, not just excessive smoking.

Page 4883 So while it's true, you have to qualify

it with that recognition that the understanding of

the harm changes at the federal level from the

'50s to the '60s.

Q.  Let's turn back to the exact same page

that we were on.

A.  Okay.

Q.  And look at the next question and

answer.

MR. GDANSKI:  What's the page?  I'm not

there.  1969, I remember that.

MR. FURR:  No, it's 1970, was the end of

it, and that is Lines 11 through 13.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Are you with me,

Dr. Proctor?

A.  I am.

Q.  Sir, isn't it true that during your

deposition you were asked the following question

and gave the following answer:

QUESTION:  Certainly, the federal

government has played a very large role since the

1950s, right?

And your answer was:  That's correct.

Did I read that correct?

Q.  Sir, in addition to the federal

government, state level regulatory agencies, and

other governmental entities at the state level,

have also played a role in publicizing the dangers

and addictive properties of smoking, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object and ask to approach for a moment, Judge.

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. GDANSKI:  It appears to me that they shouldn't be able to ask these questions about what role the federal government or the state regulatory governments play in trying to get out the message that smoking was harmful because I can't, and was not permitted to, talk about how the tobacco companies � and let me back up.

I'm not debating that being historically accurate.  I think it's true.  I just think also after the state governments and the federal government tried to get out the message that smoking was dangerous, the tobacco companies

Page 4885 responded by developing relationships with the

legislature, developing relationship with

congressmen, manipulating the legislation,

lobbying congressmen to effectuate change.

It's precisely because the federal government and the state governments were doing what Mr. Furr is saying they did, that the tobacco companies responded by doing what they did.

So they can't have it both ways.  They can't, on my direct, block me from talking about how the industry, after it became known that smoking was harmful, how the industry, after it became known that smoking was harmful, blocked or tried to effectuate or prevent change at the regulatory legislative governmental level.

THE COURT:  Right now, it only appears as to whether they played a role in publicizing the dangers.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, it's �

THE COURT:  I think it was covered � sort of covered in your direct, wasn't it?

MR. FURR:  It was.  He put on evidence about what the Surgeon General told the public in the 1964 report.

They put out evidence about what the

THE COURT:  How does this have anything to do with the � with lobbying?  He's not asking him about lobbying.  He's just saying:  Didn't the government put these things out?

public.

After that was done, the tobacco companies didn't like that, so they infiltrated and effectuated and prevented change from regulatory agencies.

I wasn't permitted to tell the second part of the story.  I wasn't permitted multiple times to explain:  Okay.  Yeah, the government did say this.  So what did the companies do?

Well, they started to make friends with lobbyists.  They started to make friends with congressmen.

They stopped that.  They prevented it. They effectuated change.  They prevented change.

How could I not talk about the industry's response to the government �

THE COURT:  Are you going to make an argument that you're opening the door to that?

MR. GDANSKI:  Of course he is.  He already has.

MR. FURR:  What we're �

MR. GDANSKI:  I think he already has.  I think he already has opened the door.

MR. FURR:  I'm addressing the Court now.

Your Honor, merely because the statements made by agencies influenced the public's perception of smoking does not open the door to an unlawful cross-examination violating the company's First Amendment rights.  Those aren't linked.  They're simply not linked.

The Court has given Mr. Gdanski an opportunity to make any showing that if he can show to you a specific statement that is made to a specific federal � the specific political body that resulted in a specific misstatement, then he can do that.

You gave him that chance.  He did not take it up because he can't do it.  He doesn't have that type of witness.

But for � without � but for the regulatory agencies and federal agencies and state agencies trying to get the word out that smoking was dangerous and addictive, the tobacco companies never would have tried to effectuate change at that level.  That's the point.

THE COURT:  Sure. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Proctor, in addition to the federal government, state level regulatory agencies and other governmental entities at the state level played a role in publicizing the dangers and addictive properties of smoking; isn't that right?

A.  That's correct, with the caveat, of course, different states pursued this with a different level of strength and efforts. Q.  Yes, sir.

And, of course, here in the United States, we also have specialty public health associations, don't we?

A.  Yes, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, things like that.

Q.  And those specialty organizations that we have in the United States also became involved in the process of educating the public about the dangers of smoking, correct?

A.  That's right.  They were some of the most vigorous.

Q.  They were vigorous, and you believe they played an important role in educating the public about the dangers and addictive properties of smoking, right?

A.  Yes, more important than the states.

Q.  Now, Dr. Proctor, I want to talk to you about a phrase that you explained to the jury when talking about a document written by Dr. Teague, and that phrase was "sine qua non," right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  In the context of that document, what that phrase really means is that nicotine is really important to smoking, right?

A.  Right, it's Latin for "that without which, there is none," meaning, basically, the essential ingredient.

was expressed in the lay media long before

Dr. Teague wrote that document?

A.  That's true.

Q.  Sir, do you recall on direct examination you and Mr. Gdanski talked about a Reader's Digest article from 1924?

A.  Yes, "How Harmful is Smoking?"

Q.  And that, you told the jury, was a Reader's Digest article in which the Reader's Digest posed the question to the public was of whether smoking is bad for your health, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the answer that Reader's Digest gave the public was yes; isn't that correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And, in fact, as you and Mr. Gdanski discussed, the Reader's Digest has been reporting extensively about the dangers of smoking for a long time, right?

A.  That's right.  There were over 30 articles in the Reader's Digest from 1924 into the 1960s, most of which are quite critical of tobacco.

was a magazine that had a hardback cover, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It was a magazine that was more resilient than other types of magazines?  It would sort of hang around, right?

A.  Yeah, it could be passed around.  You would find it in dentists' offices, doctors' offices, waiting rooms, and people would read it and thumb through it, and they'd become worn through reuse.

Q.  In fact, sir, if you were to single out any public forum that in those early years that you just described did more than anyone else to alert the public about the dangers of smoking, the Reader's Digest would be one of those entities, right ?

A.  That's right.  Yeah.  So if you were to name one article, even it would be Roy Norr's "Cancer by the Carton" of 1952.

That's one of the things responsible for that downtick in consumption about by 20 billion cigarettes per year over '53, '54.

Q.  And as you explained on direct examination with Mr. Gdansk!, the idea being that when you buy a carton of cigarettes, you are buying a carton of cancer risk, correct?

A.  Cancer, yeah.  I don't think they used the word "risk," actual cancer.

Q.  In that article, the author reviewed, in the Reader's Digest, those five early epidemiologic studies linking smoking with an increased incidence of lung cancer in human populations, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And as you described on direct examination, that article was one of the important sources of information that contributed to the millions of people deciding to stop smoking in the early 1950s, right?

A.  It can be.  It depends a lot on whether your family member, or in the family you blamed smoking on that disease.  My granddad died of a heart attack, but no one in my family blamed that. We blamed it on his eating too many eggs, and I only realized later it was actually his heavy smoking.

Q.  Let me ask it this way:  People can learn about the dangers of smoking from their own family members, right?

A.  Of course, yes.

Q.  And, of course, in this case, you've made � you did not review the information with respect to whether Mrs. Shulman, for example, warned Mr. Shulman about the dangers of smoking, did you?

A.  I think I may have even mentioned yesterday that I don't know anything about his � if I ever � I'm not sure if I mentioned that once or twice.

Q.  I think you told me he was 14.

A.  Maybe he was 14.

Q.  But I'm asking you a specific question now.  You did not review any information about

dangers of smoking?

A.  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  This is 15.  I object.

He answered it.

THE WITNESS:  No.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think the jury knows that he doesn't know.

MR. FURR:  Okay.

THE COURT:  Are you withdrawing your objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir. Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And you did not review any information about whether Harvey and Bruce Shulman warned their father about the danger of smoking?

MR. GDANSKI:  At some point I have to object that this has been covered pretty thoroughly, Judge.

MR. FURR:  Not this guestion.

MR. GDANSKI:  The entire concept.

THE COURT:  What is the objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  The objection is asked and answered, repetitive, badgering.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And, likewise, you did not review any of the information with respect to what Mr. Shulman told his sons, Harvey and Bruce, about the dangers of smoking?

A.  You are correct.

Q. Okay. I want to go to the 1950s, and I want to look a little bit closer at the types of information that was being made available to the public in those decades.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q. During those decades, wouldn't you agree that there were literally thousands of scientific articles about the dangers of smoking published?

A.  Yes.  Yeah, they really begin in the '30s and '40s and then accelerate in the '50s, and by the late '60s, there's already many thousands of articles.

Q.  It began in the '30s and '40s, right?

A.  Sure.  I mean, there's some more anecdotally that go back to the 18th Century.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you talked about how long it would take to review those documents, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Similar type question:  If we were to try to show the jury all of the popular press publications about the dangers of smoking, it would take us several lifetimes to do so, wouldn't it?

THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Sure.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Now I want to go to a specific document that you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed with respect to information that came out in the 1950s about the dangers of smoking. This was played.  It was Plaintiff's PT3608, which is in evidence.

It's actually the literature review that Dr. Teague, an employee of R.J. Reynolds, did in 1952.

You're familiar with that, right?

A.  '53.

Q.  '53.  Excuse me.

A.  1953, early in that year, February.

Q.  Okay.  Let's talk about first how Dr. Teague created this document.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because this was a document that you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed that you said demonstrated the notice that the tobacco company had or the information that it had about the dangers of smoking, right?

A.  It's one of them, yes.  It's a review of

Q.  I want to look at this document a little bit closer because, as you know, the document that you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed, you talked about some of the statements contained in that document, right ?

A.  I think so, yes.

Q.  Dr. Teague put a bibliography on his document of the types of information he looked at as support for the statements in his document, right ?

A.  Yes, the published literature, technical medical literature on which he relied.

MR. FURR:  Cliff, could we pull that up, the bibliography to the plaintiff's exhibit in evidence?

And if you'd go to the bibliography at the end?

Okay.  Let's go back to the first page.

Q.  (BY MR.

A.  Yes.

Q.  These were publicly available medical journals, right?

A.  They were.

Q.  In this citation � in this bibliography of 78 references that Dr. Teague reviewed in creating this document, he does not cite any secret internal tobacco company documents, does he?

A.  That's right.

Q.  By the way, sir, nowhere in this document does Dr. Teague state that he has reached the conclusion that, in his opinion, that smoking

A.  He doesn't use those words.  He talks about it being an important etiologic factor and important causal factor.

Q.  I want to talk about the types of information that Dr. Teague looked at that are contained in these 78 references.

One of the types of information that Dr. Teague looked at from the publicly available literature were the human epidemiology studies that we've been talking about, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  A second type of literature that Dr. Teague looked at were the animal or experimental studies, including the mouse skin painting studies, right?

A.  That's right, rabbit ear paintings. There were a number of other experimental studies that had produced tumors using tobacco tar on experimental animals.

Q.  Studies that had been done outside the tobacco companies, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you would agree, sir, that the information that Dr. Teague looked at was, in fact, the type of information that someone should have been looking at in order to evaluate the health effects of smoking, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object. That's speculative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Dr. Proctor, would you agree that with respect to Dr. Teague's review, he looked at the right type of scientific information, didn't he?

A.  It's the right stuff.

Q.  Now you said this, but I want to make sure the jury catches this because we'11 refer to it as we go forward.

Those three lines of evidence, the epidemiology, the animal experimentation, and the chemistry studies are what you have referred to as three of the pillars of information that led to the consensus about the dangers of smoking, right?

consensus that smoking was causing lung cancer,

the fourth one being the clinical pathology that

was developed mostly a little bit later, which

involved things like looking at people who died in

traffic accidents.  You'd look at smokers and

nonsmokers.

And they found that even the people who

died of a traffic accident, if you were smoking,

you already had cellular changes in your body that

were of a cancerous nature, even though cancer had

not yet been expressed.

Q.  All right.  I want to stick with the three pillars that occurred a little bit earlier. Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Wouldn't you agree, sir, that as scientific information was developed in each of those pillars, that it was first presented to the public in scientific publications?

A.  Yes, scientific medical publications.

Q.  And then it would be picked up by the popular media and reported in the lay press, the newspapers, magazines, et cetera, to the rest of us, the nonscientists, right?

Q.  One of the authors that Dr. Teague cites frequently in his literature review was a Dr. Roffo, correct?

A.  Yes, Angel Roffo of Argentina.

Q.  I was going to ask you to tell the jury who he was and what he did.

A.  He was really one of the great unsung heroes of the science who actually did all three of these types of research lines that led to the view of cigarettes causing cancer.

He was in Argentina.  He worked on sunlight causing skin cancer.  He worked on a number of topics published almost exclusively in Spanish, but then also translated into German and sometimes French.

And then sometimes summaries of his work

He's the first to identify benzpyrene,

one of those polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that

had been known from the occupational context to

cause cancer.  He's one of the first to identify

that in cigarette smoke.

And then, unfortunately, he dies fairly

young, in the '40s, and his memory is largely

eclipsed by the subsequent work in America and

England.

Q.  Would you say Dr. Roffo, he was a prolific scientist, wasn't he?

A.  He was.  He was a great scientist.

Q.  And you said he's Argentinian and his work was originally published in Spanish, right?

A.  Spanish, German, and French.

Q.  But it was picked up in the scientific literature and republished in English, wasn't it?

A.  Yes � it was not republished in English, but cited is probably the proper way to say it.

Q.  Okay.  And, in fact, speaking of citing, Dr. Teague actually cited Dr. Roffo's work 14 times in that 1953 document, didn't he?

Page 4911 Q.  That was actually the same year that the

Wynder and Graham mouse skin painting studies were

reported in Life Magazine, correct?

A.  That's correct, about nine months earlier.

Q.  And I believe that magazine was introduced into evidence �

MR. FURR:  Is that correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  Which one, Wynder/Graham?

MR. FURR:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  It was.  This one here? Anyway, it is in evidence, yes.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, I'm looking for the magazine that was introduced into evidence.

THE COURT:  Does the clerk have that?

MR. GDANSKI:  The clerk has it in evidence, yes.  So the clerk has it.

THE COURT:  The clerk has it.

MR. FURR:  May I retrieve it, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.  Come right around here.

MR. FURR:  It's a Life Magazine from 1953.  It looks like that one.

Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.

Page 4912 Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  This was Plaintiff's

Exhibit AC356.

In that Life Magazine, Dr. Proctor,

there was an article published titled "Smoke Gets

In The News," right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And in that article � by the way, Life Magazine was a very pictorial magazine, right?

A.  Yes, it was the most popular pictorial large format magazine.

Q.  Here you go.  And here, we actually see the types of pictures that were published in Life Magazine in this 1953 article, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And although it's a little hard to see from a distance, it included pictures of the changes that were created on the shaved backs of mice when tobacco tar were painted on their backs, correct?

A.  Yeah, the little tumors that had been produced in the skin of the mice.

MR. FURR:  Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And that publication got a lot of attention, didn't it?

A.
	Well, it's � yeah, it's � it's � Life

Magazine was a popular magazine.
	
Q.
	And wouldn't you agree that by

presenting the information pictorially to the
	
public,
	that was real � that was a very powerful |i

way to
	present the information, wasn't it?

A.
	It was graphic, yes.

Q.
	And it was very impactful on the

public'
	s perception of the smoking, wasn't it?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	And not only was that study published in \

Life, but that Life story itself got a great deal \
	
of coverage in the press, didn't it?
	
A.
	Well, yeah, I guess so, yeah.

Q.
	At that time, Life Magazine was the most ;

widely
	read, oversized pictorial magazine being

published in the United States, wasn't it?
	
A.
	That's correct.

Q.
	(BY MR. FURR)  Now in 1953, Mr. Shulman

was 33
	years old, right?

A.

subscribed to Life Magazine?

A.  No, as I've said maybe before, I don't know anything about his biography.

Q.  Now this study of Wynder and Graham, not only was it published in Life Magazine, the story was picked up and presented in other magazines such as Time and Newsweek, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Do you know whether the Shulmans subscribed to Time Magazine?

A.  No.

Q.  Now, in your opinion, this 1953 mouse skin painting study that we've looked at was seen and reacted to so broadly that in the smoking public, it created what you describe as a health crisis in this country, correct?

A.  Yes.  Well, those are not just my words. Those are the tobacco industry's words, a crisis, an emergency, yeah, massively declining stock prices and cigarette consumption.

Q.  It is your opinion that that publication created a health crisis, right?

A.  Yes.

by the millions in the early 1950s, correct?

A.  It is.  It would be hard to find a more important one unless it was the Reader's Digest article.

Q.  Now I want to talk briefly about this. We spoke a little bit about the first pillar of consensus, the epidemiology studies, the second pillar, the animal studies.

I want to speak briefly about the third pillar, the chemical analytic studies.  Okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because one of the things that you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed on direct examination was a document written by Dr. Rodgman identifying certain compounds in cigarette smoke that are carcinogenic, right?  Correct?

A.  Yes.  Right.

Q.  And, by the way, Dr. Teague looked at that information in his 1953 review, correct?

A.  That's right, prior to when Rodgman was hired at Reynolds.

Q.  Dr. Teague, in that 1953 review of his, reported on studies that had identified chemicals in cigarette smoke that were thought to be

A.  That's right.

Q. And, of course, those were studies that had been published in the scientific literature, right?

A.  That's right.  He didn't have access to the other companies' identification of benzpyrene because those were still secret within Brown & Williamson.

Q.  The presence of carcinogens in tobacco smoke actually began being reported in the scientific literature in the 1940s, correct?

A.  I think even earlier.  Earlier � there are some even earlier examples.  In the 1930s, arsenic was one of the suspected carcinogens.

Q.  And by the 1950s, it was widely reported in the popular press to nonscientists, like the types of magazines we've been looking at, that there were carcinogens in cigarette smoke, right?

A.  It gets a lot of attention, yes.

Q.  Now I want to turn to what we � I jumped the gun a little bit.  I now want to turn back to Dr. Rodgman, because you and Mr. Gdansk! discussed Dr. Rodgman was hired at R.J. Reynolds and began conducting chemistry studies on

A.  Correct.

Q. And one of the things that he did was he identified chemicals in cigarette smoke that were thought to be carcinogenic, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And I think you were very forthcoming about this, but I want to be clear.  Isn't it true that every carcinogen that Dr. Rodgman identified was either already reported in the scientific literature or was reported soon thereafter?

A.  Yeah, I think that's generally fair.  Of course, some of the most important ones were discovered by Rodgman.

Q.  And, sir, you're not aware of any internal documents at R.J. Reynolds that identifies compounds in cigarette smoke that had not already been publicly reported or which were not made public soon thereafter; is that correct?

A.  Yes.  If you restrict your question to carcinogens, which is maybe what you intended, other compounds, of course, would not be known to the public because they were not � the additives were not being disclosed, the 630 additives that were added to cigarettes, but if you restrict your

A.  Got it.

Q.  You're quicker than I am.

Sir, isn't it true that in the McCoy trial, you were asked this question and gave this answer �

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  It's improper impeachment.

MR. FURR:  May I � do you want us to approach, Your Honor?  I can just read the question and then you �

MR. GDANSKI:  That would defeat the purpose.

THE COURT:  Let me hear the question first and then I'll decide.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  Sir, isn't it true that in the McCoy trial, you were asked this question:

Sir, you are not aware of any internal company documents at R.J. Reynolds in the 1950s that identified compounds in cigarette smoke that weren't either already public or made public soon thereafter; is that correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  I have the same

objection

is correct.

A.  Yeah, that's �

Q.  Did I read that correctly?

A.  You did.  That's what I just said.  I added the fact that the additives were not mentioned, but the other part is correct.

Q.  Okay.  I want to talk with you very briefly about the Plaza meeting and The Frank Statement that you and Mr. Gdanski discussed.

You and Mr. Gdanski discussed the fact that there was a meeting held in 1953 at the Plaza Hotel, right?

A.  Yes, December 14th and 15th, 1953.

Q.  And the then CEOs of the tobacco companies met there, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Sir, isn't it true that prior to that meeting, the tobacco companies told the United States Department of Justice that they were going to hold that meeting?

A.  That's true.

Q.  And isn't it true, sir, that after that meeting, the fact that the meeting had occurred was reported in The New York Times?

A.  That's true.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you and Mr. Gdanski looked at some of the statements contained in The Frank Statement, didn't you?

A.  We did.

Q. Sir, isn't it true that after The Frank Statement was published, there were surveys done to determine what effect The Frank Statement had on smokers?

A.  I know of one such survey. Q.  And isn't it true, sir, that one of the things that was observed in that survey was that some smokers �

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object as hearsay and speculative.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, survey evidence is going in by plaintiffs.

THE COURT:  It's already in evidence. MR. FURR:  No, other survey evidence was gone into by the plaintiff as well.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let's approach then.

MR. FURR:  My point �

THE COURT:  We're almost at 11:45, so this is the last question anyway.

MR. FURR:  My point is that plaintiffs were permitted, over our objection, to enter other surveys and discuss what they showed about what smokers knew and when they knew it.

This is the exact same thing.  This is my response to that.

THE COURT:  My only concern is that he's familiar with it?

MR. FURR: Yes. He knows about it. He just told us he knows about it.

MR. GDANSKI: But I � there's no doubt about that. I only put in surveys that were done at the request of the tobacco companies.

THE COURT: But he's not putting in the surveys.  He's just asking questions.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, it doesn't matter. It's still hearsay.  In other words, I �

THE COURT:  Oh, I know that, but a witness can rely � this type of witness can rely on hearsay.

about, you know, his � his reliance on certain

surveys.  So he's asking questions about the

surveys �

MR. GDANSKI:  But he's � he's asking him what the actual survey says.  So he's using it as a conduit for otherwise inadmissible hearsay.

The polls that I used � the surveys I used were commissioned by the defendants.

This is � I don't know.  I could be wrong.  If they're telling me it was commissioned by the defendants, that would be a different situation.

A.  Definitely.  It's consistent with the fact that large numbers of people didn't know it

Page 4927 MR. GDANSKI:  I have a couple questions

for the witness, just two.

THE COURT:  Two questions.  Is it going to take � is it real quick questions?

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Go ahead.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q.  Dr. Proctor, obviously, the Court is familiar with the idea that there have been historically cigarettes sold that have "light" and "low tar" descriptors on them.

And my question to you, the first one is:  Is that even allowed anymore?  In this country, can you have cigarettes sold legally that have the descriptors "light" and "low tar"?

A.  No, it's not legal.

Q.  And is that because it was found that those descriptors, "light" and "low tar," were deceptive and misled smokers into thinking that cigarettes that contained the descriptor "light" and "low tar" were less harmful?

A.  Yes.

Page 4928 Q.  Is that in keeping with the conduct of

the tobacco companies to deceive smokers that

cigarettes were not harmful?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Was that part of their fraud?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Four questions.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  If you guys think of any questions, follow-up to those, when we get back, that's what we'll start with before we bring the jury in.

MR. BRENNER:  We'll start with � I'm sorry, we'll start with any further voir dire?

THE COURT:  Any further voir dire, if anybody, based on those questions, wants to ask any, or based on anything else that Mr. Brenner, who had not done voir dire yesterday, wants to do.

MR. BRENNER:  And are you going to then entertain argument on the issue, or that's going to be a sidebar?

THE COURT: I don't know whether we'll do it at that point because I don't want to hold up the jury when we get back.

THE COURT:  I don't know.  Ask the deputy when he comes back out here.

Good afternoon

Q   We are going to do everything that we can to make sure that your sixth day is your last day of testifying in this case.

A    Thank you.

Q   We may have to go a little bit late, but we'11 do what we can to get you out of here.

When we broke, we were talking about information that the public had available to it about the dangers of smoking in the 1950s. Do you recall that?

A    Yes.

Q   One of the things that happened in the 1950s is that two very famous doctors named Dr. Hammond and Dr. Horn published an epidemiologic study of smoking and of lung cancer, correct?

A    They did?

Q   They were employees or sponsored by the American Cancer Society?

A    Yes.

Q   That epidemiology story that they published got a lot of coverage in the popular press, right?

A    It did.

Q   Newspapers, magazines, et cetera?

A    Yes.

involved in publicizing the results of that story,

correct?

A    Yes.

Q    And in publicizing the dangers of smoking, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    And actually you and Mr. Gdansk! looked at a video last time of a show where Dr. Hammond was appearing on a show called �

A    See It Now.

Q    See It Now, right?

A    In 1955, yes.

Q    The moderator was Edward Murrow, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Famous sort of news expose of the time, right ?

A    That's right.

Q I want to look back at the clip that you and Mr. Gdansk! showed and ask you a few questions about it.

MR. FURR:  That was plaintiff's in

follows:)

SPEAKER:  Good evening.  This is See It Now produced by the partnership of Friendly and Murrow.  Tonight the first of two reports on cigarettes and lung cancer.

SPEAKER:  In 1952, Doctors Hammond and Horn of the American Cancer Society began an extended study of the smoking habits of American men. Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the results of the first two years.

SPEAKER:  It is now established in my opinion without a reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking greatly increases the probability of contracting lung cancer.

In my opinion, people should be warned of the danger, and they are being warned.  What they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own business. (Thereupon, the video clip ended.) BY MR. FURR:

Q    That was Dr. Hammond, wasn't it? A    It was.

Q    Dr. Hammond was a very important and prominent public health scientist of the date, right?

becomes important.

Q   He becomes important.

One of the things we've been doing throughout this trial is looking backwards in time throughout the historical record to try to get at what smokers were being told at certain points in time, right?

A    Among other things.

Q   Dr. Hammond didn't have to look back.  He was sort of on the spot, wasn't he?

A    Yes.  He was a scientist, really making history.

Q   Right.  He was making the history.  He was a man talking about what he was observing in real-time, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   What Dr. Hammond, the public health scientist, told us was that people are being warned, correct?

A    That's what he said.

Q   Now, one of the things that you said the other day when you looked at this clip with Mr. Gdansk! is you found what Dr. Hammond said to be less than complete, because it did not include a

right ?

A    That was one thing he didn't really fully understand yet.

Q   Okay.  Notwithstanding that, Dr. Hammond said that people were being warned.  And this was, in fact, at a time when you told us the quitting actually began, in the mid-1950s, right?

A    Yes, largely in response to this type of science.

Q    This was an article that was condensed from a publication by the American Medical Association, right ?

A    I think that's correct.  I would have to double-check that.  I think that's correct.

Q    One of the things that the Reader's Digest � that was � one of the statements that was contained in this Reader's Digest article, "The Growing Horror of Lung Cancer," was heavy smokers apparently particularly subject to this disease should be aware of how desperately slim your chances of survival, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Object to hearsay. MR. FURR:  Being offered for notice, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Let me see here. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's right.  That's that 1950 idea that really only heavy smoking is dangerous.  It's only later that the emphasis is put on any smoking is dangerous.  In the '50s the idea was you shouldn't smoke too much.  That is a part of what's going on here.

Q    In 1959, in that article, they actually describe lung cancer from smoking as becoming an epidemic in 1959, don't they?

A    That's right.

Q   Of course Mr. Shulman would have been 39 years old at that time, right?

A    That's right.

Q   As you told us, throughout this time, as we crept forward in time, we were getting closer to the time when quitting accelerated in this country, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    I want to jump to 1964.  Because we've talked about it several times, I wanted to add a few more details.  In 1964, of course, the Surgeon General's report on smoking health was issued, correct?

A    It was.

Q    In that report, the Surgeon General's committee concluded that smoking was a cause of lung cancer, right?

A    Yes.

Q   That report received a great deal of media coverage, didn't it?

Q   It was headline news all across the country, right?

A    That's right.

Q   The report was released on a Sunday, correct?

A    I think it was a Saturday, actually.

Q   Saturday?

A    Yeah.

Q    Isn't it correct that, for the next several days, major newspapers across this country ran stories about the Surgeon General's report that were their lead story?

A    That's true.

Q In other words, they would have been on the top of the front page above the fold, the first story that you see when you pick up a newspaper, right?

A    For a couple days, that's true.

Q   You don't know what newspapers Mr. Shulman read, do you?

A    No.

Q   Would you have expected articles about the Surgeon General's report to have been run and published in the major Boston newspapers the two days after the Surgeon General's report?

Page 4946 introduced, they were attacked.  The attacks

took a new turn 10 years ago and culminated in

today's report by the Surgeon General's

committee.

This, in summary, is what the committee says.  Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women smokers points the same way.  Cigarette smoking is a cigarette cause of cancer of the larynx, and probably the most important cause of chronic bronchitis.  Cigarette smoking may be related to other lung disease.  Males have a much higher death rate from heart disease, although it's not proven that smoking is the cause.

On the question of filters, the committee says there is no evidence that they do any good, but it didn't exclude the possibility that an effective filter might be developed.  In short, the committee says if you smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.

The Surgeon General's committee presented its report at a news conference in Washington.

SPEAKER:  After long and exhaustive

Page 4947 deliberations the committee has reached the

overall judgment that cigarette smoking is a

health hazard of sufficient importance to the

United States to warrant remedial action.

This overall judgment was supported by many converging lines of evidence, as well as by data indicating that cigarette smoking is related to higher death rates and a number of disease categories.

More specifically, the committee states on page 61 of the report, and I quote, In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate.

SPEAKER:  In this kind of a country, it comes down to you, whether you like it or not. No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him either.  The decision is his.  The decision and the health that may depend on it.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, I want to ask you a few follow-up questions.  That was an example of the coverage, but similar coverage was presented to the public on the other networks also, correct?

A    Yes, similar and opposite.  In other words, there's also the response from the industry on the other networks.

Q    Yeah.  As you've already told us, it was on this network also.

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  At the beginning of that program, Mr. Reasoner said something to the effect of the attack on cigarettes took a new turn 10 years ago. Did you hear that?

A    Yes, referencing back to the mouse painting experiments.

Q    He's in '64, he's referencing back to the mouse painting experiments, and perhaps to the growing human studies, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  Of course, in 1964, Mr. Shulman would have been 44 years old, right?

A    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to have to object, Judge.  This area has been covered.

MR. FURR:  I have not asked this question, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  The entire if you know nothing, you also know this. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I thought I answered about 20 times that question.  I don't know anything about what he saw, heard, relied on, knew, experienced.  So my answer would be the same on this one. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Now, at the very end of that program, Mr. Reasoner looked in the camera and said something to the effect that now that this information is out, the decision is the smoker's decision and it's a decision that the smoker has to make and that his health may depend upon, right? A    That's right.  That's what he says. Q    Again, you � you and Mr. Gdanski talked about this, and you expressed some thoughts about how that statement was inadequate because it did not

A    Well, sure.  I mean, there's several things

in that.  For example, he says no one is going to

advise people to smoke.

Q    I'm only asking you what you and

Mr. Gdanski said.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object to him not allowing

him to answer the question.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    I'm not asking you further opinions.  I'm

asking you about what you and Mr. Gdanski talked

about in this courtroom.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object to badgering

the witness.  He is entitled to explain his

answer.

THE COURT:  What's the pending question?

MR. FURR:  The pending question is, when

Mr. Gdanski was asking you questions, you

specifically � the criticism, the only

criticism that you voiced in this courtroom in

front of this jury was that that statement did

not refer to addiction.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge.  That is not

the same question that Mr. Furr asked and Dr.

Proctor was answering.

that was the question or not.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  He changed the

question.

THE COURT:  The witness can answer.

THE WITNESS:  Several questions have been

asked.

BY MR. FURR:

q   we>re focused on the last one.

MR. GDANSKI:  He's in the middle of

answering a question.

THE WITNESS:  That was one objection, is

that there's not -- addiction is not well

understood, obviously, by Mr. Reasoner, but also

to the scientific community at this time.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Notwithstanding that, you've already told

us today that that report in 1964 was, in fact, the

turning point on smoking prevalence in this country,

haven't you?

MR. GDANSKI:  If he said that today, then I

object as asked and answered.

cancer �

really was scaring people. BY MR. FURR:

Q    In fact, as you've told us, in the years following that report, notwithstanding it's very reference to addiction, that's when we began the heavy � the decades of heavy quitting of smoking in this country, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   All right.  I want to talk with you a little bit about how that Surgeon General's report was put together and one of the things that scientists at R.J. Reynolds did to assist the Surgeon General in constructing that report, okay?  Because that's a topic you and Mr. Gdanski spoke about on direct, the company's submissions to the Surgeon General's report, right ?

A    Yes.  We didn't call it assistance.

Q   Well, I'm going to ask you about something specifically here.  We've already talked about Dr. Rodgman, the chemist at R.J. Reynolds, right?

A    Yes.

smoke, right ?

A    That's right.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that all of the compounds that R.J. Reynolds had identified through the work of Dr. Rodgman were disclosed to the advisory committee to the Surgeon General in 1964?

A    Yes.  Yes, they were actually already public, as we've already said.

Q    They were disclosed to the Surgeon General in a submission from R.J. Reynolds, correct?

A    Yes.  Actually, it was a submission by Philip Morris on behalf of Reynolds and all of the other companies.

Q    And none of the compounds that R.J. Reynolds had identified in cigarette smoke were omitted from that submission to the Surgeon General, were they?

A    That's right.

Q    Okay.  Now, in fact, sir, isn't it true that that submission included some new and previously unknown compounds that Dr. Rodgman had discovered?

A    That's right.  Compounds like methacholine, benzopyrene, and a number of other polycyclics that he had identified.

Q    Isn't it true, sir, that in the 1964 report, the Surgeon General identified the carcinogens in cigarette smoke in part by � in part through the contribution that R.J. Reynolds had made by submitting those compounds to the committee?

A    Yes.  But they were not identified as carcinogens by Reynolds.  They were � the identification was made independently by the Surgeon General's committee.

Q    Sir, over time, beginning with Dr. Rodgman's work, isn't it true that the scientists at R.J. Reynolds over the years discovered about half of the compounds that actually appeared in cigarette smoke?

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Dr. Proctor, let's look at � let's remind ourself what, in fact, happened.  In 1966, this label, Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health, began to appear on all packages of cigarettes made and sold in the United States, correct?

A    Correct.

Q    The language of that warning � well, let me say it this way:  You labeled it caution, right?

A    Yeah, it's a caution.

Q    A caution is a synonym for warning.

A    It can be.  It's a little weaker actually. The warning that comes on later is stronger.  Usually we say a caution is milder, warning is stronger.

Q    If you were to look up synonyms for caution, one of the words you would find is "warning," right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  It's

outside the scope and irrelevant.

MR. FURR:  I don't understand that

objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll withdraw the objection.

We'll see what's on the next board. THE COURT:  All right.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    We talked about caution.  If you were to go the other direction, if you were to look at the definition of warning or look up synonyms for warning, you would see the word "caution," wouldn't you?

A    Yeah, a caution is like a weak warning.

Q    Sir, you would agree that there's no dispute that every package of cigarettes that Mr. Shulman purchased after the day of 1966 that this label was required to be put on the packages would, in fact, have carried this caution label?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Asked and

answered.

MR. FURR:  I have not asked this question. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  It would. BY MR. FURR:

Q    In other words, there's no question but that Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, Liggett, the American Tobacco Company, they all complied with the requirement to put that cautionary label on their packages, didn't they?

A    They did.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that there was a

States about the fact that this caution label was now

required to appear on cigarette packages?

A    It was reported in the press, that's correct.

Q   Sir, one of the things that began happening in the late 1960s and early 1970s were that public service announcements began running on television with respect to the dangers of smoking, right?

A    Yes, as part of The Fairness Doctrine.

Q   You and Mr. Gdanski showed a couple of those, didn't you?

A    Yes.

Q   I want to look at a couple more because, sir, isn't it also true that there were public service announcements run on television that were, in fact, designed to draw the attention of the watcher to the warning label, to the caution label on packages?

A    There were some, yes.

Q   The American Cancer Society was one of the organizations that developed public service announcements about the dangers of smoking, right?

A    It did.

Yeah.  I thought that's what you just asked

Q    Now I added the American Cancer Society.

A    Okay.

MR. FURR:  I want to look, Your Honor, at AN 947, an American Cancer Society public service announcement for demonstrative purposes.

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object to it being introduced into evidence, Judge.

THE COURT:  He's only using it for demonstrative purposes.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's not in evidence.

THE COURT:  So you object to it being used as a demonstrative?

MR. GDANSKI:  I do not.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. FURR:  Could you play that, please. (Thereupon, the video clip was played and transcribed as follows:)

Q   That was an American Cancer Society public service announcement designed to draw the watcher's attention to the label on the side of cigarette packages, right ?

A    It was.

Q    In fact, that public service announcement expressly states that paying attention to this warning may save your life, right?

A    That's right.

Q In addition to the televised public service announcements, the American Cancer Society also produced some print media, posters and other types of things to place in doctor's offices and other public places designed to accomplish the same goal; that is, to make sure that people were aware of the caution on the side of the package, right?

A    Yes.

Q   The American Cancer Society also developed slightly different types of public service announcements, those being public service announcements designed to advise smokers of the

MR. FURR:  I'd like to play as a demonstrative, Your Honor, AN 947 as a demonstrative.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, can we approach for a moment?

THE COURT:  Sure. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. GDANSKI:  I did not object to the last one because we played public service announcements and discussed warnings, but I do object to this.  I object to this � it's not their case in chief.  It's not in evidence.  We object to it coming into evidence.  So this public service announcement I object to being used as a demonstrative.

MR. FURR:  It's a demonstrative.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object to this as a demonstrative.  In other words, it's not in evidence.

THE COURT:  What's the purpose of the objection?  How is it any different than any public service announcement that you've used or that's already been played?

THE COURT:  What's the nature of the objection to it going into evidence?

MR. GDANSKI:  They can't introduce evidence in my case in chief.  This is not their case. They don't get to introduce evidence until we have rested and they put on their case.  That's basic.

THE COURT:  I've never heard of that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can bring you Erhardt right now.

MR. FURR:  We don't even need to get there. I didn't offer it into evidence.  It's a demonstrative.

THE COURT:  Both sides offer things all the time, whether it's on cross or it's on direct.

information being provided to smokers.

I'll let it in as a demonstrative. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

Q    Dr. Proctor, that was sort of the flip side of the last PSA that we looked at.  The last we looked at warned people that they could prevent � that they might save their life by quitting, right?

A    Yes.

Q   You and Mr. Gdanski talked about Dr. Daniel Horn on direct examination, right?

A    That's right.

Q   Mr. Gdanski asked you about statements you had seen from Dr. Horn, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Including the statement you had seen from Dr. Horn that you could shout it from the rooftops and you won't be � and you won't tell anybody something they don't know, smoking being dangerous, right ?

A    He's quoted to that effect.

Q   Well, I don't know if he quoted or paraphrased it.  We'll look at the quote, okay?

A    Yes.

Q   Let's back up and make sure we know who Dr. Horn is.  We earlier talked about, when we were talking about Dr. Hammond and the See It Now program, the underlying study.  The epidemiology study that Dr. Hammond was � that began to make Dr. Hammond's career, as you told us, was actually studied by Hammond and Horn, right?

A

Yes

Q    Horn being the second investigator?

A    Yes.  Two people working for the American Cancer Society doing prospective epidemiology.  In other words, taking healthy people and looking forward to see whether the smokers or the non-smokers were more likely to get lung cancer.

Q    At that time, Dr. Horn worked for the American Cancer Society, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Dr. Horn later became the director of the U.S. National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, correct?

A    That's right.

Q    And as you explained to the jury last week, that is the office of the Government that has responsibility for producing Surgeon General's reports, right?

A    It is.

Q    And as we've just seen, Dr. Horn from time to time made public statements that included his perspective of how information about the dangers of smoking was being communicated to the public, right?

A    He said things like that.

can stand on a rooftop and shout smoking is dangerous

right ?

Q Of course, Mr. Shulman would have been 48 years old at that time, right?

Q   You and Mr. Gdansk! talked about the warning that went on cigarette packages in 1970, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   One of the things you talked about was how this warning was different because of the attribution of the warning, right?

A Yeah. It was strengthened, it's a warning and not just a caution. It's also attributed to the Surgeon General.

Q Let's make sure we know exactly what that warning was. Beginning of 1970, January 1st, 1970, isn't it true that every cigarette package was

Page 4967 required to carry this warning, quote, Warning:  The

Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking

is dangerous to your health, right?

A    That's right.  Whereas, the early one had said it may be harmful, this one says it is harmful.

Q   Wouldn't you agree that after the effective date of this warning, every package of cigarettes that Mr. Shulman would have purchased in the United States from that date until 1985 would have carried this warning?

A    Yes.

Q    Wouldn't you agree that after 1971, every cigarette advertisement, print advertisement that Mr. Shulman would have seen in the United States would have carried this warning?

A    Yes.  Unless you're including like banners in stadiums, things like that, which are printed. But I think by "print" you mean like in magazines.

Q    Sure.

A    That would be true.

Q    There's no dispute that the defendants in this case, all of the companies in this case, always put this warning label on the side of their packages between those years?

A    That's correct.

Page 4968 Q    Of course in 1970, the year that that

warning took effect, Mr. Shulman turned 50 years old,

right ?

A    Yes.  Just to be clear, it was very tiny. It's not as big as that poster.

Q    Well, in fact, sir, the size of the warning, how large the warning would be was, in fact, dictated by the United States Congress, wasn't?

A    Partly.  They said it should be visible. Q    How large the warning would be was determined by the U.S. Congress, right?

A    Partly.  It was in general terms, not exact terms, but it was partly determined by that.

Q    Could I have the Banks trial testimony from our February 14th date that we spent together last year in 2014.  Page � it contains page 2031.

through 12.

A    Right.

Q   Let me ask you first to back up and look at

page 2030 and confirm that the lines that I referred

you to were in the context of a discussion about the

1970 warning label.

A    They are.

Q   Okay.  Beginning at line 5:  Isn't it true

that you were asked the following questions and gave

the following answers:

Question:  Again, Congress determined

exactly what the language of the warning would be,

right ?

Your answer was:  Yes.

Question:  And Congress determined where

the warning would be placed on packages?

Answer:  That's right.

Question:  And how large the warning would

be, right ?

Your answer was:  Yes.

Did I read those questions and answers

A    Yes.  That's what I just said.  It's just

that they were done in general terms.  For example,

if you look at the warnings, they all have different

colors.

Q    Dr. Proctor, the only question I was

asking �

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, he's in the middle of

explaining an answer.  I think that the witness

is entitled to explain an answer.

MR. FURR:  I don't think if I read the

record correctly requires an explanation.

THE COURT:  I think he was already

responsive to the question.

Ask your next question.

MR. GDANSKI:  He was in the middle of

talking.

MR. FURR:  Yes, sir.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  Just to round out this discussion

about warnings, Dr. Proctor, in 1985, united States

Congress again changed the warning label, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Beginning in 1985, did Congress determine

that packages of cigarettes should carry one of four

Q   And that those warning labels would rotate throughout the year, correct?

A    That's right.

Q   So approximately an even number of packages and advertisements would be � would carry each of these warning labels throughout the year, right?

A    That was the intent.

Q   Those labels included, first, Surgeon General's warning:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   Second, Surgeon General's warning:  Smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury, premature birth and low birth weight, correct?

A    Right.

Q   Third, Surgeon General's warning: Cigarette smoking now greatly reduces serious risk to your health, right?

A    I think you meant quitting.

Q   Excuse me.  Surgeon General's warning: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risk to your health, correct?

mischaracterizations.

MR. FURR:  It's not a mischaracterization.

MR. GDANSKI:  Let's see.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I think I said little or nothing.  I actually mentioned the fact that there's what I call seepage, about a dozen studies among the 7,000 peer-reviewed published studies that actually found some evidence of harm.  And the pattern for several of those was to have the money cut off when there was evidence of harm. BY MR. FURR:

Q    So your testimony now is little or nothing to do with smoking and health.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  That mischaracterizes.  He referenced leakage on direct.

MR. FURR:  That's what he just told me, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  And on direct. Mischaracterize his testimony. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Is that correct?

to answer the questions that are being asked of

him.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Your testimony has little or nothing to do

with smoking and health, which I've abbreviated as

S&H, correct?

A    The better way to say it is smoking causing

harm because smoking and health is kind of a

misnomer.  Cigarettes causing harm.

A    Yeah.

Q   That's your testimony?

A    99 percent, yeah.

Q   Okay.  Well, let's look at some of the types of studies that CTR funded and compare them to that statement.  Let's back up a little bit and think � give the jury some more information about how the CTR funded projects came to be.

The predecessor organization to the CTR, which is short for Council for Tobacco Research, was an organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?

A    Yes.

Q   Can you explain how over time the Tobacco Industry Research Committee split off into CTR and TI; in other words, the Tobacco Institute, the public relations firm, right?

A    Right.

Q    In the early 1950s, there, in fact, were calls from the Public Health Community for the tobacco industry to create some sort of research organization, correct?

Q    In the 1954 Frank Statement, the tobacco industry announced that they would create a research organization, correct?

A    They did.

Q That was originally the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  The TIRC, right?

A    Correct.

Q   As we've explained, the name changed to CTR over time, right?

A    Yes, in 1964.

Q   We'11 use CTR because your testimony is really the same with respect to TIRC and CTR, right?

A    It is.

Q The CTR was an organization that funded, provided monies to people who made applications so that they could conduct their research, right?

A    Yes.  It itself is entirely funded by the tobacco companies.

Q   That was going to be my next point.  The CTR did not have any way to obtain funds.  It didn't operate as a for profit business, did it?

A    No.

Q   It was funded solely by the cigarette manufacturers, right ?

Page 4977 A    That's right.

Q    Over the time that the CTR was funding research, it funded about $350 million of research; is that correct?

A    Yes, that's in real dollars at the time.

Q    So in other words, in today's dollars it would be significantly more than that?

A    It would, if you adjusted for inflation.

Q    All right.  We're going to talk about the type of research that CTR funded.  Again, I want to give you what you're due.  You're very forthcoming about the high quality scientists and the institutions that CTR funded, correct?

A    That's just the truth.

Q   That's the truth.  I want to elaborate on that a little bit.  I appreciate you bringing that the jury's attention.

The CTR and TIRC did fund some excellent scientists, right?

A    Yeah.  It was high quality bio research, genetics research, biochemical research, genomic research, immunology.

Q    The CTR, as you told the jury, you also told them this, that individual scientists who were funded by the CTR, some of them subsequently went on

Page 4979 if the research merits it, is they write scientific

results and report the results of their studies,

right?

A    Yeah, they're supposed to if they find any results.

Q    The studies funded by the CTR resulted in about 7,000 different scientific articles being published in the scientific literature, correct?

A    That's right.  I said that a couple times.

Q    Those articles were published in highly respected peer-reviewed journals, right?

A    Many of them were, yes.

Q    Will you tell the jury who Dr. Herbert Lombard was?

A    Herbert Lombard was one of the very early epidemiologists who already in 1929 found early evidence that smoking was causing lung cancer.

Q    Dr. Lombard was a pioneering researcher on the relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, correct?

A    That's right, prior even to the 1950s.

Q    As you've said, in the 1920s, he conducted one of the earliest studies of lung cancer and cigarette smoking, one of the earliest epidemiology studies, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  It's one thing to talk about it in historical context, talk generally about what type of research was done, but to say what a study concluded, I object to.

I tried to ask a very similar, if not identical, question as it related to the mouse painting studies from 1953.  I tried to talk about what the actual conclusions were of the mouse painting studies.  Your Honor said no. Your Honor said I could show the magazine that it was reported because that goes to notice, but talking specifically about what was contained

THE COURT:  What are you offering it for?

MR. FURR:  To prove the fact that it was said, that the CTR funded a study that said this.  This witness testified that the CTR did not fund any research about whether smoking causes disease.  That's what this study did.  I have to show the jury that, in fact, not only did we fund this research, research was adverse to us.  I'm not trying to prove that what he said was true.  That's the last thing that we're trying to do.  I'm trying to prove that it happened.

that find any kind of harm whatsoever.  That's

much -- you'd have to have 70 for it to be even

reports because they cited a lot of basic biology,

that smoking causes COPD?

A    Very rarely.

Q    It happened, didn't it?

A    Yeah, it's like the history of exceptions. It's extremely rare.  I'm not even sure they ever said those actual words, but things along those lines in extremely few cases.

Q    Well, we'll look a little bit closer at those studies.

A    I doubt there's a single one that actually uses those exact words, smoking causes lung cancer. I'd be very surprised.

Q    Let's look a little closer at COPD studies and what they said, okay?

Sir, would you agree that the historical record indicates that a key advancement in our understanding of the disease process of COPD and its relationship to cigarette smoking or studies which showed that the decline in lung function with age was accelerated by smoking?

A    That's part of the story, right.

Q    It was a key advancement, wasn't it?

A    It's an advance, yes.

Q    In fact, sir, isn't it true that the CTR

Page 4986 funded studies which show that the decline in lung

function accelerates and occurs faster in smokers

than in nonsmokers?

A    Yes, there are a few of those.  That's part of that 1 percent.

Q    Isn't it true that the CTR funded epidemiology studies which found that smokers had diminished lung function compared to nonsmokers?

A    Yes.

Q   Would you tell the jury who Dr. Raymond Bossey was?

A    He was one of the early COPD researchers in the '70s and '80s.

Q   Dr. Bossey published CTR funded studies over a period of six years which made findings on the relationship between cigarette smoking and the development of lung injury consistent with COPD, correct?

A    That's right.

Q    In 1975, the CTR funded an epidemiology study by Dr. Bossey which found that the intensity or depth of smoke inhalation had the largest effect on decline in lung function over time, correct?

A    He did.

Q   Sir, wouldn't you agree that the 1975 study

Page 4987 by Dr. Bossey funded by the CTR helped advance the

state of scientific knowledge on the effect of

inhalation of cigarette smoke on the risk of lung

cancer and declining lung function?

A    I agree.

Q Wouldn't you agree, sir, that Dr. Bossey and his co-workers did follow-up research that was funded by the CTR in 1980 and 1981?

A    That's right.

Q   Wouldn't you agree, sir, that taken as a whole, the CTR funded studies by Dr. Bossey helped advance the state of scientific knowledge on the relationship between cigarette smoking and COPD?

A    Somewhat, yes.

Q    I want to ask you about another line of CTR funded research on COPD.  That's the work done by Dr. Janoff.

You know who Dr. Janoff is, don't you?

A    Yes, though you'd have to refresh my memory.

Q    I will.

Emphysema is one of the diseases that comprises COPD, right?

A    Correct.

Q    Isn't it true, sir, that the CTR funded Dr. Janoff to publish about a dozen studies between 1977 and 1983?

A    Yes.  They actually funded him and later he published those studies.

Q    In fact, in 1977, 1978 and 1979 Dr. Janoff published studies about CTR funded work which provided evidence that smoking causes emphysema, right ?

A    To a degree, yes.

Q    You agree it was very good research, wasn't it?

A    I think it's not bad, yes.

Q    In 1982, Dr. Janoff published a CTR funded study that provided evidence of the mechanism of cigarette smoking causing emphysema in humans that he had done on animals, right?

A    That's right.  That's part of that list you already gave.

Q   You would agree that the research done by Dr. Janoff helped advance the state of scientific knowledge as to how cigarette smoking causes emphysema in humans, right?

Q    Now, you said that Janoff's work was not bad, but it was a little better than that, wasn't it?

A    It's good work, yeah.

Q    In fact, it was great work, wasn't it?

A    I'm not sure I'd call it great, but it's good.

Q    Would you please tell the jury what the Alton Ochsner reward related to smoking and health is?

A    It's one of the rewards given to researchers in smoking and health.

Q    The Ochsner Award is given for outstanding and exemplary, original scientific investigations that relate tobacco consumption with disease, right?

A    That's correct.

Q    Obviously human smoking and disease?

A    Yes.

Q    It's a very, very prestigious award, isn't it?

A    It's prestigious.

Q    You would like to win that award, wouldn't you?

A    Yes, but I'd never heard of it until I started testifying.

Q    Not only that, you would consider it a lifetime achievement award for your work on tobacco in history and smoking health, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, I object.  It's argumentative and irrelevant. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's actually just the definition of it.  It's called the lifetime achievement award. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Janoff was nominated for, and, in fact, won the Ochsner award for his research in the links between cigarette smoking and emphysema, correct? A    He did, that's right.

Q    That's work that we've been discussing that the CTR helped fund, right? A    Yes.

Q    Wouldn't you agree, sir, that CTR funded studies which included that smoking is addicting?

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I'm going to object. It's inappropriate.  CTR is by finding a co-conspirator.

Q   We talked about Dr. Bossey a moment ago and the work that he did on the decline of lung function with smoking, right?

A    That's right.

Q   Dr. Bossey also did work on cigarette smoking and addiction, didn't he?

A    Limited, yes.

Q    In fact, Dr. Bossey did some CTR funded work on smoking and addiction, right?

A    Yes, in which the word addiction is used.

Q    In fact, in 1981, Dr. Bossey published a CTR funded study which stated that, quote, Nicotine has been extensively and convincingly implicated as the addicting agent in tobacco, right?

A    I think that's actually a quote.

Q   CTR funded work?

A    Yes.

Q   In fact, that statement was made seven years before the Surgeon General of the United States came out with his 1988 report you've talked about, right ?

cigarette design; is that correct?

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that based upon your historical review of this issue, you would agree that there is no such thing as a safe cigarette?

A    Well, the only truly safe one would be one you didn't smoke.

Q    The only truly safe cigarette is one you don't smoke.

A    Yes.

Q    Okay.  Sir, you would agree that nicotine is a chemical that occurs naturally in tobacco, right ?

A    That's true.  It's found naturally and artificially.  In other words, it is there naturally, but it's also manipulated, so it's both natural and artificial.

Q I promise you we will talk about the manipulation of tobacco. So you won't lose my question, it occurs naturally in tobacco.

Q    Sir, you probably recognize that tobacco is still grown in some parts of Florida.  Are you aware of that?

A    It is, in northern Florida.

Q    It's probably been harvested by now, but if you would have gone to a tobacco field in northern Florida when the leaf was still on the stalk, and you pulled a leave from that plant, dried it and lit it, would you create smoke, right?

A    Yes.

Q    If you analyze that smoke from the tobacco leaf as it grows in the ground, you would find that that smoke contains thousands of chemicals, right?

A    Correct.

Q   That's before the tobacco companies have done anything to manufacture the cigarette, right?

A    Yes.  I think there's also engineering that goes into the planting and the seed development and all of that sort of thing.  But apart from that, yes.

Q    The smoke that you would derive from burning that tobacco leaf that you pulled off the plant, dried and burned would include carcinogens,

14
	cigarettes could be made safer by making them

15
	noninhalable, correct?

16

A    Yes.

Q    That was the demonstrative that you and

Mr. Gdanski looked at.

Do you recall that?

A    Yes.

Q    You explained to us that flue curing is simply heating the tobacco in the barn, really, right ?

A    Yeah, the flues are tubes.  You put the fire through the tubes so you don't burn down the barn, and the heat traps the sugar, which makes it inhalable.

Q    Nothing very high tech about that, is there?

A    Not really.  It's not very high tech, really.

Q    In fact, you could place tobacco in your oven and heat it in a way that would trap the sugars and make the smoke from that tobacco more inhalable, right ?

A    That's right.  Or even very bright sun on a roof, the way they do in the Mediterranean when they're making Turkish tobacco.  That heat can also trap the sugar and produce a sugary inhalable leaf.

Page 4998 Q    Now, I want to go a little bit deeper.  You

and Mr. Gdanski did talk to us about the origin of

inhalable tobacco.  I want to look a little bit

closer at that issue.

A    Okay.

Q    Let's start this way.  Wouldn't you agree that R.J. Reynolds and the other cigarette manufacturers, including Philip Morris and Liggett, did not invent inhalable tobacco?

A    That's right.  That's right.  It's much older.

Q    In fact, inhalable tobacco may well go back thousands of years, right?

A    It's possible any time that someone would have added any type of sugar to the leaf or would have dried it in such a way that involved heat, it's very likely that the smoke could have been inhaled.

Q    You think it probably goes back thousands of years, right?

A    It almost certainly would, just given the heterogeneity of use and how so many different tribes have used tobacco in the Americas, certainly some of them would have been inhaling.

Q    Let's stick with that because you referenced some of that the other day with

You recognized that Native Americans in the

United States were making their tobacco inhalable

long before any of these defendants existed, right?

A Occasionally, yes. I'm sure that was not the dominant practice. We do have graphic accounts which report inhalation, but it can't be very common.

Q    One of the things that is important is Native Americans were adding sugars to their tobacco as they were drying, right?

A    It can't have been refined sugars, because they didn't have that, but things like burnt syrup or maple syrup, which is used by the Native Americans, or other extracts from fruits.  In other words, given that there was so many hundreds of different tribes, you could imagine there being all different types of local practices, some of which must have produced inhalable tobaccos.

Q    You used a phrase I want to make sure we understand, ethnographic reports.

A    Yes.

Q    Could you explain what that means to us?

A    These would be travel literature, the Lewis & Clark Expedition, early anthropologists, French trappers talking to the northern Midwestern Indians

Page 5000 or southern Canadians.  There are early

anthropological reports that talk about the practices

of native people observing whether they're inhaling

or not, that sort of thing.  You can search the large

mass of Google books and actually find examples of

this fairly quickly.

Q    While we've got the historian on the stand, we'll do another mini history lesson.

A    Okay.

Q    The Lewis & Clark Expedition, which you just referenced, was a very famous expedition where President Thomas Jefferson commissioned Lewis & Clark to lead an expedition from Missouri across the entire continent to the Pacific Ocean, right?

A That's right. There were questions like are there mastodons living east of the Rockies and things like that.

Q    That expedition began the year 1804, right?

A    Correct.

Q    And as you suggested, one of the things that happened when people were conducting expeditions in those times would be they would keep travel journals, right?

A    That's right.

Q   We have access to the journals they kept,

Q    Their diaries.

One of the things that you see in the journals that were kept on the Lewis & Clark Expedition is you see descriptions of Native Americans smoking tobacco products and inhaling them and holding the smoke within their lungs, right?

A    They are a few examples, yes.

Q    Inhalable smoke, in other words?

A    Yes.

Q    As you've told us, in addition to what we know about Native Americans, we also know that inhalable tobacco was being developed halfway around the world in the Middle East and in the north African area, right?

A    That's right.  In those hot areas where tobacco was cured on the rooftops in the Mediterranean.  You got a type of leaf called Oriental or Turkish tobacco.  That too tended to be inhalable given the high sugar that was left in the leaf.

Q    Let's talk about Turkish tobacco.

A    Yes.

A    Yes.

Q    As you described it, it is tobacco that was sun cured, correct?

A    Yes, typically on the roofs of Mediterranean house.

Q   Before flue cured tobacco was being used commonly in cigarettes, the primary form of tobacco that was used in cigarettes in this country was Turkish tobacco, right?

A    That's right.

Q    Turkish tobacco is inhalable, correct?

A    Yes, generally.  As long as it's cured in that manner, it will be.  If you air cured it, it would not be inhalable.  But what you've said is correct.

Q    The historical record demonstrates that the characteristic of a cigarette that makes it easily inhalable goes all the way back to at least the 1830s with Turkish tobacco, right?

A    Yes.  And possibly, as we said, thousands of years earlier.  So long as people are adding sugar or heating the tobacco during its curing process, it would be inhalable.

Page 5003 came into existence as a corporation?

A    Well, in its modern form -- it's not really formed until after the 1911 Sherman Antitrust Act. So that's when it's reconstituted, following the formation of the trust under the Duke.  So it has sort of a Pre World War I existence and then kind of a new incarnation after 1911.

Q    Do you know when Philip Morris came into existence?

A    It starts off as kind of a little shop, sort of a gentlemen's royal shop in the 19th Century, but its modern corporate form is really not until the 20th Century.

Q    Do you know when Liggett came to exist in its modern corporate form?

A    I don't recall the date for that.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that back in the 1860s and 1870s the most popular form of tobacco that would have been used in cigarettes in the United States would have been Turkish tobacco?

A    Yes.  I thought you already asked that.

Q    Sir, you, as part of your review of the historical record, you have seen statements made by science writers indicating that in the 1860s that cigarettes were inhalable, correct?

Page 5004 A    You are � that's the earliest I've found

any reference to that, was in the 1860s.

Q    In those same types of articles by science writers, you have seen statements that it was inhalability of cigarettes that made them uniquely dangerous compared to other forms of tobacco, like pipes and cigars, right?

A   Yeah, that's the earliest reference to that that I found.

Q    That, of course, was being reported about a half century before R.J. Reynolds ever came into existence in its modern corporate form, right?

A    That's right.  Reynolds doesn't even start making cigarettes until 1912.

Q    Sir, isn't it true that, in your review of the historical record, you have encountered information from science writers that virtually 90 percent of cigarette smokers who smoked on a regular basis were inhaling the smoke in the 1870s and 1880s?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Hearsay. MR. FURR:  I'll ask the

question differently, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right. BY MR. FURR:

and 1880s, that virtually 90 percent of smokers who

smoked on a regular basis were inhaling their smoke?

A    I've seen quotes exactly referencing that fact.  I'm not sure those were scientific studies doing that, but on the other hand, I think it's actually true that people who were smoking cigarettes were almost all -- were very often inhaling them, if they're using flue cured Turkish.  If they're using air cured, they wouldn't be.

Q    I want to ask you a few questions about comparing the dangers and addictiveness of these cigarettes being made in the 1800s compared to the modern cigarettes manufactured by these defendants, okay?

A    Yes.

Q    Sir, wouldn't you agree that the historical record demonstrates that cigarettes made in the 1800s were not any less addictive than cigarettes made today?

A    In principle, that could be true and may well be true.  There's some qualifiers there because one of the things involved in addiction is ease of use, and anything that facilitates ease of use facilitates addiction, facilitates initiation,

those things have been changed over time.  So on a

pure puff basis, I would tend to agree with you on

that, but in terms of the culture of how easy it

becomes to smoke, there are ways in which it's become

easier and, therefore, indirectly more addictive.

Question:  And those cigarettes in the

1800s were not any less addictive than the cigarettes

sold today, correct?

Your answer was:  I agree.

A    Right.

Q    Did I read that correctly?

A    Right.  That's what I just said.  I just

explained it a little bit more.

Q    Okay.  Sir, isn't it true that the

historical record demonstrates that cigarettes from

the 1800s were just as dangerous as cigarettes sold

today?

THE WITNESS:  In principle, especially if

we're talking about --

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  � on a per puff basis, there

are some reasons they become more dangerous just

because they may become more likely to be used.

They become cheaper, there are all kinds of

things that facilitate use that increase danger.

They become easier to inhale with additives,

things like that.  But on a per puff basis, they

are just as dangerous.  So there are different

ways to define danger.  That's important to keep

in mind.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    The cigarettes from the 1800s weren't any

safer than the cigarettes sold today, were they?

A    Not in principle, but there are certain

things that happened in between that made them more

dangerous.

A    That's right.  That's what I just said with elaboration.

Q    Let's talk about flue curing for a minute. R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris and Liggett did not invent flue curing, did they?

A    Yeah, you already asked me about that, that's correct.

Q    In fact, they had nothing to do with the invention of flue curing, did they?

A    No.  They had only to do with turning it into a mass industrial enterprise.  They ramped it to an enormous scale, but they did not originally invent it.

Q   Flue-cured tobacco became popular before it was ever used in cigarettes, didn't it?

A    Before it was ever used in cigarettes.  It was used in pipe tobacco, for example.  It's much more popular later with cigarettes.

Q    But it was popular for pipe tobacco, wasn't it?

A    It was used in pipe tobacco, yes.

with a cigarette made, for example, from a tobacco

leaf taken off a plant and rolled up, right?

A    Right.

Q   Sir, you are familiar with roll-your-own cigarettes, aren't you?

A    I am, yes.

Q   When we talk about roll-your-own cigarettes, it's a process by which a smoker takes a cigarette paper, puts some tobacco in it, rolls it for themselves and smokes it, right?

A    Yes.

Q   Sir, based upon your review of the historical record, you would agree that there is a scientific consensus that roll-your-own cigarettes are as dangerous as cigarettes made by R.J. Reynolds or any other manufactured cigarettes, correct?

A    Yeah, sure.  It doesn't matter who rolls it.  If the paper is the same, if the tobacco is the same, they're pretty much the same.

Q   Sir, you would agree that roll-your-own cigarettes are as addictive as cigarettes made by R.J. Reynolds or any of these other manufacturers, correct?

Page 5013 A    Sure.  As long as you're rolling flue-cured

high-sugar tobacco in traditional paper, there would

be no physical difference, so there can't really be a

medical difference.

Q    All right.  I told you we'd talk about nicotine manipulation.  A few questions about that. I want to make sure that the jury understands what you mean by that.

When you testified that the tobacco companies manipulate nicotine, you are not testifying that the companies are putting extra nicotine in the cigarettes, are you, sir?

A    No, not necessarily.  In other words, every cigarette has a specification for nicotine by milligrams in the rod, and if it differs -- and stipulated two decimal points, a typical cigarette will be 2.5 percent nicotine in the tobacco.  If a production run is too high, they will lower the nicotine.  If a production run -- falls below the spec, they will elevate the nicotine.  So they can control that very carefully to two decimal points. There's no point in adding nicotine.  They calibrate, they manipulate, but the plant has enough nicotine, they don't have to add any.

Q    When a cigarette is manufactured, if you

Page 5014 compare the same amount of tobacco in the

manufactured cigarette by weight to the same amount

of leaf by weight, in general the leaf would actually

contain more nicotine by weight than a manufactured

cigarette, correct?

A    Well, that's true.  But that's a little misleading simply because the most important determinant is which leaf you start with.  If you start from low leaves on the plant, there's a very low level of nicotine.  If you start with leaves very high on the plant, there's a very high level of nicotine, because the nicotine is produced naturally in the plant as a form of resistance to predation. It's a kind of natural insecticide.  So it differs by the plant.  So the selection of how much -- the governance of how much nicotine is in the plant is mainly at the level of leaf selection.

But it's true, as you say, once you chose the leaf, once you blend the leaf, it's true that in the manufacturing some of that nicotine is lost.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, let me ask you to first please confirm that I am handing you a transcript of the testimony that you gave in a case in West Virginia, this time on April 19th � excuse me, April 29, 2013.

A    Yes, it is.  Yes.  Good trial. Q    Again, you and I got to take a trip to West Virginia and did the same thing there, didn't we? A    We did.

Q    Let me ask you to turn to page 1215, lines 4 through 8.

A    Yes, I've got it.

MR. GDANSKI:  One second.  Four through 8? MR. FURR:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I object.  It's not the question that's pending.

MR. FURR:  May I proceed, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Yes. Overruled. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, were you asked this question and did you give this answer in your sworn testimony in the West Virginia trial?

during the course of the manufacturing; the amount of

nicotine is reduced?

Answer:  Typically; typically.

Did I read that correctly?

A    Yeah; that's what I've just said. Q    Dr. Proctor; based upon your review of the historical record; would you agree that a safer cigarette has no real impact if smokers won't switch from the product they are currently smoking and use the safer product instead?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Speculative. MR. FURR:  I can ask the question differently; if you want me to. Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Rephrase the question. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor; wouldn't you agree; if a manufacturer were successful in making a safer cigarette that sat on the shelf and nobody bought it; it wouldn't do anything to improve public health? MR. GDANSKI:  I object; Judge.  It's speculative and assumes that it's not the only cigarette being sold.  I object. THE COURT:  Overruled.

definition. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Okay.  You mentioned this a couple times, sir.  Wouldn't you agree that the historical record demonstrates that the tobacco companies have tried to make a cigarette that was less hazardous?

A    Yes.  There have been many efforts along those lines within certain confines.

Q    We're going to talk about some of those. In fact, sir, would you agree that the tobacco industry has spent what you described as a fortune trying to make cigarettes less hazardous?

A    Yes, within limits.  In other words, they put catalysts that would destroy the polycyclics. They've made some cigarettes noninhalable.  They've made cigarettes without nicotine.  They've made cigarettes that heat rather than burn tobacco.  You could probably list 50 or 100 different types of efforts that have been made, but always within the confines of keeping the regular deadly ones on the market.  That's what they never did, they never took the truly deadly ones off the market.

Q    The tobacco industry, as you said, they have � you could probably identify 50 to 100 efforts

Page 5018 that have been made since the 1950s to try to make a

less hazardous cigarette, correct?

A    Yeah.  I, mean it's sort of like a car company that --

Q    I'm sorry, the only question is:  That's the number, that's been since the 1950s, right?

A    Yes.  I was explaining it's like if they're making a car with bad brakes and a car with good brakes and they never take off the market the car with bad brakes, they just tinker around with it.

Q    I think you made that point a couple times. Let's talk about some of the specific projects that the companies did, who did them, when they were done, what the goal was, and how much they cost.

A    Sure.

Q Sir, wouldn't you agree that R.J. Reynolds began in the 1950s trying to find ways to reduce the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?

A    Yes.

Q    That experimentation began in 1950s and continued all the way up to the 1980s, correct?

A    It did.

Q    The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are, in fact, an important class of carcinogens and it

Page 5019 would be a good thing if you could reduce the

delivery of those substances to a smoker, right?

A    Well, not necessarily.  It depends on what else you change.  If everything else were equal, that would be true.  The problem is, when you take one form of poison out, it usually means you have some other poison in greater proportion.  So the problem -- that's the general problem with monkeying around with the combustible product.  It usually ends up just as bad.  That's part of the problem.

Q    Let's talk about that and make sure we understand.  In your review of the historical record, you have seen the terminology "selective filtration," correct?

A    Yes, or selective reduction.

Q    By selective filtration or selective reduction the companies were referring to exactly what we're talking about, and that is efforts were made to find a way to essentially reach into the smoke and take out a certain compound or maybe even a category of compounds, right?

A    That's right.  It was a theory that in particular made sense in the 1950s, when there was the idea that maybe there was one, two or three things wrong with the cigarette chemically, and that

Page 5020 if you took that out, they would be completely safe.

That was E. Tyler Hammond's theory.  It was actually

many people's theory.  That turned out to be false

because there are too many chemicals to take out.  In

a way, it's all bad, so you can't collectively filter

just the bad stuff out.

Q    Well said.

In fact, one of the things they found out, as you alluded to, was that sometimes when you reduce one category of carcinogens, the smoke would be altered in a way that caused another category of carcinogens to increase, correct?

A    That's right.  Very early on in analysis of smoke, they over simplified how smoke was.  It turns out that smoke is complex chemically, and you can't make a clean smoke that involves burning organic material.

Q    Is the burning of organic material, the combustion process of tobacco that is the essential problem?

A    Correct.  That's an essential problem. There's two others.  One is addiction, which has nothing to do with combustion.  The other is inhalability, which has to do with smoke pH, which is governed by the sugar level in the tobacco.  So those

Page 5021 are the two principal problems:  The combustion, the

inhalability, and the addiction.

Q    By "combustion," we mean burning tobacco,

right ?

A    Right.

Q    There's another important class of compounds in cigarettes called nitrosamines, right?

A    Yes.  Yes.

Q    Nitrosamines are another class of carcinogens, right ?

A    Yes.  They're much more potent even than the polycyclics.

Q   Wouldn't you agree that the tobacco companies have tried to take out or reduce the nitrosamines from cigarette smoke?

A    Yes.  Well, in particular, in the 1980s and '90s, there was an effort by Reynolds to redo the curing process to remove one particular source of tobacco-specific nitrosamines involved in the direct propane curing of leaves.  Reynolds discovered this problem, which was produced by the direct contact of propane emissions with the tobacco, producing these nitrosamines and actually corrected most of that problem.

Q    What Reynolds found was that farmers had

Page 5022 begun using propane as the fuel source to generate

the heat to accelerate the drying process, right?

A    Right.  Not just propane, but propane in an open room.  Like if the tobacco was hanging here, you'd have the propane in the actual room and the fumes of that were interacting with the leaf, as opposed to the flue curing, where the fumes were kept separate from the leaf.

Q    As a result of the manner in which the farmers were exposing the leaf to propane, R.J. Reynolds discovered that the nitrosamines content of the leaf was actually being increased, right?

A    Correct.

Q    R.J. Reynolds took that information and published it in scientific readings, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    R.J. Reynolds shared that information with their competitors, like Philip Morris, so the other tobacco companies would know what was going on with the propane-cured tobacco, right?

A    That's right.  Without ever actually admitting that it caused harm, they, nonetheless, took steps to correct the problem.

Q    And in terms of taking steps to correct the problem, one of the things that R.J. Reynolds did and

MR. FURR:  On direct examination Mr. Gdanski elicited testimony from this witness about efforts by the companies to make safer cigarettes.  He introduced that topic on direct examination.  All I'm doing is fleshing out some of the details because Dr. Proctor, under Mr. Gdanski's questioning, told this jury that the tobacco companies tried to make cigarettes safer and it spent a fortune doing so.  He told them that on direct.

THE COURT:  So he is responding to your direct as opposed to mitigation?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  This is just clear evidence of the fact that they have done some good things and when they think things are bad they share it with the public and competitors.

A    Correct.

Q Yesterday you and Mr. Gdanski discussed research being done for Brown & Williamson by the Battelle Corporation.

THE COURT:  Why don't you let him finish his question first.  Remember, I told you guys, I just don't understand why we keep doing it. By you standing up, the witness was already instructed, right?

Witness, how many times did I tell you that when the lawyer stands up, that means that there's an objection, you don't answer, right?

THE WITNESS:  I didn't answer.

THE COURT:  Right.  So you know that already.

THE WITNESS:  I know it.

THE COURT:  You saw him standing up.  You knew that.  That's enough.  You don't need to interrupt him.  Let him finish his question.  He knows you're going to object.  He's not going to answer.  And then you make your objection.  So let's do it that way from now on.  Let him

objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I've heard the

question.

THE COURT:  I didn't hear the question.

You said six times "object" in the middle of his

question.  Let me hear the question.

BY MR. FURR:

Q    As you've just referred to in your last

answer, one of the efforts made to make a safer

cigarette was to develop cigarette products that

heated tobacco, but did not burn tobacco, like the

Premiere and Eclipse cigarette products developed by

R.J. Reynolds, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let's approach.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  I like that.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

THE COURT:  All right.  The nature of the

objection?

MR. GDANSKI:  The nature of the objection

is that it's, number one, outside the scope;

number two, Premiere and Eclipse are not

products made by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

THE COURT:  Let me go ahead and send the jury for a recess.  Don't talk about the case. Don't do any independent investigation.  Don't communicate with each other.  And don't use any electronic devices about the case. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  You can go use the restroom, Dr. Proctor.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ready guys?

MR. GDANSKI:  Are we taking a break?

THE COURT:  No, we're doing the objection right now.

MR. FURR:  I think it might be withdrawn.

MR. GDANSKI:  If he's going to stick to Premiere and Eclipse, which are made by Reynolds --

THE COURT:  I know, but I really would prefer to hear the full question, and then the objection.  If you stand up, he knows.  The witness has been told several times.

MR. GDANSKI:  I suppose, for the benefit of the Court.  It's problematic with me because we've tried many cases together, obviously as the jury can tell or Your Honor can tell. Sometimes one side or the other knows that something they fear inappropriate is going to come out of the lawyer's mouth and I don't know how else to do it.

THE COURT: If it comes out of the lawyer's mouth, it's not evidence. It's only evidence if it comes out of the witness' mouth.

CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. FURR:

Q    Dr. Proctor, when we broke, we were talking about efforts made by the tobacco companies to make a safer or less hazardous cigarette, correct? A    Yes.

Q    I want to talk to you about one specific effort by R.J. Reynolds, which was the effort made by R.J. Reynolds to develop a cigarette that heated, but did not burn the tobacco, okay? A    Yes.

Q    You're familiar with that effort, aren't you?

A    I am.

Page 5037 Q   That was an effort related to the

development of the Premiere cigarette, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   That effort lasted for about a decade, correct?

A    It did.

Q    From the early 1980s to about the early 1990s, right?

A    Yes.

Q    The whole idea behind that product was that the smoke would be less harmful if you just heated it instead of burning it because you would avoid the combustion process, right?

A    With the tobacco, yes.  Most of the poisons come from the combustion, and if you could just heat it, rather than burn it, you would eliminate much of the cancer harm.

Q   You would essentially decrease a lot of the tar, correct?

A    Well, you would simplify the emission in a way that would not have those complex organic combustion products that cause cancer.

Q    Sir, you are aware, aren't you, that R.J. Reynolds spent about a billion dollars trying to develop the Premiere cigarette?

Q    During the time that R.J. Reynolds was

developing the Premiere cigarette, that effort was

led by the head of research named Dr. DiMarco,

correct?

A    Yes, I believe so.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I have an objection. May I approach for a brief moment?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, now that I see where this is going, just like lights and low tars are cigarettes never smoked by Mr. Shulman.  Your Honor kept that out.  Obviously we would ask Your Honor to reconsider that.

Premiere and Eclipse are versions of heat no burn cigarettes that were never smoked by Mr. Shulman.  How is this any different than the argument that we made?  We asked for the inclusion of lights and low tars.  You said no, they've never smoked them.  They've now opened the door to versions and brands of cigarettes that he never smoked.

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, Mr. Gdanski can't

through it, claim that I opened the door.  He

can't get up on direct examination and have this

witness testify that the companies tried to

develop less hazardous cigarettes, none of which

Mr. Shulman ever smoked.  He can't do that and

then claim that I can't follow up on it without

opening the door.  That's not the way it works.

THE COURT:  Was there direct examination on these specific brands?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. FURR:  There was direct examination on this type of technology, on the predecessor product of this, on the aerial product from Brown & Williamson.  He's already testified to that.  That was the predecessor product that set this IBF into motion and this was a follow-up on that project.  So yes, he opened the door.

MR. GDANSKI:  I never asked him � in the same way that I was able to ask him about general ideas of tar and nicotine, but not specifically light and low tar, I asked about general ideas upon production, but there was no discussion about these specific brands of cigarettes.  Now Mr. Furr is asking about

the same logic.  It's all one big discussion

about cigarettes and I should be permitted to

ask him about lights and low tars.  They can't

crack open the door a little now by asking about

something that Mr. Shulman never smoked, and

then object to me asking about lights and low

tars on the basis that it is something that

Mr. Shulman never smoked.

THE COURT:  We are going to take up lights and low tars tomorrow morning and have a discussion on it, so why don't we defer on this and then you can revisit this question --

MR. FURR:  This is different, Your Honor, in that the way I got into this topic was I referenced the explicit discussion that Mr. Gdanski had with the witness about the Battelle documents and the documents reflecting the efforts by Brown & Williamson to develop the aerial cigarette product that contained nicotine, but no tar.  This Premiere and Eclipse development is an extension of that idea.

So he can't talk about efforts to do that, and then -- none of which Mr. Shulman smoked, and then preclude me from talking about the same

MR. GDANSKI:  When I wanted to talk about putting a novelty in the filler, and I said it was linked to a cigarette that came out 30 years later, that's what they're talking about now. They're talking about research done in 1963 as a predecessor to a research -- to a cigarette that came out 30 years later as well.  It's the same exact argument that they tried to use to block me.

THE COURT:  Why can't you cover this � are you guys saying that this witness is not coming back tomorrow?

MR. GDANSKI: I don't know what � the expectation was not. I don't know where we stand.

THE COURT:  Is he available to come back tomorrow?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know anymore.  That would be the seventh day.  That's not such a simple question, given where we are in the flow of the trial.  I mean I'm happy to -- I guess � I don't know.  Sure.  Maybe.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. GDANSKI:  He can maybe come back

MR. BRENNER:  They spent five days on

direct, by their own admission, trying not at

all to link anything to Mr. Shulman.  That was

the whole purpose of the direct.  Mr. Gdanski

made it very clear I'm not linking it to Mr.

Shulman.

I don't understand the objection at all.

For example, so we can skip the sidebar, I'm

going to get up when I do my examination and

talk about another product because Mr. Gdanski

elicited from Dr. Proctor that the tobacco

companies tried to keep nicotine at certain

levels and I'm going to introduce evidence of a

cigarette that didn't, which is directly

responsive.

THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the

objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think it opens the door.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

Q    All right.  Dr. Proctor, I'm not sure what

the last question was, so let me back up.

Page 5043 cigarette called the Premiere cigarette, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   And you are aware that R.J. Reynolds spent about a billion dollars trying to develop potentially safer heat but not burn cigarettes, correct?

A    Yes, that's correct.

Q   And the head of research at R.J. Reynolds during those efforts was Dr. DiMarco, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    In fact, Dr. DiMarco himself headed up the development of Premiere, right?

A    He did.

Q   Sir, one of the goals of the Premiere cigarette development project was to develop a less mutagenic cigarette, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   Because a less mutagenic cigarette may be less carcinogenic or less cancer causing, correct?

A    In principle, that's correct.

Q   During this development of the Premiere cigarettes, R.J. Reynolds extensively, extensively tested the product and the smoke and the components of the product, correct?

A    They did.

Q    In fact, R.J. Reynolds published a 744-page

Page 5044 monograph in which it described the testing that had

been done on the Premiere cigarette, correct?

A    That's true, but nowhere in that 700-page book did they say these were safer.  They couldn't, given the conspiracy to conceal, which would have � if they would have said that Premiere were safer, it would imply that the others were unsafe, and that's why they couldn't even be honest in that book.

Q    R.J. Reynolds would have gotten sued for making that representation?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  That's improper. Argumentative.  Speculative. MR. FURR:  Right. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. FURR:

Q    You know that R.J. Reynolds got sued over the Premiere cigarette for making representations about it being a cleaner smoke, right?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object, Judge. THE COURT:  What's the objection? MR. GDANSKI:  I object to relevance. THE COURT:  Relevance. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's true.  It would have meant the end of the conspiracy, though.  You

Page 5045 know, it would have been the entire end of the

conspiracy if they would have actually said that

some cigarettes were unsafe. BY MR. FURR:

Q    Back to my question then.  In that 744-page monograph, R.J. Reynolds presented the extensive testing that had been done on the Premiere cigarettes, its components and the smoke produced by that product, correct?

A    That's true.

Q   That monograph was made available to the Public Health Community, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Isn't it true that that monograph contained test results that compared the mutagenicity of Premiere to conventional cigarettes?

A    It did.

Q    And Premiere was less mutagenic than conventional cigarettes, correct?

A    It was.

Q    And the historical record demonstrates that Premiere was less risky in terms of lung cancer than the conventional cigarettes, correct?

A    Yeah, I agree.  And, again, they couldn't say that given the conspiracy.

Page 5046 Q    Premiere was put on test markets in 1988,

right ?

A    Yes.

Q    It failed in those test markets didn't, it?

A    Yes, it tasted fishy, like burned rubber. It didn't have a good taste.

Q    It wasn't bought because people didn't like the way it tasted or smelled, right?

A    Well, that was one reason.  The second reason is the company could not be honest about it actually being safer, given the conspiracy to conceal.

Q    And because the company would have gotten sued, right?

A    Well, that's possible.  I mean, that I think � that part is a little more speculative.

Q    You also know, sir, that when the Premiere cigarette was put on the market, that it was attacked by the Public Health Community, right?

A    Some in the community, yes.

Q    When the Premiere cigarette failed in the marketplace, R.J. Reynolds took it back in-house, spent hundreds of millions of more dollars and reintroduced it as a second generation heat but not burn cigarette called the Eclipse cigarette, correct?

Page 5047 A    Yes.  That burned a little bit of tobacco

to improve the flavor.

Q    Sir, you would agree that the historical scientific record demonstrates that the Eclipse cigarette is less harmful than traditional tobacco burning cigarettes?

A    Certainly with regard to cancer, that's true .

Q    But Eclipse has also failed in the marketplace, hadn't it?

A    Yes.  It suffered the same problems, given the ongoing agreement to conceal.

Q    Sir, during the course of your testimony with Mr. Gdanski, you mentioned a couple times that the highest fraction of youth smoking occurred in this country in 1997, right?

A    The highest prevalence, yes.

Q    The highest prevalence.

A    Yes.

Q    In the 18 years since 1997, the prevalence of youth smoking has dropped significantly in this count ry, hadn't it ?

A    It has.

Q    In fact, to use your words, it has plummeted, hasn't it?

Q   Would you agree that cigarette use by junior high and high school students is down by at least 66 percent since 1996?

A    I think that sounds right.

Q   Would you agree that � we looked earlier at how the prevalence of smoking was decreasing among adults, correct?

A    Yes.

Q   Wouldn't you agree that the prevalence of smoking is decreasing among youth even faster than among adults?

A    I think that sounds right, yeah.  There are fewer young people taking up the habit.

Q And that's because, to use your words, there has been a de-normalization of tobacco use among youth, correct?

A    That's right.  It's no longer as cool, as glamorous, as sexy.

Q Not only is it not cool, it has become stigmatized to smoke?

A    More stigmatized.  You still have Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley and half of every movie star smoking, but it's not as cool as it used to be.

7
	
	Again, you mentioned some of this so I'll

	compensated for your time, don't you, sir?
	
10
	A
	I do.

11
	Q

12
	you're being paid $6,000 a day for your time during

A    Yes.

Q    In 2013, you made about $430,000 testifying in this litigation, right?

A    That's right.

Q    Last year you made nearly $700,000 testifying in this litigation; is that correct?

A    It is.

Q    And you're well on your way to exceeding that this year, aren't you?

A    Yes.

Q    In fact, as of the Robertson trial a couple weeks ago, you had already made at least $600,000 this year working on this litigation, right?

A    That's right.

Q    And with this trial, you're well on your way to reaching $700,000, right?

A    Yes.

Q So sir, if my math is correct, you have made close to $2.5 million in the past five years providing testimony in these types of cases, right?

A    That's correct.

MR. FURR:  Thank you very much for your

counsel, ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

Q    Bad news.  Big book.

A    Looks thick.

Q    Good news is he covered most of it.  Let's

see if we can work our way through this.

I first want to start talking to you about

filtered cigarettes and unfiltered cigarettes, okay?

A    Yes.

Q    This whole section, if you feel that you

need to go beyond talking about filtered or

unfiltered cigarettes, you let me know and we'll

address it with the Judge, okay?  My questions are

going to be strictly limited to filtered versus

unfiltered.

A    Okay.

Q    Dr. Proctor, you would agree that in 1950

Page 5053 almost the entire cigarette market in the United

States was unfiltered cigarettes?

A    Yes, it was about 99 percent. Q    Starting in the '50s, some leading public health researchers such as the Surgeon General, Lawrence Wynder, and some other leading figures � let me rephrase that.

In 1950s some leading public health researchers, some we talked about, Lawrence Wynder, Drs. Hammond and Horn, a number of other leading figures started endorsing filters as a potential benefit over regular cigarettes?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Hearsay. MR. BRENNER:  It goes to notice, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, some in the Public Health Community started endorsing filters. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    In the mid-1950s you start seeing an uptick in filtered cigarette sales, correct?

A    Actually, much earlier.  I mean already shortly after 1950.

Q    Okay.  In fact, the sales of filtered cigarettes nearly doubled between 1954 and 1955

Page 5054 alone, correct?

A    That's right.  Especially after the Wynder and Graham experiments were publicized, there's a big shift to filters.

Q   Right.  You spoke a lot about that with Mr. Gdanski and Mr. Furr.  I'm not going to rehearse that with you.

In fact, at this time, Marlboro came out with a filtered cigarette in 1955, right?

A    Correct.

Q   By 1960, about half of all smokers were now smoking filtered cigarettes, correct?

A    Correct.

Q   And in � by 1964, which is when the � we don't have that timeline up anymore � the Surgeon General's report, which you discussed, the filter market was up to 61 � about 61 percent?

A    That's right.

Q   And then by 1970, the total filtered market, that means the percentage of filtered cigarettes versus unfiltered, was approximately 79 point � about 80 percent of the market?

A    Right.

Q   Okay.  Now I want to talk to you a little bit about the information that people, and cigarette

cigarettes, okay?

A    Okay.

Q We discussed this a little bit before. The Reader's Digest was one of the most popular magazines in the United States, correct?

A    Correct.

Q   From the 1920s, all the way up to the 1960s, the Reader's Digest was subscribed to by about 25 percent of the households?

A    Roughly.

Q The publishers, I think we talked about it, of the Reader's Digest were very antitobacco?

A    Right.

Q   They didn't take tobacco or cigarette advertising?

A    No.

Q   The Reader's Digest actually endorsed filtered cigarettes as a safer cigarette, did they not?

A    In the '50s, they did.

Q   In fact, you believe that that was one of the reasons that filtered cigarettes became so popular was because of the endorsement from Reader's Digest?

That's true

Q I think you've said it many times, you don't know if Mr. Shulman subscribed to Reader's Digest, correct?

A    I don't know.

Q    In addition to Reader's Digest, in the '50s, a number of public health groups endorsed filtered cigarettes as a better alternative?

A    Yes, some did.

Q    And a number of antitobacco groups as well did the same thing?

A    Yes, like Reader's Digest.

Q    It's also true in the 1960s, it was basically a common message from the Public Health Community that filtered cigarettes were a safer alternative to nonfiltered cigarettes?

A    You often heard that.  Not all public health officials did.  For example, the Surgeon General, as we've seen through Harry Reasoner, he said there was no evidence they were any safer, but he didn't rule out the possibility in the future.

Q    Right.

At that point, in 1964, that was a � you don't dispute that it was a common message from the Public Health Community in the '60s that filtered

Page 5057 cigarettes were a safer alternative?

A    The way I would call it is a common misunderstanding or a misconception.

Q    It's true, during the 1970s, that common message continued from the Public Health Community that filtered cigarettes were a safer alternative to nonfiltered?

A    Yes.  Many public officials would say it's best not to smoke, but if you must smoke, smoke a filtered.

Q    You saw my next question.  That was exactly right.  That was the message, if you're going to continue to smoke � you shouldn't smoke, but if you're going to continue to smoke, you're better off smoking a filtered cigarette than a nonfiltered.

A    That's right.

Q    I want to talk to you a little bit about the basis for the recommendations to switch to filtered cigarettes that we just went through.  You would agree that epidemiology studies of smoking and health have formed a huge part of the scientific data that resulted in the modern understanding about the dangers of smoking?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  It's hearsay. THE COURT:  Does this go to notice?

	BY MR. BRENNER:

8
	Q    Based on your review of the historical

9
	record, do you agree that epidemiology has played a

10
	major role in the understanding of the dangers of

11
	smoking?

12
	A    Sure.  It's one of the four pillars of the

13
	consensus.

14
	Q    Right.  We discussed this a little bit

15
	already.  By epidemiology studies, it's actually

16
	they � they, whoever is doing the study, tracks

17
	actual people in this case who smoke and they see

18
	what diseases they do and don't develop?

19
	A    That's right.

20
	Q    They were lots of different types of

21
	epidemiology studies done, right?

22
	A    Yes.                                         !

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm going to object hearsay. THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    Based on the review of the historical record, you would agree with me that Public Health Community, who was doing these studies, were reporting �

MR. GDANSKI:  I still object. MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, it goes to notice.

MR. GDANSKI:  I disagree. THE COURT:  No.  It goes to notice. Overruled. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    It's true that 40 to 50 of these studies reported that people who smoked filtered cigarettes were less likely to get lung cancer then people who smoked unfiltered cigarettes?

A    Yes.  This early epidemiology was flawed. It's not correct until the year 2000.  But you're

interpretation of filters being safer.

Q   Right.  You gave that opinion on direct.  I think you said that was in 2001.

A    It's correct.  The mistake is corrected.

Q   Right.

So there's literally scores of these studies that are finding that filtered cigarettes posed less risk than nonfiltered cigarettes?  Forty to 50 � scores at least � it's two and a half scores, right?

A    Yes.

Q   These were studies done by scholars, like scholars at Stanford and other medical schools and public health researchers, right?

A    Right.

Q   These weren't studies done by the tobacco companies?

A    No.

Q   For example, you would agree that the American Cancer Society was a leading body formed to fight cancer in the '30s and '40s, was involved in funding research and issuing documents on these types of issues?

A    Yes.

Page 5062 Q    In fact, Dr. Hammond, we've seen, actually

talked about some of those studies and explained the

benefits of switching from unfiltered to filtered

cigarettes, right?

A    That's right.

Q    This message continued to be communicated by the American Cancer Society even after 1976, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    You agree that neither Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds ever made any public comment that filtered cigarettes are safe or safer, correct?

A    No, they couldn't.  The agreement to conceal required that they not say cigarettes caused any harm.  So of course they couldn't say filters were safer because that would imply non-filters were unsafe.

Q    So you agree with my statement that neither Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds ever made any public comment that filtered cigarettes were safe or safer, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  It's been asked and answered.

Page 5063 hint that they were safer.  They implied safety.

The very word "filter" implied safety. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    I understand.

A    There were various indirect ways, but you're correct, they never said those words "filters are safer"?

Q    The same is true for the Tobacco Institute, the TIRC, or the CTR, correct?

A    Correct.

Q    The warnings that Mr. Furr showed you, starting � first one was '66, right?

A    Sixty-six, correct.

Q    That was the caution one?

A    Yes.

Q    That same warning went on the cigarettes whether they were filtered or unfiltered, right?

A    Yes, that they may be hazardous.

Q    And that changed in 1970 to warning, correct?

A    Yes.

Q    Again, no different warning went on filtered versus unfiltered, correct?

A    It was always the same.

Page 5064 went through the warnings in '85.  They changed

again.  They were always � the warnings were the

same, filters versus unfiltered?

A    That's right.

Q    I want to switch topics on you.  I'm going to jump around being the end guy.  Maybe not the end, Ms. Ruiz will have some, but the end after six or seven days.  I'll hop to a different topic.

I want to talk to you a little bit about what you discussed with Mr. Gdanski on several different days, which is the use of ammonia in cigarettes.

A    Yes.

Q    I think sometimes you say ammonia and sometimes you say ammonia compounds, right?

A   Yes.  It was sometimes applied in a gaseous state, but commonly in a salt state that would volatilize upon burning.  But the net effect was the same whether you used urea, ammonium hydroxide.

Q    So I'm going to use the terms interchangeably if that's okay with you.

A    That's fine.  There are all different ways of ammoniating the smoke.

Q    It's true that some ammonia compounds occur nationally in tobacco, correct?

Page 5065 A    Yes.  In fact, it was viewed as an irritant

prior to the '60s.

Q    It's also true that some ammonia compounds

have been added in some brands of cigarettes, right?

A    Right.

Q    The fact that ammonia is used in tobacco in the added form has been public information for a long, long time, correct?

A    Well, it's not really widely publicized until the '90s.  Maybe that's what you mean by a long time.  That's when it became a sensation or a scandal.

Q    So would you describe 1990 as a long, long time?

A    That's why I was leaving it open to interpretation.  That's when it really becomes widely known.  There are some patents going back earlier for ammoniation in the '60s.  That's a longer time obviously.

A    Exactly.  Those are the first I know about.

Q    In particular, using it in reconstituted tobacco, which you talked about a little bit.

A    Exactly.  To release the pectins to allow the tobacco recon sheet to be more pliable and cuttable so it didn't crumble once you rolled it into the cigarettes.

Q    Now, you testified on direct examination with Mr. Gdanski, and I don't remember the day, but you said that adding ammonia to cigarettes or tobacco smoke, the words you used were "increases the potency" �

A    Yes.

Q    � of the nicotine.  I just want to explore what you mean and don't mean by that.

A    Right.

Q    Okay.  Now, when you say more potent, that ammonia makes it more potent, you're not saying it makes it more addictive, right?

A    Not inherently, no.  It would only make it more addictive if for some reason there was a small amount of nicotine in the rod.  In that case, the increasing potency by ammoniation could make it more addictive.  But if there was already sufficient

Page 5068 nicotine to create and sustain addiction, ammoniation

would not make it more addictive.  If there was a

large amount of nicotine in the cigarette,

ammoniated, it would make it less addictive because

it would make it too harsh.  So it depends entirely

on which level you're starting.

MR. BRENNER:  Let's get the Jordan trial

from July 21, please.

Mr. Gdanski would like to approach, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Day after day I was objected

to or it was objected to when I asked questions

about ammoniation as it relates to addiction.

Your Honor excluded that very testimony with

specificity.  Ammoniation and addiction in the

same sentence was not something I was not able

to say or explain the theory of.

They've just taken advantage of Your

Honor's order and moved in limine to exclude

something.  They kept objecting when I brought

it up, only to come out on cross and make a

point that they find to be favorable.

THE COURT:  So are you making an argument

MR. GDANSKI:  That goes without saying.  I think that that's obvious at this point.  More fundamentally, though, is the appropriateness of blocking me from doing it on direct.  Opening the door is something that exists � it's not this concept that exists �

THE COURT:  I can reopen your direct.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I can show you the transcript --

MR. GDANSKI:  My point is how could they have moved in limine, received an order, blocked on direct and then done it on cross?  It definitely opens the door.  That's number one, for sure.

Number two is I just object to that practice.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I could show it to you.  I don't think it's necessary.  I had this exact discussion with you at the bench.  I said to you because he's been allowed to testify it's more potent, I'm going to cross him that that doesn't mean more addictive.  You said that will be fine and Mr. Gdanski said that will open

when it happens.

THE COURT:  It seems that your follow-up questions actually did go to whether it was more addictive than not.

MR. BRENNER:  Well, no, because I am trying to get him to say when he says it's more potent, it's not more addictive.  You can't say to the jury --

THE COURT:  He is saying that it may be.

MR. BRENNER:  No, he's not.  I'm about to impeach him.  He's about to say it's not more addictive.

MR. GDANSKI:  He just said right now under certain circumstances it may be.

THE COURT:  But Mr. Gdanski is going to be allowed to ask questions on this.

MR. GDANSKI:  Then I would have done it on direct.

THE COURT:  You're going to do it on direct because there's going to be a new direct.

MR. GDANSKI:  When?

THE COURT:  I don't know when.  There's going to be, or at least the opportunity for it. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

Q    I've handed you your testimony from the Jordan trial on July 21, 2015?

A    Right.

Q    By the way, the last time we went through your testimony, that was also sworn testimony, right?

A    It was.

Q    Let me find the page for you.

I'm reading from page 2153, lines 19 to 22.

MR. GDANSKI:  Hang on a second.

MR. FURR:  Yeah.

THE WITNESS:  Right.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think this is absolutely consistent with his answer.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    You were asked the following question and gave the following answer.

Were you asked the following question and gave the following answer?

Question:  When you talk about it being more potent and having more kick and more impact, you said not more addictive, right?

Answer:  Not necessarily more addictive. A    Yeah.  That's exactly what I just said.

Page 5072 It's not inherently -- it doesn't make it inherently

more addictive.

Q    In fact � and you've just said it in your prior answer, in fact, you believe that adding ammonia to a traditional cigarette actually makes it less addictive?

A    It could, yeah.  If it's already harsh, in other words, according to the blend there's a certain smoke pH.

Q    Okay.

A If it's too harsh and you were to add ammonia, it would actually make it less addictive, which is exactly what pipe tobacco is. Pipes are less addictive because the smoke pH is so high, it has the same effect as if you ammoniated it, which makes it not appealable and less addictive because it's too harsh.

Q    So let's � instead of saying it could make it, let's see what you said in prior testimony.

MR. GDANSKI:  Argumentative. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    If you would go to 2145 of the same transcript �

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, I still object.

It's argumentative.  Commentary of counsel.

MR. GDANSKI:  Hold on.

MR. BRENNER:  2145, line 18 through the end of that answer, which is 24.

MR. GDANSKI: I think it's consistent with the answer that he gave. I think it's improper impeachment.

Page 5074 it out of the addictive sweet spot they always keep

it in.  They always keep it in a pH 5 to about 6.5

range.

Did I read that correctly?

A    Yeah.  That's exactly what I said.  If you were to add it to a cigarette already with a high smoke pH, it would � it could make it less addictive.

Q    So let's see if we could crystalize this a bit.  We just talked about some cigarettes having ammonia and some don't, right?

A    Yes, added ammonia.  They all have some ammonia just from the natural decay and fermentation of the plant.

Q    You're absolutely right.

So, for example, the Lucky Strike brand of cigarettes in 1946 did not have added ammonia, correct?

A   No.  There's no cigarette that had added ammonia until Marlboro in the early 1960s.

Q    So Lucky brand 1946 no added ammonia?

A    No.

Q    No meaning yes, right?

A    Pardon me?

Q    Meaning yes, you agree with me?

Page 5075 A    Yes, I agree with you.

Q    And the Marlboro brand, as you mentioned,

the Marlboro brand in 1972 did have added ammonia?

A    Yes.

Q    You would agree that the smoke from that 194 6 Lucky Strike cigarette without ammonia is no less addictive than a 1972 Marlboro with ammonia?

A    In principle, that's true.

Q    Based upon your historical research into the tobacco company's documents and materials and your scientific research in the area, you agree that the tobacco companies were not attempting to design or develop a cigarette that was more addictive than it had been already, correct?

A    I think that's generally true.  I do think they were being deceptive about the machine measured yields of nicotine.  In other words, they were advertising certain cigarettes as being low nicotine when, in fact, they were not low nicotine because of ammoniation.  So it's � you're correct in what you said, but there's also a little twist that needs to be put in there.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I'd move to

strike everything beyond "correct."

THE COURT:  I'll deny the motion to strike. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    In fact, Dr. Proctor, you're aware of no internal Philip Morris document which states, we must add additive X for the purpose of making cigarettes more difficult to quit, correct?

A    Yeah, they would not have said that.

Q    The same is true for the other tobacco companies, correct ?

A    That's right.  They do use language like, determine the minimum nicotine to keep smokers hooked, but they don't do exactly the language --

Q   We'11 get to that because you did talk about that on direct.

A    Yes.

Q    But you agree with me, with my statement that you won't find documents that say, we must add an additive, a particular additive for the purpose of making cigarettes more difficult to quit?

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  Asked and

answered. BY MR. BRENNER:

then he's assembling the list out of them.

Q    In fact, the � one of his main sources is the US Public Health Service, right, Number 2?

Q    You've never found an instance where Philip Morris said publicly that Marlboros are healthy, correct?

A    No, they never said that.

Q Or that they're safer than any other brand, correct?

A    No.  There are intimations of safety, but

A    Correct.

Q    In fact, in your review of advertising for Marlboro, none of those ads use the words "safe" or "safer," correct?

Q    Okay.  One last topic.  Believe it or not, one of the first things you said � I won't put you to a memory test, but one of the first questions you were asked when you were giving your background is, you described yourself as a student of the history of science and you studied the history of disease and what causes and leads to disease?

MR. BRENNER:  In that case I move for sanctions.

MR. GDANSKI:  I know what they are because I know what you're doing.

THE COURT:  As part (sic) time of that study, you were very familiar with the kind of symptoms that people who have COPD report based on your historical research?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's the question.  So my objection is, Judge, is that Dr. Proctor is not here as a medical doctor.  He's not a medical doctor.  Symptoms of COPD, Mr. Brenner is trying to make the point that if someone doesn't have certain symptoms, they probably don't have COPD, and that is clear medical testimony.  You can have COPD and be asymptomatic.  You can have COPD and be highly symptomatic.

THE COURT:  I believe, Mr. Brenner, there were objections on your team or not -- maybe not your side but maybe some of the co-defendants on issues that dealt with medical type testimony that I sustained.

MR. BRENNER:  By Dr. Proctor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Right.  But there were objections about medical stuff.  Here you're asking about symptoms.

MR. BRENNER:  I'm not asking about Mr. Shulman's symptoms.

THE COURT:  You're asking him about medical symptoms.  That's something that a doctor does. Rephrase your question I guess in a way that --

MR. BRENNER:  I asked it based on his historical research, does he know the common symptoms of COPD?

THE COURT:  The common symptoms are something that a doctor testifies about.  If you want to ask him other questions about COPD, but not symptoms.

MR. BRENNER:  I just want to ask him two questions.  He has testified on this in the past.  Your Honor, here is the point �

THE COURT:  Did he testify on direct about the symptoms?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. BRENNER:  No, he testified that he is,

THE COURT:  You can ask him other questions about COPD.

MR. BRENNER:  Can I make my record?  I wanted to say why I'm asking the questions.  He described himself as, he has studied the history of disease and what causes and what leads to disease.  How can I not ask him about one of the number one related smoking disease?

THE COURT:  But you're asking him about a symptom of it.  You can ask about COPD.

We' ve

Q    Good afternoon, Dr. Proctor.

A    Good afternoon.  Nice to see you.

Q    Nice to see you again.

I'm Maria Ruiz, I represent Liggett met a few times in these trials, right?

A    We have.

Q    A couple questions for you.  Forgive me, I have a cold.

You'd agree with me that since the 1950s Liggett has conducted itself differently than the rest of the industry, right?

A    That's true in certain respects.

Q
	You talked about the Plaza Hotel meeting

during your direct examination.  I don't think it was
	
pointed out, but just confirm for me, Liggett was not
	
at that Plaza Hotel meeting, right?
	
A
	They were not.  They were the only major

cigarette
	manufacturer that decided not to attend the

Plaza Hot
	el, and, therefore, were not part of the

original
	conspiracy.                                   ij

Q
	And as you said, the Frank Statement was

borne out
	of that meeting, right?

A
	Yes.                                         1

Q
	Liggett did not sign on to the Frank

Statement
	?

A
	They did not.

Q
	Liggett's name does not appear anywhere on

that document, right?
	
A
	That's true.

Q
	Liggett did not retain Hill & Knowlton?

A
	That's true.

Q
	Liggett was never a member of the

organizat
	ion TIRC when it was known by that name,

right ?
	

A
	That's right.  They only joined when it had

the new name Council for Tobacco Research.
	
Q
	Right.  We'11 talk about that in a second.

1
	Liggett wasn't involved in the TIRC's

2
	formation?

3
	A    Correct.

4
	Q    Liggett was a member of the CTR for about

5
	four years, a little less than four years?

6
	A    That's right.

7
	Q    The CTR existed from 1953 to about 1999?

8
	A    Yes.                                         i

9
	Q    Liggett joined in 1964?

	Q         And resigned in January of 1968, right?

12
	A    Correct.

13
	Q    Now, you wouldn't dispute the Liggett's

14
	contributions to CTR's general fund was .15 percent,

15
	right?

16
	A    Yes, in other words, the financial

17
	contribution of Liggett was dwarfed by that of the

18
	other manufacturers.

19
	Q    And its contributions to the CTR special

20
	projects fund was .79 percent, right?

21
	A    Yes, much less than 1 percent.

22
	Q   Now, you talked about the Tobacco

23
	Institute �

	A    Yes.                                         1

Page 5090 That was funded by 12 member organizations?

A    Yes.

Q    Just about all of the big players in the tobacco industry were involved in the Tobacco Institute, right?

A    Yes, I think nearly all of them.

Q    That includes tobacco growers?

A    Yes.

Q    Merchant associations?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, a significant amount of money was contributed by the industry to fund the Tobacco Institute over time, right?

A    Yes.  That's the only funder of the institute was the industry.

Q    Right.  But Liggett's contributions was only .3 percent, right?

A    Correct.  It was small.

Q    So instead of joining the TIRC, Liggett had its own independent response to the cancer risk information that was coming out in the early 1950s?

A    Yes, they hired Arthur D. Little to do certain mouse painting experiments.

Q    Right.  We'11 get to that in a second.  It included a large-scale investment in biological and

9
	Q
	You talked about Arthur D. Little?

	A
	Yes.                                       I

Page 5093 Liggett also hired Arthur D. Little to

perform fractionization analysis to study what

specifically might be in cigarettes that could be

causing cancer, right?

A    Correct, much like Rodgman at Reynolds and Wakeham and so forth.

Q    Liggett and Arthur D. Little told people from the American Cancer Society about their research in the 1950s, right?

Q    They coordinated with Dr. Wynder?

A

Yes

Q    � over the years?

Now, it contains reports concerning carcinogens in cigarettes smoke, right?

A    It does.

Q    It reveals the presence of benzoapyrene in cigarette smoke?

A    It does.

Q    It reveals the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, the nine-volume submission is dated April 1963?

A    Yes.

Q    That's before the publication of the Surgeon General's report?

A    That's right.

Q    Liggett also gave an oral presentation to the committee?

A    Yes, but just to complete that answer, they never actually said cigarettes cause cancer in that giant set of papers.

Q    Well, that will be in evidence.  The jury can see for itself what's in there.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's just argumentative.  I

THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MS. RUIZ:

Q   The Surgeon General's committee acknowledged Liggett in the Surgeon General's report, right ?

A    Yes.

Q   Now, if you look at the next document I've handed you, Liggett Exhibit 219, that's a 1963 letter from Dr. Hundley to Dr. Kensler.  You've seen that document before?

A    Yes, I have.

Q   Dr. Hundley at the Surgeon General's department expressed that Simple acknowledgment of the report in the nine volumes which was submitted is not sufficient.  Please accept on behalf of Liggett and Myers our special gratitude for the tremendous time, effort, and expense in the production of this material for our use.

Is that right?

A    That's a quote, yes.

Q   And they go on to say that they are especially grateful for the most excellent oral presentation made by you and Dr. Raymond on May 3rd?

Q
	All right.  The next document is Liggett

Exhibit
	217.  You've seen that document before?

A
	I have.

Q
	That's a telegraph from Liggett's president

Zack Toms to � from Liggett's president Zack Toms to
	
the Surgeon General, Dr. Terry.  Do you recognize
	
that?
	

A
	I do.

Q
	Now, that is dated just three days after

the Surgeon General's report comes out, right?
	
A
	Yes.                                         1

Q
	And in that telegram Mr. Toms is expressing

to the
	Surgeon General that its researchers would be

made available to the public health community for
	
further
	research, right?

A
	That's what it says.

Q
	That document appears to have gone straight

to the
	Surgeon General?

A
	Correct.

Q
	That wasn't some secret message.

A
	No.  It's a telegram.

Q
	All right.  The next document I'd like to

talk about is Liggett Exhibit 6965.  That's a
	
July 11th, 1966 document from the United States

A    It is.

Q   You've seen that document?

A    I have.

Q   The subject of the report of it is A Report of Trip to Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Massachusetts?

A    That's right.

Q   That trip was on July 7th, 1966, right?

A    It is.

Q   That states:  In view of the voluminous amount of material contained in the report, it would be impossible to report here the many findings obtained in a ten-year period of productive collaboration.

Is that right?

A    That's right, that's what it says.

Q   By 1966 Liggett had spent at least ten years doing scientific research and had been collaborating with the government, right?

A    That's true.

Q   The report goes on to state:  To the best of my knowledge, this was the only report prepared by industrial interests for the benefit of the Surgeon General's committee.

A    That's the word they use.  I'm just saying it's not just a collaboration.

Q    All right.  Well, the report goes on to phrase Arthur D. Little as being exceptionally well-qualified and equipped to undertake the biological evaluation of the activities of cigarettes smoke, condensate, fractions, and compounds, right?

A    Yes that's an actual quote.

Q    Right.  Now, you've not isolated Liggett out as a specific research target, right?

A    No.

Q    You're not aware of any evidence that Liggett engaged in a specific youth marketing campaign?

A    Well, I think all of the companies involved were involved in youth targeting, but I haven't researched specifically the Liggett youth targeting.

Q    You don't have any Liggett-specific evidence of targeting the youth market?

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I haven't isolated that out

as a research project. BY MS. RUIZ:

Q    Since the early 1980s Liggett shifted away from branded cigarettes to generic cigarettes, right?

A    They did, cheaper brands.

Q   And generic cigarettes, they compete based just on price?

A    It's price competitive, yes.  It's the cheapest type of cigarette.

Q So since the '80s Liggett hadn't used print advertising or marketing campaigns to brand products, right ?

A    I think that's correct.

Q    In 1980 Liggett cut its print and � print advertising and billboard advertising, right?

A    Yes.

Q    Now, you testified about the facts that for decades advertising expenditures for tobacco companies skyrocketed but you weren't referencing Liggett there, right?

A    No.  I was referencing the total budgets. Liggett dwindles, it becomes a marginal company.

Page 5101 Q    Right.  Liggett gets smaller over time and

its advertising expenditures were tiny compared to

everybody else's?

A    Yeah, it got sort of gobbled up by the other companies.

Q    By the 1970s Liggett's market share dropped precipitously, right?

A    It did.

Q    In fact, Liggett's market share had dropped to around 2 to 2 1/2 percent by the 1990s?

A    Yes, to 2 to what percent did you say?

Q    2 to 2 1/2 percent.

A    Yes.

Q    Is that right?

A    Yes.

Q Now, you talked about the tobacco companies being required to turn over their internal documents. Do you remember that?

A    Yes.

Q    Liggett was the first to do so and it turned over its documents voluntarily, right?

A They did. They were the earliest and the first, a year or two ahead of the others. And it's actually one of the things that cascaded and led to the eventual release of all of the documents that we

A    Yes.

MS. RUIZ:  Thank you.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, may we approach for one minute?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I'm asking your indulgence, I skipped a five-minute topic.  I need five more minutes of cross, I skipped a topic.  I need to do that.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't even know what to say.

THE COURT:  I'll reopen it. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BRENNER:

different products.  Do you remember that?

A    You can't take tar --

Q    You were talking about �

MR. GDANSKI:  He's answering the question. THE WITNESS:  You can't tar out of the

cigarette. BY MR. BRENNER:

Q    Right.

A    There's no tar in a cigarettes any more than there is ashes in wood.  Tar is just condensed smoke so let's start with that.

Q    A little switch in topic.  You agree that in the late 1980s or early 1990s Philip Morris actually tried to remove � virtually removed all of the nicotine from the tobacco and test marketed three brands of cigarettes?

A    Yes, that's correct.  The Next brand, that's capital N, Benson De-Nic and � sorry, Merit De-Nic and Benson & Hedges De-Nic all had 97 percent of the nicotine removed from the rod, which was a level sufficient so that it could not create or sustain addiction.

Q    How Philip Morris got there is they bought a company that made decaffeinated coffee, right?

A
	Yes.                                      1

Q
	Then they figured they could use the same

technology used to decaffeinate coffee to take
	
nicotine
	out of tobacco?

A
	That's right.

Q
	They made those three brands you just

talked about, right?
	
A
	They did.

Q
	As you said they were successful in

removing
	about 90 percent of the nicotine of the

tobacco?
	

A
	97.

Q
	97?

A
	They reduced it to a truly sub-addictive

level so
	they were truly safer cigarettes in the

sense of
	being not capable of creating or sustaining

addiction
	

Q
	They test marketed them in stores where

people buy cigarettes?
	
A
	Yes.                                         1

Q
	They were a big flop, right?

A
	That's right, yeah.  They couldn't honestly

advertise
	them as not addictive because they weren't

admitting
	that their regular cigarettes were

addictive
	So it's kind of a double binder.

Page 5105 Q    You believe that the Next cigarette, which

was one of the brands that you said was certainly

less addictive than traditional cigarettes, right?

A    It's not only less addictive, it was nonaddictive.  It could not create or sustain addiction, too little nicotine in the rod.

Q    In your review of tobacco company documents and in the scientific literature you have found no evidence indicating any concern on the part of Philip Morris that producing the Next cigarette was so low a percent of nicotine in the rod that it would result in a nonaddictive cigarette, correct?

A    That was kind of a long question.

Q    Sure.

You showed the jury a document that said, make sure to keep a minimum level to keep smokers hooked.  Remember that?

A    From the '60s.

Q    Right.  And you agree that Next was below that level?

A    Correct.

Q    And the other two brands were as well, correct?

A   Definitely, yes, they were truly nonaddictive cigarettes.

So before I take your redirect, I suppose I need to address that with regard to direct because then that may trigger questions on their part before you actually do redirect.  Do you understand what I'm saying?

opportunity.  And then there was the one where

you said he opened the door, which I guess we

could handle on redirect.

MR. GDANSKI:  Here is my observation.  For things that they opened the door to, I get to handle on a redirect, and they don't get another word.

MR. BRENNER:  That's not �

MR. GDANSKI:  That's my position.  So if they opened the door on cross, they covered it on cross, I get to do it on redirect, and they don't get recross on it.

But for lights and low tars, I think that's a separate issue because I didn't cover that on direct, even though we asked multiple times to. I do want to and I will and I can be prepared to, and then they would -- I know Mr. Brenner will ask for a cross on lights and low tars, and then I will have a redirect on lights and low tars .

THE COURT:  I'm not sure procedurally where it is and whether they get another bite of the apple or they don't get another bite of the apple.  It's something that you said that you

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.

THE COURT:  In any case, I'm going to send the jury for a break.  I'm going to give you guys a quick five-minute break so that you can use the restroom and then we'll come back and take some argument on this.

We're presumptively � when we get past this issue and you do your redirect, we're at a point where we can finally conclude a witness that has gone on for how many days now?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's true.  I was going to suggest to the Court, given the time, it's 5:50, I would just do my continued direct, my redirect, whatever we're calling it, tomorrow morning.  It's 5:50.  This is not going to be a simple process.

THE COURT:  No.  We're not doing that. We're going to finish tonight.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  We're going to take a five-minute break and come back and argue it

THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll take a five-minute recess. (Whereupon, a recess was taken at 6:06 p.m.)

THE BAILIFF:  Come to order.  Court is back in session.

THE COURT:  All right.  To the argument on the light and low tars again, regarding that.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, if I may, let me start by saying I was frustrated yesterday, and perhaps I shouldn't have let my frustration show when this came up.  But what's happened here --

THE COURT:  There's a lot of things that are frustrating when you are in litigation.

Page 5112 MR. BRENNER:  Sure, but I just wanted to

say that to the Court.

Your Honor, what happened yesterday was we had litigated this issue at least three or four times.  Then Ms. Humphries walked in, actually as the jury was about to walk in, and she raised an issue and the first words out of her mouth were -- she said to you that the Broward County court, Judge Murphy, had just agreed with her that in a case where a smoker is -- there's no evidence that the smoker smoked lights, that the evidence of lights and low tar did come in.

I've been the one to tell you all along, I think you should make your own call.  I still believe that.

One of the reasons it's so frustrating when a lawyer walks in with no notice and says something like that, I don't know, you probably think it's true, I think it's true, it's not true.  I go back to my office.  Within five minutes I pull the argument that Ms. Humphries so triumphantly said to you � by the way, she said -- not only did she say they agreed with her � so you know, Judge Murphy's order says the word "denied" on the motion in limine.  She

Page 5113 has no idea why Judge Murphy did what he did.

But here is what I do know.  In the title of the case � I'm guoting my colleague, Pete Hank, who is arguing the motion � the first thing he says to the Court, hey, this is a case where one of the friends apparently said she smoked them, lights, for some brief period of time in the '70s.

So immediately we know the Tognoli issue has nothing to do with what we're discussing. We're discussing a case where we have a smoker, which everyone agrees, never smoked a light or low tar cigarettes.  There's no dispute about that.

Then you said to me, well, Ms. Humphries raised a different argument yesterday.  I said to you, I don't think she did.  So I went back and looked at what you had before you made your first ruling.  And what I am going to was the voir dire of this witness.  Here was what Dr. Proctor was asked the first time we argued this :

public, would you need to explain the history of

It would be helpful.

We've already said that the filter story could go in.

Then he says:  Would you want to and would it be helpful to explain the marketing of lights, low tar, all natural, organic?  Is that necessary to explain the totality of the story as it relates to providing smokers doubt and a psychological crutch?

Dr. Proctor says it's important.  He's interested in the whole truth.  So they said you need to know because it's the same story as filters and low tar.

Then they voir dired him again.  Here is the voir dire.

Did the marketing of filtered cigarettes and cigarettes in general, filtered, unfiltered, lights, low tar, did all that take place in combination with each other as part of the fraud to reassure the public?

Well, sure.

And then he goes on where they say the

have the exact same argument.

Here is what you ruled the first time. Look, it comes -- it came upon you, as it came upon us, completely out of the blue.  Here is what you ruled the first time.

Nothing has changed.  There's no evidence that changed.  The facts are the same.  He didn't smoke lights.  And the voir dire is the same.  It's the same argument, all part of the same marketing fraud.

Here is what you ruled:

Well, no, I think I'm going to -- based on what I've heard and weighing everything from a 404 perspective, on prejudicial, the fact that there is no evidence that the smoker has or, in this case, involved low tars or -- what is it � low tars -- what is it?  Lights?

I informed you it's lights.

Lights -- you're back.  Lights and low tar cigarettes, and the witness, when he was voir dired, said there was no conspiracy --

Again, it didn't change.

� no evidence of any specific conspiracy to commit any fraud.  So there's very, very

said.  He throws in the word "fraud," but it

doesn't back it up with anything.

When he was examined by the defense, his answer were very inadequate on that topic.

And you ruled:  So I think that the prejudice and the confusion to the jury on the case is outweighed by any possible relevance. I'm going to exclude it.  I'm going to exclude low tars and lights.

So nothing changed.  The facts are the same.  The law is the same.  Nothing changed. You said to me I've got to be ready for a motion for reconsideration.  The standard on a motion for reconsideration is the facts changed, the law changed.  Neither happened.

And, Your Honor, I say to you sometimes, you have to understand the light story is a whole case.  I have explained that to you.  What I understand plaintiff is saying is the marketing is the same.

So if Plaintiff is saying, I want to put in some ads for a low tar cigarette, some print ads, that's apparently what they're saying is the same.  I still think it's completely

But I can assure you that's not what they want

to do.  I can assure you that's not what they

want to do.

Let me give you a taste of what the light story is so you can understand the prejudice and the disassociation from this case.  Here is the some of the light story.  Plaintiff had it on one of its demonstratives.

They claim that to make low tar cigarettes, one of the ways you do it is to put holes in the filter, ventilation holes, microscopic holes in the filter.  What will happen is when smokes comes in, air gets in, dilutes the smoke, lowers the tar and nicotine.

They will say, well, they put the holes in such a way that smokers will unconsciously cover the holes, thereby defeating the ventilation of the filter.

What in the world would that have to do with a case with a guy who didn't smoke light cigarettes or low tar cigarettes?  Nothing.

Here is another lights facts that the plaintiffs like to talk about.  Because of the way light cigarettes or low tar cigarettes are

They draw deeper and they reach a different

place in the lung, and they cause a different

kind of lung cancer.  Something called

adenocarcinoma.  There was a rise in

adenocarcinoma.  No doubt about it.

What in the world does that have to do with Mr. Shulman's case?  He didn't smoke lights, he doesn't have adenocarcinoma, he doesn't have lung cancer.

Your Honor, even their argument has nothing to do with what I suggest they're trying to do.

If they just want to throw in some ads, again, I think it's prejudicial, but � that's the only thing they're saying they want to do.

It's frustrating because nothing has changed.  The voir dire remained identical.  You made a ruling that it was both irrelevant, and to the extent it had any relevance, it was prejudicial.

Now, I guess -- that's why we didn't voir dire again, because we went back and looked and they did the same thing.  What we did on voir dire was got Dr. Proctor to establish they're two entirely different products.  He smoked one,

I guess the idea is � Your Honor, I'11 leave it at that.

Let me say one other thing.  Ms. Humphries' suggestion to you that this would be reversible error to cut off Dr. Proctor at only six days of testimony and not going into light cigarettes which the � lights or low tar cigarettes which the smoker did not smoke, is -- I would say it's not well founded.  I think there is no possibility that you would be committing error by saying that in a case where the smoker did not smoke light cigarettes, you can't put in evidence of light cigarettes.  I do think there's a substantial basis for prejudice, as you yourself have pointed out, and confusion and, therefore, error in allowing all of these collateral issues to come in in a case that has nothing to do with Mr. Shulman.

They keep saying it always come in.  It keeps in when people smoke lights.  My cases --my own experience, I'll tell you, is that when the person doesn't smoke lights, the Judge never hears about it.  That's my experience.  They didn't try to put it in.

Page 5120 I don't quarrel with the fact that they

want to.  That's their strategy.  My personal

experience is in cases -- that's why you don't

have a lot of rulings either way on it. I'll

leave it at that.  We think Your Honor's

original ruling, nothing has changed since you

MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you.  I don't really see it as � I think as being supremely overly complicated.  I think we've made an absolute --

THE COURT:  What type of evidence � how many questions would you be asking on this topic?

MR. GDANSKI:  Given the time of the night, it won't be what I would ordinarily do, that's for sure.  So probably about ten minutes on the topic.  That's my initial gut response. Depending on � there's some documents obviously that go to the issue, but it goes to the core

It goes to the same core issues.  It goes to the fraud.  There's a finding in this case that the tobacco companies committed fraud by concealment.  It's not that complicated.  Fraud by concealment.  So they concealed information and by virtue of concealing information committed a fraud.  It begs the question:  What information did they conceal?

Well, they concealed lots of different types of information about smoking causes disease, about nicotine being addictive, about lights not being any safer, about filters being --

THE COURT:  Tell me what you elicited from this witness when you redid voir dire that is any different than what was given before.  On the questions to your follow-up questions that you asked yesterday as well as today, tell me what the witness gave us that you didn't give us initially that leads me to want to look at this any differently.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll be perfectly honest with Your Honor, after the sidebars and the proffers and the voir dires, I can't from perfect memory

Page 5122 recall the differences between the first voir

dire, the second, the third and all of the other

questions I asked the witness over the course of

five days.

I know this is true, though.  This morning he testified that lights and low tars were outlawed because they were deemed to be fraudulent.  We have a lawsuit here for fraud. There's an Engle finding of fraud by concealment, that they omitted material information, not otherwise known to the public, and the public relied upon that to its detriment.  It's not that complicated of a link up.  They committed a conspiracy to commit fraud.

Dr. Proctor also testified today, by the way, that, but for that conspiracy, they would not have been able to continue to market any product, which obviously includes lights and low tars.  So you have the following testimony in the record:  No conspiracy, no marketing of light and low tars.  That in and of itself is sufficient reason for the introduction of light and low tar evidence.  You have the fact of a finding that they concealed information.  That

Page 5123 in itself begs the guestion of what they

concealed, lights and low tars.  You have

evidence from the witness that, as part of the

public health reassurance campaign and the

providing a psychological crutch, it existed in

multiple different facets and fashions, and

lights and low tars is one of them.  We have

evidence during the proffer that lights and low

tars were banned because they are fraudulent.

That's obviously important in the context of a case where the jury can consider reprehensibility.  It's not just harm to Mr. Shulman; it's harm to others as well. That's obviously something Your Honor has permitted.

All of that, all of it combined and individually goes in favor of admitting lights and low tars cigarettes.  There is an illusion of multiple different types of cigarettes, filtration, there is an illusion of lights and low tar cigarettes.  They continued to market light and low tar cigarettes.

On this whole cigarette machine, it's complicated, the cigarette machine.  I don't begin to understand it beyond its most

Page 5124 simplistic fashion.  But there was a cigarette

machine that existed before the introduction of

lights and low tar cigarettes.  Then lights and

low tar cigarettes are introduced and, of

course, that same cigarette machine is used to

measure the yields.

The companies, though, as part of their knowledge, their fraud, and conduct know that the machine, which may have existed for 50, 60, 70, or 100 years, they know that it is deceptively, not intentionally because it's a machine, but they know that it is incorrectly gathering the data about how a light and low tar cigarette is smoked.  With that knowledge that this machine is not actually gathering the appropriate number of the tar and nicotine yield in a cigarette, the company says, hey, let's keep using this machine because we know it is not correctly analyzing smoke, tar and nicotine numbers.

So with that they continued to advocate for the use of this machine, which it doesn't matter.  Your Honor was concerned when it came out, if it came out before or after, lights or low tars.  It doesn't make a difference.  While

And then, ultimately, the FTC, who was in charge of this machine measured system, comes out in 2008, I think, and says, hey, we're not going to be the smoke screen for your deceptive and fraudulent advertising campaigns for light and low tar.  Because the documents come out, the internal secret documents come out, which demonstrate that the industry knows the machine is being used in a deceptive fashion.  The FTC gets them, examines them, and says, whoa, we've been duped all these years.

That's all reprehensible.  It all goes to the fraud, it all goes to the conspiracy.  This is Florida law.  When you have a conspiracy, you don't excise out portions of a conspiracy.  If someone becomes a victim of a conspiracy ten years into its existence, you don't say, when they sue for that conspiracy, you can't talk about years one through ten.  It's the whole of the story that matters.

Page 5126 page 17 in the Surgeon General's report.  It

talks about the fact that the tobacco

industry -- talks about the fact that the Public

Health Community recommended, in contrast to

industry awareness, so in contrast to what the

industry knew, in contrast to industry awareness

the various ways that cigarettes were physically

modified and the nature and level of

compensation in response to design changes were

not well understood outside � were not well

understood by parties outside the tobacco

industry itself.

Public health officials had little basis to anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could design cigarettes to allow smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was represented by the machine measured yields of tar and nicotine.

That, lastly, dovetails perfectly with what they went into on cross-examination.  So even if it's not in and of itself admissible, they've opened the door to it on multiple occasions.

THE COURT:  Why do you think they opened the door to it?

Page 5127 they did on cross would essentially demonstrate

that we knew nothing more than the Public Health

Community, and we withheld nothing, which is in

and of itself a challenge of the findings on the

history.  That's essentially what their entire

cross was.  We made recommendations to the

Public Health Community.  The Public Health

Community knew this.  It was in Readers's

Digest.  It was understood in Reader's Digest

that this aspect of smoking, or that aspect of

smoking.  What we have here is a very discrete,

concrete, simple straightforward example where

they clearly knew more.  They clearly withheld

it.  They clearly were deceptive, and they

clearly lied to the Surgeon General and Public

Health Community.

If Your Honor looks at what's up on the

screen before the Court from the 2010 Surgeon

General's report, it says, Thus, by the 21st

Century, it was apparent that five decades after

evolving cigarette design -- five decades of

evolving cigarette design had not reduced

overall disease risk among smokers and new

designs were used by the tobacco industry as a

tool to undermined prevention and cessation

In this industry, in this lawsuit, historically has used design features to undermined prevention and cessation.  When they have a board on that thing that talks about the millions who quit, that's cessation, that's prevention.  If they're going to talk about quitters, I'm allowed to talk about how they undermined.  I am allowed to talk about the efforts they took.  Whether it's lights, low tars, filters, holes, ventilations, weight in tobacco, whatever it is, we're allowed to talk about the efforts they took to undermined the cessation and prevention efforts.  They put cessation and prevention squarely into the case.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, if I could just add something.  And that is, if a person smoked, say, an unfiltered cigarette all his life, say a Camel cigarette, which is unfiltered, all his life, and he's determined to be a class member, he is still entitled to the findings of the fraud and conspiracy.  The fraud and conspiracy is made up of the filter fraud and the light fraud, which is part of the fraud and conspiracy.  Because the tobacco companies

Page 5129 through the filters, through the lights, misled

the public, deceived the public by keeping away

the knowledge they actually had about

effectiveness of the filters, and the fact they

didn't really do anything, as well as the fact

that lights were not light at all.  And it was a

misnomer, it was a lie, basically, which is what

ultimately the FTC determined, which is why now

it's outlawed to call them lights.

So it's all part of that fraud and conspiracy, and you can't separate out -- as Mr. Gdanski said, you cannot separate out an act of the conspiracy when you're entitled to a finding, in this case, of a conspiracy and a fraud.  That's what the findings are.  It's crystal clear.  The defendants cannot argue against those findings.  Those are findings that are binding upon the defendants in this Court based on the Engle decision.

Also, Judge, as Mr. Gdanski pointed out, they've opened up the door by talking about the fact that we knew the Public Health Community knew everything we knew.  Now, by saying that, it's clear the public health environment did not know everything the tobacco companies knew.

Page 5130 Because when their internal documents came out,

it became clear what they knew inside, and

that's what we're trying to lay out for the

Court.  It became clear what they knew about

lights, that they weren't telling the Public

Health Community.

So while they stand before the jury and say, hey, the Public Health Community knew everything we knew, well, they really didn't. And what is later determined is lights were a fraud.  That's why they can't call them lights anymore.

If you walked into any store and tried to buy a light cigarette, you can't do that anymore because it was found to be a fraud.  Plain and simple, it was found to be a fraud and part of the conspiracy that we're in this courtroom today trying.  That's why it should be admissible.

early on in voir dire, the only thing the jury

will always be told is the findings say what

they say, they -- how did you put it?

MR. FURR:  They mean what they say, and they say what they mean.

MR. BRENNER:  They will not be instructed. I hope Mr. Hammer or Mr. Schlesinger or Mr. Gdanski won't tell this jury that a court has already found that whatever they want to say is the fraud is what that jury found is the fraud.

MR. BRENNER:  I listened to you guys quietly talk for 15 minutes.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.

MR. BRENNER:  So let's clear that.  There's no finding that this is a fraud.  I think Mr. Gdanski's whole discussion to you told you why this is a side show.  Mr. Gdanski said to you, Your Honor has already ruled that harm to others goes to reprehensibility.  In fact, it is the exact opposite.  They keep doing this to you.  They keep saying you have ruled something

They argued as hard as they could.  You went

back, and you read the cases.  You read State

Farms and you read Williams and you came back

and you keep telling them reprehensibility.

Yes, if the same harm that caused harm to the

plaintiff caused harm to others, it can go to

reprehensibility.  That is the law, and it is

the law that you have ruled.  You got it right.

Each time they stand up before you they said you've already said � look, their view of the world is anything that the tobacco companies did wrong goes to reprehensibility, whether it's any connection to Mr. Shulman at all.

That is their position.

Anything we did, whether it was connected to Mr. Shulman or not, goes to reprehensibility. That is not the law.  You have not found that to be the law.  If you had found that to be the law, it would be incorrect.  We can give you the cases again.  You can do the same thing you did last time and walk back.  It says it clear as day.

Page 5133 thought was very interesting.  You said to

Mr. Gdanski, what changed between the voir

dires.  The answer is nothing.  Nothing changed.

He went into a monologue about everything but

what you asked him.

The fact is you had this issue, I think you got it right the first time.  Nothing has changed.  Then you said to him:  How long do you have?  How long is not the question.  What does he want to put in front of this jury on lights that has any connection to Mr. Shulman?  That's the question.  They won't tell you that.  No matter what you, they will never answer that. They just say it's part of -- Mr. Hammer says it's already been found by the Engle court. That is the question.  Where is the connection to Mr. Shulman?  The answer is there's going to be none.  There will be none.  By definition there can be none.

So Mr. Edson may have something to add.

MR. EDSON:  I don't have much to add. Mr. Gdanski, again, misstated this witness' testimony when he said it was part of the conspiracy.  This witness was very clear that it was not.  I believe he said Florida law doesn't

testimony of that witness under oath is that

this was not part of the conspiracy.  As the

Court knows --

THE COURT:  His testimony today was that it is part of the fraud.

MR. EDSON:  But not the conspiracy.  If it was part -- it is not part of a fraud -- he thinks it's part of the fraud.  It is not part of a fraud that had anything to do with injury to this smoker.  He did not rely on it.  If they brought a light �

THE COURT:  If it's part of the fraud, doesn't it go to reprehensibility?

MR. EDSON:  No, Your Honor.  He thinks everything we've done is part of the fraud. This is a different -- it's an entire side show. It's an entirely different issue.  Mr. Gdanski spent 15 minutes making clear that it's a completely different story that they want to tell dealing with machines and holes and all this other stuff that we're going to have to get into.

It is unfairly prejudicial.  I objected to

THE COURT:  What about the argument � what about the � there was some additional voir dire that the advertising goes to the general market, that the advertising of low and tars (sic) is still something that all smokers would have been subjected to, and whether they smoked that brand or not, it's still goes to the perpetuation of the false advertising regarding smoking cigarettes in general?

MR. EDSON:  Except that if �

THE COURT:  That was an argument that was made, I think, and the witness did testify to that.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, if the marketing was seen by this plaintiff, it obviously didn't cause him to smoke those cigarettes because he never smoked them.  I don't know what the relevance could be.  It didn't affect him.  It had no effect on him.

MR. BRENNER:  I can assure you, if that's all they want to do is put in ads for low tar and lights, if that's what Your Honor is saying is the only marginal relevance, I don't think it's relevant but we can � that's not what they want to do.  That's what they try to argue through the voir dire, about the marketing of it, but that is not what these folks want to do. If that's what they want to do, we'd have already been done.  If Mr. Gdanski says to the Court,, all I want to do is put in ads, you know, I think we could probably live with it, but I think it's probably not right.

THE COURT:  Mr. Gdanski, are you trying to put in more than just the ads?

MR. GDANSKI:  Obviously.  I'm not going to play games.  Obviously.  Judge, on this idea it must all be the same conduct, I disagree with the legal principle.  We've argued that many, many times.  Let's assume it's right for a second.

The conduct is the fraud.  That's the conduct.  The conduct is this big fraud.  We've clearly put on evidence that the fraud impacted

other aspects of the fraud affected him.  It's

all in the fraud in its totality -- I'm sorry,

he smoked filters.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's a conspiracy to commit fraud to conceal information.  So you have to understand that what we're talking about in the context of the legal issue here is the fraud by concealment.  They concealed information.  As part of that concealment, it impacts smoking, it impacts culture, and impacts behavior.

That fraud impacted Mr. Shulman.  There's no question about that coming from just an evidentiary perspective.  Whether or not someone is willing to accept or reject the issue, there's clearly evidence of it, so it should come in.

And one thing I wanted to say earlier is that in the Engle trial, you know, the Engle findings say the words on the page are what they are.  But in the Engle trial, there was a tremendous amount of evidence about lights.  I'm not talking about, you know, sort of this side reference.  There were documents.  There's

important part of this litigation process.

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, if I may add, I think you picked up on it.  That is, if they would have told the truth about filters and not concealed what they knew about filters, if they would have told the truth about lights and not concealed the truth about lights, that they were nothing, it would have impacted the entire smoking world, impacted Mr. Shulman.  Because if they would have said, you know what, cigarettes really are deadly, that's -- and we're putting filters on them, but, you know what, folks, the filters don't work, cigarettes really are deadly and they'll kill you.  But, you know what, we put out lights, but those don't work either.  No matter what you smoke, it's going to kill you, that would have been the truth, but that was the truth they were concealing.

And so because it's a fraud and conspiracy to hide the truth, conceal the truth about the health effects of smoking, about the addictive nature of smoking, all of that information they had was concealed from the public, and it shaped the way the public smoked.  It shaped the way

Because had they come out in 1953 with the Frank Statement and said, in light of the mouse studies, hey, you know what, the doctors are right and you guys need to quit smoking, instead of taking out a full page ad about the harms of smoking, and then for the next 50 years and more conducted this conspiracy of fraud about filters and about lights, it would have changed the entire landscape of the health effects and the addictive nature of smoking.  That's what they're charged with concealing.  That's why I �

THE COURT:  Mr. Brenner, I will give you the last word.

MR. BRENNER:  I want to hand you the two Supreme Court cases.  They keep going back to this reprehensibility, and they keep saying it doesn't have to harm the plaintiff.  Your Honor, with all due respect, you've got -- I've highlighted State Farm and Williams, whichever one agrees are the controlling cases.  They both say the exact same thing.

MR. EDSON:  They keep blurring all of the lines.  Everything Mr. Hammer just talked about,

Page 5140 I think is in evidence.  We're not talking about

that.  He's talking about lights and low tars,

which whatever impact it had on other smokers is

irrelevant here because we know it had no impact

on this smoker.  He never switched to a light or

low tar cigarette.  It has nothing to do with

this case.

The Frank Statement is in evidence. Dr. Proctor has testified about it extensively. That's not the issue.

The Waxman hearings are in evidence. They've been able to put that in over our objection.

This is a total side tour.  All they're trying to do is to inflame the jury with evidence that has nothing to do with the two claims under Ciccone that can be asserted, which is concealment and agreement to conceal.

And just so Your Honor knows, the Engle jury was instructed that concealment is a statement that is misleading because it conceals or omits information.  The light and low tar statements were nothing that this smoker relied on.  He didn't smoke them.

THE COURT:  Well, that may be the case

going to reopen direct, and I think he only has

about ten minutes of this type of testimony

anyway.

And I'm going to reconsider my prior ruling.  And I'm not sure what is really --given the type of case, and given the Engle findings and given the testimony that there's been about fraud and conspiracy, I'm not sure there's anything that is going to be overly prejudicial about referring to what happened with light and low tars to this jury.

I don't know why it would be confusing because I think, on redirect, which I'll reopen up, or on cross-examination, you can simply say this smoker, as far as you know, never smoked light and low tars, and you can make that very clear to the jury that he didn't.

But it seems like it has some relevance, however tenuous, that the plaintiff can argue to the jury, who is the finder of fact -- I'm not the finder of fact so, I shouldn't be shutting things down -- that the jury should decide on the issue of the fraud by concealment, on the issue of the marketing, the advertising to the

And so it seems to have some relevance, and I'm

not sure it's outweighed at this point and �

when I really looked at it and I heard some

additional voir dire on it and some additional

argument by any potential confusion or prejudice

because I think it can be addressed by

cross-examination.

So I'll allow that.  And then what I'll do is I'm going to reopen up direct for purposes of the ten minutes of light and low tars, any questions that you think went beyond the scope of direct, as well as anything that you claim the defendants have opened up the door.  We can take up any objections at that point, and then when you're done with that, we'll find out if they've got any follow-up questions, and then at the end we'll do redirect.

After that, I will have another opportunity to question you again, and that should end what we're doing here.

MR. GDANSKI:  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  It's not one I thought I'd get to say. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    So light and low tar cigarettes, Dr. Proctor, when did light and low tar cigarettes come out on the market?

A    Actually, low tar cigarettes go back nearly 100 years.  There were already cigarettes being produced at the end of the 19th century that are advertised as low nicotine or safer, things like that.

In the 1930s and '40s there are claims

Page 5145 made, but the stronger commercial claims start to be

made in the � what's known as the Tar Derby, around

1960.  And for a number of years, it's sort of the

Wild West of claims, each company competing to have

less tar, less nicotine.

Q Now, we looked at a document that's in evidence, counsel showed you a copy of it of it, about something called the psychological crutch.

A    Yes, from 1964.

Q    Now that we're talking about the subject, can you describe how the light and low tar cigarettes were part of the industry giving the public, smokers, people a psychological crutch?

A    Well, again, this goes back a long time. Various claims being made that certain cigarettes are safer than others, whether that's based on testing or a particular additive that one of the companies would add to their cigarettes, claims of less nicotine and so forth.

But after 1964, it becomes a little more formal, you might say.  The different companies start relying more heavily on machine measured tar and nicotine yields based on a standardized smoking machine.  And they compete with one another on progressively lower tar and nicotine numbers, which

Page 5146 actually go down to near zero as they are measured by

the machines.  Because there were certain design

features that companies all developed that were able

to produce an extremely low machine measured yield on

the smoking machines, the robots that were measuring

these yields.

The problem is the machines were not

addicted and, therefore, they did not give accurate

measures of how people actually smoked these

so-called low tar cigarettes.  The low tar cigarettes

were not, in fact, low tar because smokers were able

to compensate.  They were able to extract as much tar

and nicotine and gas out of them as they needed given

their level of addiction.

So addiction is what essentially defeats

the claims of low tar.  The low tar cigarettes would

only have been low tar if the smoker was not

addicted.  But given addiction, they were able to

adjust their behavior and absorb arbitrarily large

amounts of poison into their lungs.

Q    You're referring to them as low tars. That's true as well for what's ultimately called lights?

A    Yes.  Lights are simply a version of low tars.  It's more of a marketing concept.  It simply

mayonnaise, light beer, things like that.  The fact

is that the so-called light cigarettes were made from

identical tobacco.

Q    Okay.

A    There was no fundamental difference.  The only difference was in certain design features that allowed air to rush into the smoke chamber, and this was easily defeated by the smoker.

Q    So what was � you mentioned the Tar Derby, right ?

A    Yes.

Q    What exactly that was process?

A That was this unregulated period, in around 1960, when the different companies were making really unsubstantiated claims about our brand being low tar, our brand having less nicotine.

Q    Okay.  I'm going to ask you a question that you might smile and laugh at for a second. Dr. Proctor, you don't know whether or not Mr. Shulman smoked low tar, right?

Page 5149 delivered the same.  That's why the filters were not

really filters.  The low tars were not really low

tars.  The lights were not really lights.

The features that they put on were several. One, the low tar and light cigarettes just weighed less.  There was about only one-third of the tobacco in a low tar cigarette as in a cigarette from the 1920s.  So they're just lightweight cigarettes.  The analogy you can think of is it's as if you had, say, vodka in a smaller bottle and then you would say this is light vodka.  There's just less vodka.  So light cigarettes were just lightweight cigarettes.  That's point one.

Point two is they had little microscopic holes that were put in through an electrostatic process, also a laser perforation process, and a physical knife process.  Those were the three ways. Little holes were put around that when you put it into a machine to measure the tar and nicotine yields, air would rush through these holes and dilute the smoke and it would appear to a machine that they were low tar.  You could put so many holes around them, and some companies did, that they essentially gave no tar.  They were essentially zero tar cigarettes, as they were advertised.

Page 5150 Q    So if they have zero tar, then why aren't

they lighter?

A    Because they were only zero tar to a machine.  An actual human who smoked them could easily cover those with their lips, their hands, inhale deeper, inhale longer and so forth.  The tobacco itself was no different.  So in no real sense for a human were they low tar.

Q    On the ELMO and on the screen, we have a Marlboro Gold, right? A    Yes.

Q    Dr. Proctor, in this country, can you have a cigarette that's sold any longer that's called or labeled light or low tar?

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor.  If we can approach?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's light or low tar. THE COURT:  Let me have you approach. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) MR. BRENNER:  So Mr. Gdanski, now, under the guise of a, just going to tell a little 10-minute story, Judge, is now trying to introduce to the jury that a federal court in Washington, D.C. or the Federal Trade Commission

of the term.  To say that we have gone from far

afield of the case to way out of space is an

understatement.  What in the world does this

have to do with Mr. Shulman or this case?

THE COURT:  What's the relevance to that at this point in terms of the -- this a recent ruling or when was that ruling?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't think it's a ruling. I think it's from the FDA.

THE COURT:  How does it go to the fraud? He can testify about the fraud.  He can testify about the misleading.  But in terms of getting a finding from another court --

MR. GDANSKI: I'm not asking about a finding.

MR. BRENNER:  Or the FDA.  It's hearsay.

MR. GDANSKI:  The fact of the matter is ultimately they were banned as a fraud.  How can he not talk about them being banned as a fraud --

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection as hearsay. At this point it's hearsay.  I'm sustaining.

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.

Q    Dr. Proctor �

THE COURT:  Can the parties approach real

quick again? (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.) THE COURT:  I just want the record to

reflect that I've decided I'm going to sustain

the objection based not only on hearsay, but

also on hearsay and relevance grounds. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q Dr. Proctor, can you make out � I can � can you make out where the ventilation holes are on this cigarette from what we're looking at here?

A    It's not blown up enough for me.  They tend to be in circular rings around the so-called filter.

Q Maybe I can pass this out amongst the jury and they can visualize and identify it. Do you want to put a mark on where it starts?

A    I can try.

Q    Do you have a pen?

A    No.

Q    I'11 get you one.

THE COURT:  Need a pen?

A    The light is so poor up here.

Q    Dr. Proctor, can smokers � we just tried to identify them when we're looking for them.  Can smokers in the ordinary course of smoking, are they able to identify, visualize and understand that there were ventilation holes?

A    No.  They're deliberately microscopic.

cigarettes?

A    No, it's an unconscious process.

Q    Were the machines, the smoking machines that you discussed, were those machines smoking the same way that humans smoked?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  We've heard this explanation twice already, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained on cumulative grounds. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q   Did the tobacco companies advertise that there were microscopic ventilation holes in cigarettes which blocked � which the smoker would block with their hands?

A    No.  Very early on in the '50s and '60s they did advertise porosity, little pores.  This is really prior to the point where they became dishonest.  They would talk about the fresh air ventilation, but they stopped doing that after the 60s.

Q   Can machines get addicted, obviously?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.  This is what we talked about multiple times.

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    So were lights and low tars a fraud?

A    Yes, they were a fraud.  They were not safe or � they were actually slightly more dangerous because of certain extra TSNAs that is were produced due to the lower burning temperature.

Q    Tell the jury why, as opposed to being safer or reducing the risk, light and low tar cigarettes actually were in some respects more dangerous.

A    There's several respects.  One is they actually intercepted quitting.  So people who otherwise might have quit, wanted to quit, wanted to reduce, they would smoke a light cigarette thinking they would be safer instead of quitting.  So that's one sense in which they actually caused more harm. The second sense I've already mentioned. They were identical.  There were no difference.  The smoker would smoke them more intensively and get just as much tar and nicotine.

The third reason is that the lower burning temperature actually produced more TSNAs, the most carcinogenic component of smoke.  The dilution also had some effect on that.

were more dangerous.

Q    When was it, Dr. Proctor, that for the

first time the Public Health Community published

their conclusions that light and low tar cigarettes

were, in fact, no safer or healthier than ordinary

cigarettes.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Hearsay, Your

Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It goes to notice.  It's

You're withdrawing it?

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not withdrawing it.

approach.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

because they have lights and low tar in the case

now doesn't mean it's not hearsay.  It's a 2008

BY MR. GDANSKI

Q    Dr. Proctor, the question is when was it that the Public Health Community changed its course and determined that lights and low tar cigarettes were no safer than ordinary cigarettes and were, in fact, potentially more dangerous?

MR. BRENNER:  Same objections, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  There's three stages to that process.  The first evidence came in the early 1980s, when people doing studies of smokers smoking different brands of cigarettes, light cigarettes, non-light cigarettes, it was discovered quite by accident that they had the same amount of nicotine metabolites in their blood, cotinine it's called.  That was evidence, and surprising evidence, that smokers of lights and non-lights were getting exactly the same amount of tar and nicotine in their bodies.  So that was the first stage.

The second stage is in 2001 when the whole series of other evidence accumulated to the point that there was a consensus in the scientific community that lights were no safer. The key development there was the release of the

showed design features and knowledge within the

industry that lights were no safer, that it

really was a dishonest process from the

beginning.

The third stage is the recognition, more recently as a result of further analysis, that the physical properties of lights versus low tars were such that they actually produced more harm.  And that's in the most recent Surgeon General's report. Q    Okay.  Dr. Proctor �

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, move to strike.

MR. FURR:  Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR: Your Honor, if there's one thing this witness should know by this point after six days, he should know that the Surgeon General's reports have been excluded, and he is not to use questions as an excuse to start reciting hearsay findings from the Surgeon General's report.

THE COURT:  Probably at the break because there was no answer given by a witness, so it's not in evidence.  Whatever questions that are provided are not in evidence, so I don't see how

Page 5165 Where a Philip Morris employee runs a study

of nine of their employees -- a two-week study

of nine of their employees switching between

Marlboro Reds and Marlboro Lights, and

Dr. Proctor has said that because of the size of

the study and because of the parameters of the

study, he doesn't find the study reliable.  I

can show you the testimony.  Therefore, there's

no -- we -- the possibility for prejudice

outweighs any relevance since he said the study

has no reliability.

THE COURT:  Does everybody agree that this witness has already said this is unreliable?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. BRENNER:  I'll show it to you.

THE COURT:  What about this one?

MR. BRENNER:  That's not � actually the one I have is much bigger than that so I don't know what that is.  I have one that's three times that size.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm sure there's a lot of pages in it.  Those are the pages I want to use.

THE COURT:  These are the pages he wants to use.  Do you have any objections to these pages?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, here is 1075.  It

She's �

THE COURT:  Hold it yourself.  I don't need to look at it.

MR. BRENNER:  He's being asked if the study -- there's not a basis for a conclusion. He says, No, I would agree.  I would agree.

You can read the whole thing.  It goes back to the basic design as to what you would expect these things to be doing.

She's sort of trapped, like the author of the study.

I think in a sequence Barbara Goodman is trapped in a sequence where you have to work with these weird delivery things, and the whole idea in my view is twisted.

Okay, but I agree with you.  No one document is Achille's.  All these documents have flaws in a way.  They're all -- I'm trying to get to.

They are a lot of complexities.  You can't

And then she's asked -- he's asked � again, asked about that study and a different study.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't see any testimony, anything that says that it's not reliable.  The word "reliable" is nowhere in there.  It's in your question �

MR. BRENNER:  There's no real basis for her conclusion to me that's reliable.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not what it says.  You have to read the whole answer.

THE COURT:  The problem is that you're introducing this for purposes of the study, and the witness has said there's no basis for the conclusions.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm introducing it as notice that the tobacco companies had in 1975 that smokers who smoked light cigarettes were getting just as much tar and nicotine as smokers who smoked non-light cigarettes.

THE COURT:  So I'll admit this only for notice purposes.

MR. BRENNER:  For notice purposes, is that what the Court --

MR. BRENNER:  What possible relevance �

THE COURT:  You can cross-examine him and say and -- and impeach him on the basis that he indicated this is not reliable, but they're saying this is on notice that lights were no different than other cigarettes.

MR. BRENNER:  I'll restate my objection.

THE COURT:  How about this one?

MR. BRENNER:  I have to see what it is.

THE COURT:  I can give that instruction that it's admitted only for notice.

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, we'll take that instruction.

MR. GDANSKI:  I want to put in those pages. While we're doing that, I can do it this now or I can do it later.  I think I know where the Court is going, but I do want to make a record. We tried to make a motion contemporaneously.

MR. GDANSKI:  And you did it.

MR. EDSON:  And the Court did not allow us to on Mr. Gdanski's question.  I understand the question wasn't answered, but the jury still heard out of Mr. Gdanski's mouth that the Federal Trade Commission found in 2008, quote, that they were not going to let the tobacco companies wrap their misleading and nicotine --

THE COURT:  It was a question, so it's not in evidence.  If you want me to give an instruction on that, I can.  Tell me what instruction you want me to give or I can strike it.

MR. EDSON:  That's the problem �

MR. GDANSKI:  Strike the question about wrapping their labels as misleading and fraudulent --

MR. EDSON:  No, no, that's more prejudicial.

Q    Dr. Proctor, the machine that we discussed, there was some indication in publicly available sources that I can show you or defense can show you, if we had time, that it didn't measure exactly the same way smokers smoked?

A    Well, that's eventually discovered by the scientific community.  I'm not sure � the answer to your question depends a lot on which decade we're talking about.

Q Was there examples of it in any decade where the public � public information knew that machines didn't take in the smoke the same way a smoker would?

A    Well, sure.  Yeah, at various points different people make that observation.

Q    Understood.

safer than regular cigarettes?

Q    You've gone onto the company's web sites? A    Yes.

Page 5173 MR. FURR:  I want to make a motion on this.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  I move for a mistrial.  This

lawyer is knowingly violating your pretrial

ruling that you ruled on that they cannot

prosecute this case by asking witnesses things

that we failed to admit.  They have the burden

of proof.  They can't prove their case that way.

You ordered that in pretrial.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's just the opposite.

MR. FURR:  He keeps asking it over and

over.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor has ruled �

that's not accurate.

THE COURT:  I sustained your objection.

You said ten minutes.  Ten minutes is up.  This

subject matter needs to be moved on.  Finish the

rest of it.  Enough is enough.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

jury will have it, and another one, too, on this

light issue.  Dr. Proctor, 1975, it's from Philip

earlier indicated that Marlboro Light cigarettes were

You're familiar with this data from Barbara Goodman?

A    Yes.

Q    What was internally demonstrated � by 1975 internally demonstrated inside Philip Morris while they are publicly selling light and low tars and advertising them as safer?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, objection to the argumentative -- last part of the question. I'll leave it at that.  Move to strike the question.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    In 1975 were they advertising and marketing low tar cigarettes as safer?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative and leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained on leading. BY MR. GDANSKI: Q    Sure.

Page   5176 MR.   FURR:      That's   a   legal   issue   for  the

Court.

THE COURT:  I'll strike that from the

record.  Please move on.

MR. GDANSKI:  Understood.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    Counsel for Liggett asked you questions,

Dr. Proctor, about Liggett behaving differently.

Isn't it true, Dr. Proctor, that Liggett had a brand

of cigarettes and all of their brands of cigarettes

in the late 1990s that on the side of the pack they

put, Smoking is addictive, on the pack and Philip

Morris bought the Chesterfield brand and took off the

label from the pack that, Smoking is addictive, after

the �

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, you keep telling

us that just a question is not enough.  Frankly,

Your Honor, I just don't accept that premise.

Mr. Gdanski's questions were testimony on areas

that he knows are highly objectionable, highly

prejudicial, and it doesn't matter how many

times he does it, you say to us, it's just a

Here he's asking a question which is clearly preempted, which is that we should have done something different with our warnings. Okay.  He wants to put on evidence of Liggett's warnings in 1998, by the way, 23 years after the man quit smoking.  We have gone so far afield but this idea that questions aren't poisoning this jury, Your Honor, I can't accept it's not �

THE COURT:  Isn't his argument, though, that there was some label on there that was then removed?

MR. HAMMER:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Isn't that different?

MR. BRENNER:  No, I'm being punished �

THE COURT:  Why would that not be a proper subject matter?

MR. BRENNER:  Because I'm being punished for how I'm labeling my cigarettes in accordance with law.  That's exactly how I'm being punished.

MR. GDANSKI:  No.  That is not accurate.

MR. EDSON:  They are not allowed as a matter of federal law � I'm sorry, argue that

Page 5178 as a matter of state law we have a duty to do

anything else on the label.  As a matter of

federal law the warnings that we had on our

packages --

THE COURT:  This company chose to put labels on there voluntarily.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

MR. BRENNER:  That's not the question.

MR. EDSON:  That's not the question.

MR. BRENNER:  The question is that we bought the brand and took them off.

MR. EDSON:  The question was Philip Morris �

MR. GDANSKI:  It was take it off voluntarily.

MR. BRENNER:  Why don't we start with evidence 101?  What relevance -- what claim in this case does it go to?

MR. GDANSKI:  Come on.  It goes to the highly addictive nature of smoking, Judge. There is a finding in this case of a highly addictive nature of smoking.

Philip Morris buys a brand of one company voluntarily, which is legally permissible -- and Philip Morris is allowed, by the way, to do it.

can we not after that cross, where they're

talking about --

THE COURT:  You're right.  They were

legally allowed to take it off, so I'm going to

sustain the objection.

MR. GDANSKI:  No, but the point is �

THE COURT:  I'm going to sustain the

objection.  Move on.

MR. BRENNER:  Move to strike the last

question.

THE COURT:  The last question has been

stricken from the record.  The jury should

disregard it.

BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q    I'll ask it a little bit differently.

Dr. Proctor, did the Liggett company have a brand

that had on their cigarettes in the late 1990s

voluntary labels on the packs �

MR. GDANSKI:  Rob, can we get the elmo?

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, can we approach

before we go into this?

MR. GDANSKI:  I haven't finished asking the

question, Judge.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not talking about Philip Morris taking off labels.  I'm talking about Liggett now.

MR. BRENNER:  It doesn't matter, Your Honor.  Think of what's happening here, Your Honor.  He stands in front of the jury and says, Did Liggett have a label that Philip Morris took off the pack?

MR. GDANSKI:  And you sustained the objection.

MR. BRENNER:  If he's going to do something like this, how does he not advise the Court before we leave sidebar that he's about to do the exact same thing?

MR. GDANSKI:  So Liggett on cross can get up there and say, we behaved differently, we came out and gave out public documents early on. I can't explain that --

THE COURT:  What is that you wanted to explain?

MR. GDANSKI:  Finish my direct. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

MR. FURR:  Judge, can we approach a minute?

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't need to approach. (Thereupon, the bench conference began.)

MR. HAMMER:  Judge, I think at this point Mr. Gdanski finished his lights presentation, lights and low tars, as to that area, and as far as redirect or opening the door, we can address that in the morning.

MR. GDANSKI:  My position is that anything you open the door to is meant for redirect.

THE COURT:  It's your choice.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't know what you mean, it's my choice.

THE COURT:  All right.  So you have nothing else on direct right now?

MR. GDANSKI:  I have a lot for redirect.

THE COURT:  Right.  I asked, do you have any more for direct?

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sorry to keep you here so late.  Thank you for your cooperation to stay here.  We were hoping to finish this witness, but he's going to have to come back tomorrow morning because there's still more questions, and there's no way I'm going to keep you any longer.

my schedule tomorrow isn't much better.  We'll

do the best we can, but we will take this

witness up in the morning and finish him up.  I

have a Bar Association thing that I have to do

during the lunch break so we're going to still

have a longer lunch break tomorrow.

And we cannot get started-- I have calendar call tomorrow, which doesn't start until 9:00 and usually goes for an hour.  The good news is you don't have to be here until 10:00.  The deputy will tell you a few minutes before 10:00. So we won't get started any earlier than 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.  So you don't have to be here until 10:00 or five to 10:00, whatever the deputy tells you.

Don't discuss this among yourselves, among any family members, among any third parties, or anybody else.  Don't do any independent investigation or research on your own about this case.  Don't use any electronic devices about the case.  Don't look anything up about the case.  Don't go on any social web sites or make any comments about the case or communicate about the case or post anything about the case or your

Page 5186 jury service.  Thank you very much.  Can we get

them an escort to their cars.

THE BAILIFF:  Yes. (Thereupon, the jurors exited the courtroom.)

THE COURT:  All right.  I have calendar call tomorrow.  It's not as bad of a calendar call as I normally have.  When I have a normal calendar call, it usually takes me about an hour to go through calendar call but I think I only have 17 cases on it.  So there's a possibility that I could end early.

So I would suggest that the lawyers -- I would ask that the lawyers be here -- even though I told the jury 10:00, I'd ask that the lawyers be here at 9:30 instead so that you guys can be set up, first of all, and ready to go.

And secondly, if I finish early, then I'll come out here and I'll take up any issues that you guys will have before we bring the jury out so that we can start by 10:00.  So you don't have to get here before 9:30, like minutes before, just around 9:30, 9:35, I'd be all here just in case I'm done by then.  And then this witness is coming back tomorrow.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  I would not do that.  I would not get a flight right after lunch.  We're going to be taking a lunch break at probably 11:45 or something like that, and you may not be done by then.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

You chose not to on one of them.  You chose to have me give an instruction on another one.  I'm happy to give any instruction you

where we

A.
	Okay.
	

Q.
	What I'm going to do now is follow up
	
with what Mr. Gdanski
		started with you at about

6:30 last night, and that was on the topic of
		
light cigarettes.
		


	Do you recall that?
	
A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	Let me get the microphone.  Okay.

opportunity to briefly cross-examine you

yesterday, we spoke about filtered cigarettes.

Do you recall that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's something you had discussed with Mr. Gdanski during the � his initial examination of you?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Now you understand and you went through with Mr. Furr that at least you had an understanding from Mr. Gdanski, he told you the � told you the brands of cigarettes that Mr. Shulman smoked.

Do you recall that?

A.  Yes, I don't recall that well, but...

Q.  Right.  You recall enough to know that among those brands was at least one filtered cigarette, right, a couple?

Do you recall that?

A.  I actually just don't recall that.

Q.  Okay.  You do recall that the topic last night, that the lights � that Mr. Shulman never smoked any light cigarette, correct?

A.  Again, I don't dispute that.  I just

Q.  Okay.  Well, for the purposes of my questions then, I'm going to ask you to assume that the evidence in the case will be that Mr. Shulman at no time ever smoked a light cigarette.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  He never smoked the Marlboro Light that Mr. Gdanski passed around to the jury.  Do you understand that?

A.  I believe you.

Q.  Okay.  And the same is true, he didn't smoke a light cigarette made by any other defendant or any other tobacco manufacturer?

A.  Okay.

Q.  Okay?  Now let's get some basics on light cigarettes.

First of all, lights, sometimes called low-tar cigarettes, they include less tobacco than a regular cigarette, correct?

A.  Typically, yes, though, in the case of a Marlboro Light versus a Marlboro, really the only difference is the � the holes, but the more common pattern to make low tar, lights, is, among other things, just put less tobacco in.

Page 5202 Q.  Sometimes they do it by holes; sometimes

they do it by less tobacco?

A.  Exactly.

Q.  All right.

A.  There are various techniques that can be used.

Q.  And that's both by volume and mass, correct, when it's less tobacco?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  The first light cigarette came on the market in 1971; that's correct?

A.  Yes, that's the Marlboro Light.

Q.  Right.  And then after that, lots of other light cigarettes came on the market, correct?

A.  People imitated it, yes.

Q.  Okay.  When light cigarettes came on the market, there was no longer TV advertising for any cigarettes, correct?

A.  That's correct.  There's no direct cigarette commercials, though there were product placement and indirect ads in the form of sports sponsorships.

Q.  Right.

Q.  No television advertis- � there's never been a television advertisement for a light cigarette, correct, other than what you were saying, there were product placements?

A.  Yes, exactly.

Q.  Okay.  And you know about that same time, just the following year, all cigarette advertisements for any type of cigarette included the Surgeon General's warning on them?

A.  Yes, except for like the banners in the stadiums, things like that.

Q.  Like print ads in magazines and things like that?

A.  Those did, yes.

Q.  Yes.  And the Surgeon General's warning was � depending on the year it was, was the same Surgeon General's warning whether it was a light cigarette, a filtered cigarette, an unfiltered cigarette, always the same?

A.  It was.

Q.  Just so we're clear, the design changes that you talked about to reduce tar and nicotine, you're not aware of any evidence that any tobacco company believed at any time that the design

Page 5204 changes that they were making to cigarettes to

reduce tar and nicotine levels would actually

increase the risk of those cigarettes?

A.  Well, you packed a lot into that question.

For one thing, to reduce tar and nicotine, that's not true from the beginning. That was not the purpose of low-tars or lights.

The purpose was to fool people into thinking they were safer.  They were not, in fact, reduced tar and nicotine in any sense.

MR. BRENNER:  Can I have the Irimi deposition, please?

May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BRENNER:   (Hands transcript.)

THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

MR. BRENNER:  You're welcome. Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  This is a sworn deposition � sworn testimony you gave in a case called Heather Irimi? A.  Yes.

Q.  I'm going to get you a page number in a second.

Okay.  I'm starting on Page 164, Line

MR. BRENNER:  164, 25, through 165, 14 � I'm sorry, through Line 7, I'm sorry.

MR. GDANSKI:  I object.  It's not the same question.  It's improper impeachment.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Do you remember being asked the following questions and giving the following answers:

Do you have any evidence that Lorillard believed at any time that the design changes that it was making to its cigarettes to reduce the tar and nicotine levels would actually increase the risk?

ANSWER:  I don't think I've ever seen anything in the documents like that.

A.  Yeah, that's a very different question and a very different answer.

Q.  QUESTION:  What about for R.J. Reynolds?

ANSWER:  Not for any company.

Did I read that correctly? A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, I renew my objection.  It's just not the same question.

THE COURT:  That's what you'll cover on

Do you have any evidence that any tobacco company at any time, that the design changes that they were making to their cigarettes to reduce the tar and nicotine levels would actually increase the risk?

A.  No, I don't have a document that says exactly that.

Q.  Okay.  And you agree, you're not aware of any evidence that � that any of the companies believed at any time that the design changes that they were making to the cigarettes to reduce the tar and nicotine levels would actually make them more addictive, correct?

MR. GDANSKI:  I think this has been just asked and answered.

MR. BRENNER:  No.  One was as to �

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I don't know of an exact document that says exactly that.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  � to look through documents.  I review those as part of my scholarship,, and I'm hired for my scholarship.

So that's an offensive guestion.  I am not, you know � that is not my job.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  In your search of all these documents, you've never found a document that either says the design changes by the companies were made to make the cigarettes more � more � to increase the risk or to make them more addictive, correct?

A.  Yeah, there was no deliberate effort to make them more addictive or to make them more harmful.

Q.  Okay.

A.  There � I would modify the first part of what I said in my answer.  There was a deliberate effort to make sure they were addictive and did not fall below some level that would make them not addictive.

Page 52CM That's the whole point of that document

we showed where it said, determined minimum

nicotine to keep smokers hooked.

Q.  Right.

A. That was the goal, was to determine the minimum nicotine to keep smokers hooked. That's Philip Morris's own words.

Q.  Right.  We went through that.  You went through that on direct and we also went through on cross yesterday that Philip Morris, in fact, made three cigarettes that were below that level, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  So let's go on to what you talked about yesterday.  You talked about several reasons that you believe that light cigarettes are more dangerous, and I want to walk through them with you a bit.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  One of which you talked about the advertising for light cigarettes, and I don't have the exact quote, but I believe you said they are "safety themed"?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Another thing � and we're going

Page 5209 to go through each of those.  I just want to sort

of lay them out what they were.  Okay?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Another thing you said was that light cigarettes are more � are more dangerous because they tend to intercept quitters?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I think those were the words you used.

A.  Right.  People who would otherwise have quit saw in lights an opportunity to achieve safety without quitting.

Q.  Right.

A.  And they actually, you know, caused harm � more harm than they would have.

Q.  Because they continued to smoke?

A.  Yes, because they continued to smoke.

Q.  So you have Smoker X who is smoking, let's just say a full-flavored cigarette, and instead of quitting, they switch to a light cigarette and, therefore, they keep smoking, and you believe that's harmful to their health, which cigarette smoking is harmful to their health?

A.  Well, yeah, right.  It's not my belief; it's a fact.

Q.  Yeah, no � no, I didn't say anything to

Page 5210 the contrary.

So I'm just trying to define what

"intercepting quitters" is.

A.  Yes, it's preventing people from quitting by offering from a spurious gimmick alternative.

Q.  Right.  And then you said that � again, I'm paraphrasing, but that people who smoke light cigarettes get the same amount of tar and nicotine as people who smoke � I don't know if you want to use the term "regular" or "full-flavor cigarettes."

A.  Sure.

Q.  Pretty synonymous, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's a concept that you called � and that's well known in science.  It's a concept called "compensation."  I think you used that word.

A.  Right, it's the subset of the property of addiction.  If you're addicted, you will self-titrate and get the same amount of tar and nicotine and gas.  It's important not to leave off the gas.

Q.  Okay.  And then the fourth thing that

Page 5211 you said was that there are suggestions � or

there is evidence that smoking lower tar or light

cigarettes in some ways increases the carcinogenic

or cancer risk?

A.  Yes.  There's some recent evidence of that.

Q.  Right, to a particular kind of lung cancer, right?

A.  Well, not just that.  Actually � I mean, that's part of it.  The adenocarcinoma is increased, but there's also just the sheer fact that the TSNAs are increased, which are the most potent carcinogens �

Q.  Okay.

A.  � in smoke, apart from the polonium-210, the radioactive isotope.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So the actual way that the tobacco is burned in the so-called light cigarette creates a higher level of the TSNAs.

Q.  So let's start with that last claim, the last � the claim that the light cigarettes, I'm just going to say, may be more carcinogenic �

whether it's true or not, but if that were true,

if we were to assume that were true, that would be

And you agree that the ads don't say �

for example, they never say light cigarettes are

safe, correct?

A.  No.

Q.  They never say light cigarettes are

That didn't happen with Mr. Shulman if you accept my representation that he never smoked a light cigarette?

A.  If it's true, it's true. Q.  Okay.  So I do want to go over briefly with you � I believe you showed one document yesterday during this part of your examination, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there was just one that was shown.

this was not.  Okay?

reference to machine smoking � this study or this

smoking cigarettes, not humans smoking cigarettes,

Q.  Well, actually it's �

A.  She's looking at human smokers and how they behave and comparing it to machine data.

Q.  Well, actually not, Doctor.  Is that your understanding of the document, that this is human smokers?

A.  Well, actually the human smoking is done through a simulator.

Q.  Correct.  It's a machine.

A.  Yeah, but it's a simulator machine rather than an FTC machine.

Q.  I understand that.

A.  That's the fundamental comparison.

Q.  You understand this is machine-smoked cigarettes, no the FTC machine.  It's something they actually called the human smoke simulator, I think, if I have the term right.  It's a machine �

A.  That's right.  It simulates � it's supposed to � it's a machine they designed to exactly replicate �

Q.  What?

A.  � how a smoker would smoke and then to vary that.

Page 5220 Q.  Do you recall what in this study they

were trying to replicate?

A.  Well, they were comparing Marlboro Reds and Marlboro Lights, is what I remember.

Q.  Okay.  So let me help you.  Let me see if I can help orient you to the document a little bit.

So what they did was � referencing this January 3 document � January 3rd document, it talks about here is they took a total of nine smokers, nine, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And those nine were not some sort of random sample or scientifically valid sample; they were nine employees, I believe, of the Philip Morris Research & Development Department.

A.  Yes.

Q.  So they take nine smokers, and those are the smokers � and we'11 talk about that � that actually smoked the cigarette and are talked about in the January 3rd memo, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. And what they did was in order to have the machine smoked, they looked at nine smokers and they looked at how they smoked, and that means

	things like how many puffs, how deep the puffs,
	
2
	and things like that, right?
	
3
	A.
	That's right.

4
	Q.
	And then they loaded that data into a

5
	machine,
	correct?

6
	A.
	Yes.

7
	Q.
	And they had the machine smoke the

8
	cigarett
	es, correct?

9
	A.
	That's right.

10
	Q.
	So of the nine smokers in this study,

11
	five of
	them were regular Marlboro full-flavored

12
	smokers,
	which are Marlboro 85s, right?

13
	A.
	That's right.

14
	Q.
	You agree that's what that's shorthand

15
	for?
	

16
	A.
	Yes.

17
	Q.
	And four of them were Marlboro Light

18
	smokers?
	

19
	A.
	Right.

20
	Q.
	Okay.  So now we have a study.  If we're

21
	trying to look at, as you suggested to the jury,
	
22
	that thi
	s document shows that Marlboro Red

23
	smokers,
	when they switched to Marlboro Lights,

24
	get the
	same amount of tar and nicotine, we're

25
	actually
	down to five smokers?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So this is a study of five smokers whose input is � whose data is input into a machine, and then they were studying five machines smoking?

A.  Yes, that's right.

Q.  Okay.  Now let's see what else we can go through this document.

What they did was with the people, the employees, on the January 3rd, they had them smoke their regular brands for two weeks, not a long-term study, two weeks, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And then they forced a switch.  They actually forced the Red � the Marlboro regular smokers to lights and Marlboro Light smokers to regulars, right?

A.  I think that's right.

Q.  But before they got to anything about a switch, they actually looked at:  Okay.  If you're a Marlboro Red smoker, that's what you do, that's what you're used to smoking, what tar and nicotine are you getting, and they looked at the same for the Marlboro Light smokers �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � correct?

We ended up with five Marlboro Red smokers that

were going to switch to Marlboro Lights and four

from Marlboro Lights to Marlboro Reds?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So instead of an even number, that's why they ended up with nine instead of eight?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you know that these folks is who they got the data to do the September memo, meaning how they smoked, right?

A.  Yes, I think that's correct.

Q.  Okay.  So � but these folks, they also looked at what was going on with them when they were smoking their cigarettes and switching, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q. Okay. So let's go to the conclusion section of the memo. So when they � this is under Conclusions, Group Analysis, okay?

When they actually looked at how human beings were smoking Marlboro Reds and when they changed to Marlboro Lights, they found that the � they actually did not change their smoking parameters significantly, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Then there's a table which actually looks at � I want to go the other way. So it looks at what happened to these five folks when they went from Marlboro regulars, or 85s � that would be this, right (indicating)?

A.  Yes.

Q.  � to Marlboro Lights, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Right.  So if you look at the bottom, the "M" number is when they're smoking the regulars, and the "L" number is when they're smoking the Lights, correct?

Q.  The study is done on the big basis of nine cigarettes, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go to the Bates stamp ending in 87, which is about ten pages into the document.

A.  Right.

Q.  Let me see if I can zoom in a little bit.

All right.  So this was actually looking at about 200 smokers.  Do you see the number of smokers on the right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Two hundred simulated smokers.  So it's doing the same thing the study you shared on direct is doing except it has got about 20 times more of a sample size, correct?

A.  Yeah, I think that's right.

Q.  Okay.  And the other big difference, which is obvious from this piece of paper, or this page, is that instead of looking at just Marlboro 85s, which I'm going to highlight the males for now, but we can � because there's a lot more of them in this one and Mr. Shulman is a male, and Marlboro Lights.

scientific term, I think, but they're layered with

bias, right?

Q.  Right.

And because of that, both the September 17th study, which you talked about with Mr. Gdanski, September 17th, '95 [sic] and September 20th, 1976, neither of them, in your opinion, put anyone in a position, or Ms. Goodman, the author of the study, to really say whether people were getting less tar from one cigarette or another?

A.  Well, yeah, I mean they do � the value of the documents is they express that there's no difference.  As Goodman says, in effect, the Marlboro 85 smokers did not achieve any reduction in smoke intake �

Q.  Okay.

A.  � in cigarettes, in smoking Marlboro Lights.

Q.  Right. So �

A.  They're also not measuring how many cigarettes people are smoking.  They're highly artificial studies.  They're also not long-term.

Q.  Well, actually they do measure the amount that people were smoking.  The memo that you relied on found that two people increased the amount they smoked and two people decreased, right?

But in either event, the machine study with five smokers, you like that conclusion; you think that's reliable.  The one that finds the exact opposite result with more people and more cigarettes, that one you find unreliable?

THE COURT:  Okay.  Sustained. Ask another question.

Q.  (BY MR. BRENNER)  Do you find that the results that we just went through on the 200-smoker study are more, less, or equally reliable to the same study done on five smokers?

A.  I think they're both full of flaws.

Q.  Okay.  Now you're aware that around this same time period that there were large-scale epidemiological studies which we talked about with filters.

Similarly there were similar studies done comparing the cancer risk of people who smoke low tar versus regular full-flavored cigarettes, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And those studies had � there were massive studies, right?

A.  Some of them were, yes.

Their position is that smokers were smoking low-tar cigarettes because of advertising and whatnot, as opposed to what you're about to go through, that all these epidemiological studies were published and publicized and that � and were telling people that low tars were safer.

Q.  I didn't expect to see you again, but nice to see you anyway.  Last night around 7 p.m. Mr. Gdanski asked you a question that I probably should have asked you.

He asked you if you knew whether Mr. Shulman ever smoked a low-tar or a light cigarette, and you said you didn't know, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  However, I want to return to something we discussed briefly yesterday and that is, in preparation for your deposition in this case, Mr. Gdanski gave you some information about Mr. Shulman's brand history.  Do you recall that?

A.  Barely, yes.

Mr. Gdanski � excuse me, that Mr. Shulman smoked

was unfiltered, right?

A.  Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  This has all been covered. I object.  It's outside the scope. THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. FURR)  And so by definition, the unfiltered Lucky Strike brand smoked by Mr. Shulman would not have had the type of ventilation holes in the filter that you discussed with respect to Marlboro, correct?

A.  Yes.  All cigarettes have some degree of porosity in the paper, and that functions essentially as � the same as ventilation, allowing air to rush in, but the ones deliberately put on cigarettes, really beginning in the late '50s, early '60s, and then later with lights, those would not have been there, the little perforations.

Q.  With respect to the ventilation holes placed on cigarettes that you discussed with the jury about how smokers could block them without knowing they were doing so, and you actually marked up a cigarette, or Mr. Gdanski did, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  With respect to those types of holes � of course Lucky Strike didn't have those holes because it didn't have a filter, right?

A.  Well, they did not have them, but actually they could have had them.  In other words, it was not because they didn't have a filter that they didn't have them, they just didn't have them.  In other words, you could have put holes around the end that would have functioned the same way, but they just didn't do that.

Q.  Fair enough.

But Lucky Strike did not have those filter ventilation holes, right?

A.  It did not.

Q.  It did not have those perforations of any type that we've been discussing, right?

A.  Yes � well, they did have � all cigarettes have � are � the cigarette is � is � is � has porosity which functions similar to, but it did not have those extra deceptive ones that some of the later cigarettes had.

A.  Correct.

Q.  Wouldn't you also agree that the Lucky Strike cigarettes smoked by Mr. Shulman, the unfiltered cigarettes, were never marketed as a light cigarette?

A.  That's correct.  I think that's right.

Q.  And wouldn't you agree that the Lucky Strike unfiltered cigarettes smoked by Mr. Shulman were never marketed as a low-tar cigarette?

A.  Yes, I think that � in that period.

Q.  Wouldn't you agree, sir, that you have seen no documents reflecting an agreement between the tobacco companies to develop low-tar or light cigarettes as a health reassurance product?

A.  That's right.  That was not the intent of the conspiracy.  The conspiracy governs how those were made � were marketed, but it does not � it's not involved in the genesis of those.

Q.  You've seen no document reflecting an agreement between R.J. Reynolds, or among any of the companies, saying:  Let's develop low-tar and light cigarettes as a health reassurance product, right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Much like I did for filtered cigarettes yesterday, I want to speak with you very briefly about some of the documents that you have seen during your scholarship, during your scholarly review of the tobacco company documents.

THE COURT:  It doesn't appear that you're going to be able to do this.

MR. GDANSKI:  I think it will be the same, one way or the other, Judge.  Give me a few minutes, if I can just get it done.  Brevity is the soul of wit, so let me try to entertain some wit.

MR. FURR:  No objection. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Can I show these?

Dr. Proctor, I'm not going to go through these the way we did.  Are these examples of the many, many thousands of ads that advertised, promoted, fraudulently, the fact that light and low-tar cigarettes promoted health benefit?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  It's argumentative.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Leading.

health benefit, these advertisements?

A.  They do. Q.  Okay.

A.  They're talking about lowest, the perfect recess.  They are various forms of subtle reassurance.

Q.  One of the things you were asked was about � a question about Mr. Shulman's claims.

You know, Dr. Proctor, there's a claim for punitive damages, and my question to you is: Do these companies need to be punished?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  May we approach?

MR. GDANSKI:  There are claims.

THE COURT:  I'm just going to sustain that objection.  We're taking a lunch break now. I've got an event that I have to go to, unfortunately, so we will not be going late tonight.  We will be done before 5:00 tonight.

We are going to recommence again at 2:00, so if you could be here a couple minutes before 2 so we could start at 2.

(Jury exited courtroom at 11:29 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  See you at 2:00.

MR. FURR:  I do want to move for a mistrial based on that question.

MR. GDANSKI:  Absolutely not.

MR. FURR:  The question � the transcript is clear.  The question in front of jury was asked:  Do these companies need to be punished?  Mr. Gdanski knows that's not a proper subject for expert testimony.  It's just done to be inflammatory and �

THE COURT:  When I get back, I'll give an instruction to the jury of whatever you want me to them to.  It was only a question.

The objection was sustained, and I immediately cut us off to break for lunch, so I think the jury realized that it was not a question that was proper.  I have sustained the objection.

I actually didn't even allow Mr. Gdanski to continue.  All right?

The jury should not consider the question of any value.  It should be completely disregarded.  Nothing that the lawyer says is evidence in the case.  Okay?

The witnesses that testify and the exhibits that are presented are the things that are � that can be evidence in the case.

So I just wanted to make that very clear to the jury since I've been sustaining a lot of objections.  The last objection I sustained.  I wasn't sure if I gave you that instruction.

All right.  Ready to proceed?

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.

May it please the Court.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION, CONTINUING, BY MR. GDANSKI:

Q.  Good afternoon, Dr. Proctor.  A couple questions.  Have you studied the forces that evolved in history?

A.  Of course.

did that start in the 1950s as opposed to some

other objective?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It's not until the 1950s that there's really a serious threat to the cigarette trade as a result of the increasing knowledge of people learning about some of the harms of smoking and actually starting to quit by the millions.

So that's why the conspiracy is formed, to rescue the cigarette which really had not been a problem before that time.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  You discussed the idea of the data on quitting and said about a million a year since 1964?

A.  On average. Q.  On average.

Okay.  If you wanted to explore the depths of that statistic, are people also starting at the same time?

A.  Yes, throughout that time, thousands of people are starting every day.  Nearly 4,000 people start every day; and as a result, you need

people every day are also starting smoking.

Q.  3800 youth start smoking every single

day?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  How many youth start smoking every single day now?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  We need a time frame, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Could you rephrase your question?

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  As best as we're aware from current data, how many youths start smoking every day?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Relevance as to current data.

MR. GDANSKI:  They talked about �

MR. FURR:  Your Honor, we should not argue this in front of the jury.

They went into the fact that the cigarette is a dis- � on its way out and near extinction.  That's present day.  That's into the future, in fact.

Extinction is clearly not distinct. That's into the future.  I can't ask how many youth started smoking today after they asked those questions?

MR. FURR: Your Honor, here's what � this is what you're going to see happen several times today.

Mr. Gdanski, over objection, was permitted to ask certain questions, which I'm going to present to the Court in one minute, we objected to about youth smoking today.  We objected to those.

He was also � Dr. Proctor provided the jury different dates as to when smoking peaked, et cetera.

We objected to all of that.  He was allowed to do it.  We went in to not open the door but to shut the door on that issue, to clarify it, and now he's trying to bootstrap his way in.

Here's what Mr. Gdanski was allowed to

ANSWER:  That's always been true, yes.

So he was � on three separate occasions, he was permitted to talk about youth smoking today.

The only questions we went into on cross were to contextualize how youth smoking has decreased and how it's at a low peak today.

He should not be allowed to bootstrap his way back in to talking about youth smoking evidence today that has no relevance for this 95-year-old plaintiff.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm not sure I understand the objection.  That's exactly what we were asking.  So what Mr. Furr is saying is that I talked about the subject on direct.  He talked about the subject on cross, and now I'm allowed to talk to it on redirect.  That's � what Mr. Furr just laid out is exactly my point.  It's fair game.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And this was the Federal Trade Commission report from 1981, right, Dr. Proctor? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  The impact on the efficacy of the current warning of the advertisements in which it appears was aptly summarized in an advertising age article describing a Christmas advertisement for Marlboro.

It goes on to describe the scenery and the white snow, and I'm not going to read it. There's a cowboy.  A typical Marlboro ad, right? A.  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  The white boxed cancer

warning in the right-hand corner has stained the

snow yellow.  The reflective pleasure of tobacco

pervades the ad.  It unifies the desire for a

perfect Christmas with the experience of smoking.

The Surgeon General has no chance against this.

Do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.  Did the tobacco companies know, were

they on notice during the period of time when they

were denying the health hazards of smoking that

the Surgeon General's message had no chance to

guess the pervasive effect of their advertising?

A.  They certainly could have read this

report.

Q.  Was the imagery and the advertising an

important component of the tobacco company ads?

A.  Imagery is always crucial.

is beyond the scope of any cross-examination.

MR. GDANSKI:  There was so much cross about concealing or not concealing that this can't possibly be beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  In the late 1990s, Philip Morris concealed some of the harms of cigarettes from their own employees by censoring the newsletters, the health insurance newsletters that were sent to every employee, they deliberately excluded those parts which had to do with what to do in case you had a sick child.

The people working at other companies for the same insurance company, they got newsletters that said:  You should not expose a child to secondhand smoke.

But the Philip Morris letters � the newsletters that went to Philip Morris had that part eliminated, and Philip Morris's own employees, therefore, had the truth concealed from them about smoke can harm a child.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, move to strike.  Highly prejudicial.  References to issues you have already sustained objections to.  I can

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, as recently as today, and I don't think it was the first time, you specifically sustained an objection to references to secondhand smoke.

Now in an answer to a question that didn't seem to call for it at all, this witness has now injected into the case that second- � that Philip Morris was trying to conceal the dangers of secondhand smoke to children, nothing to do with anything in this case, and on an issue that you've already said is not germane to the proceedings.

I have no idea why that just came out of his mouth, and I presume Mr. Gdanski had an idea it was going to because the question was kind of odd, but, in any event, Your Honor, it has nothing to do with this case.  It's out of the �

MR. BRENNER:  Yes.  Dr. Proctor, on my low-tar/lights cross, injected secondhand smoke when I said:  If someone doesn't smoke lights, they're obviously not getting hurt by them?

MR. BRENNER:  And you sustained the objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Well, he � he should have a big fight, Your Honor, because you have an order on this saying they can't get into it unless we have a hearing on it.

MR. GDANSKI:  Not � no, I'm right here. I'm asking the Court.  We approached.  I'm going to get into a subject matter about Philip Morris boycotting the Merrell Dow Company and not purchasing chemicals from them because those chemicals were used because Merrell Dow was also putting out Nicorette gum.

supplier to Philip Morris.  That same company

started to put out Nicorette gum.

And Philip Morris said:  If you put out Nicorette gum, we're going to boycott you.

And they did for a while, and the point is that it goes to the heart of the matter that Philip Morris was not doing anything to encourage smokers to quit smoking.

In fact, they were hindering those efforts, and I think that's directly responsive to cross-examination because their cross focused

on �

on this?

MR. GDANSKI:  This specific issue didn't.  This specific Merrell Dow, of course, didn't come up.

But Mr. Furr spent the whole cross about why smokers quit, how they quit, what the social factors and forces were surrounding quitting.

THE COURT:  What does that have to do with the Merrell Dow thing?

MR. GDANSKI:  Because when smokers were quitting, the industry tried to stop them and prevent quitting.  The industry didn't help people quit.  These defendants �

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, he's going to testify to what the answer is.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can't get out a word.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, you might as well approach.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. BRENNER: Your Honor, this same issue came up yesterday, and you sustained an objection to it.

This is the same story with Liggett putting on a warning and Philip Morris taking it off when they bought Chesterfield.

THE COURT:  Didn't we talk about this �

MR. BRENNER:  Yes, of course we did.

There were two different ways they opened the door.

MR. BRENNER:  Nothing, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Does anybody have the transcript from yesterday?

MR. GDANSKI:  I can get the transcript.

MR. EDSON:  I have the entire cross-examination by Liggett here, and I would challenge Mr. Gdanski to point to anything in there that opens the door to this.

THE COURT:  What was in there that opens the door?  Show me that.

MR. EDSON:  What he wants to do is take Liggett talking not about this subject and use it

You want to point out exactly that � you want to make a case against Philip Morris. It's not about Liggett.

MR. GDANSKI:  And RJ Reynolds by implication.

THE COURT:  Just a couple guestions for you.

So you're saying that the fact that they said that the � Liggett has conducted itself differently than the rest of the industry and that they turned over their documents, that that opens the door to what?

MR. GDANSKI:  If Liggett is able to say that they conducted themselves differently from the other defendants, then I am, as a result of that, able to demonstrate how Liggett has conducted itself differently from the other defendants.  I can follow up on that guestion.

The greatest example of Liggett conducting itself differently from the other defendants is the unigue moment in time where Liggett did something, one of � which was a positive thing.  Another defendant � which they put on their cigarette pack:  Smoking is

Another defendant bought that brand, and now this other defendant behaved differently. It's directly spot on �

THE COURT:  Okay.  But they didn't open up the door to the second part of it.

MR. BRENNER:  Correct.

THE COURT:  They opened up the door to the first part.

So you can get into the fact that Liggett put a warning label on there in advance of the other industry, but you cannot get into � this does not open up the door to the removal of the label �

MR. BRENNER:  Correct.

THE COURT:  � once it was purchased by his client because his client did not open up the door to that.

MR. EDSON:  Your Honor, I don't think � I don't think you can even do that.

THE COURT:  Yes, you may. MR. GDANSKI:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, you know that the company Liggett used to make and manufacture the brand Chesterfield? A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And is Liggett, when they made this brand, the only company ever to voluntarily put on a warning on a cigarette pack that says:  Smoking is addictive?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Preemption, Your Honor.

Your Honor, I think �

MR. GDANSKI:  Just take it off for a

second.

THE COURT:  Overruled

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Go ahead.

A.  That's correct.  That was the only company to say cigarettes are addictive.

picture of the front pack that we're showing here,

Chesterfields on the front that says:  Warning �

Chesterfields, when it was made by Liggett, that

said:  Smoking is addictive?

A.  It is, from the late '90s.

Q.  Okay.  Does Liggett still make and

manufacture the brand Chesterfield?

A.  No.

Q.  Now Council for Tobacco Research, we

looked at that.  Do they even exist anymore, CTR?

A.  No.

A.  Well, they were disbanded by court order at the end of the '90s.

Q.  All right.  Mr. Furr went through three scientists who during the entire course of the history of the CTR wrote articles that had some implication that smoking is bad, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How does that really demonstrate anything in the totality of the situation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What's the significance of the fact, understanding the totality of the circumstances, that only three scientists were able to have been demonstrated to have said something that smoking might cause disease?

A.  Well, there's exceptions to the rule. There's � as I mentioned, there were 7,000 published articles funded by the TIRO, CTR, and only a handful actually found any harm whatsoever, and I described that as leakage in the conspiracy.

proved what Mr. Furr wrote here:  Smoking causes

lung cancer?

A.  No, they never said that.

Q.  Was there ever any CTR-funded studies ever that concluded smoking causes COPD?

A.  I don't think those exact words appear in any of the studies.

Q.  Was there ever any CTR-funded studies that proved and said smoking is addictive?

A.  Very, very rarely, if ever.  There are few that mention the word "addiction" but it's rare.

Q.  And what happened to the other studies, Dr. Proctor, where other scientists who were doing studies that did say things like that, were they defunded?

A.  Yes, the pattern of the funding was that if you did find evidence of harm and published it, your funding could be cut off.

Q. This book, Mr. Furr referenced it: The Premier Eclipse, a Cigarette Prototype That Heat Instead of Burn Tobacco?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is this tobacco propaganda?

A.  It is.

Q.  The heat, not burn �

A.  It doesn't include the full truth. Q.  The heat, not burn products, the Premier and Eclipse, you're familiar with historical data that demonstrated that those products contain higher levels of carbon monoxide, cancer-causing carbon monoxide than ordinary regular cigarettes, right ?

A.  Yes, in other words, while they reduced some carcinogens, they actually increased other places.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Nonresponsive to the guestion, Your Honor.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's completely responsive.

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.

Overruled. Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  And when Reynolds sold the heat, not burn, Premier and Eclipse products, did they also leave the defective and unreasonably dangerous �

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Argumentative. Defective and unreasonably dangerous.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's a finding.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Are cigarettes

defective and unreasonably dangerous?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  That calls for a legal conclusion, Your Honor.  That's not proper.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's a finding. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  You're familiar with the Engle findings?

A.  More or less.

Q.  I'd like you to assume that there's an Engle finding that the jury will be instructed about from the Florida Supreme Court from the Engle jury that says cigarettes are defective and unreasonably dangerous, okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  When Reynolds put out the Premier and Eclipse, did they remove the ordinary defective Camel cigarettes?

A.  No, they left those on the market. That's part of the problem.

Q.  And one of the things you talked about was � with Mr. Furr, that when Reynolds claimed or if they did make claims, and I think

A.  I've heard that, yes. Q.  Has Reynolds, when confronted with circumstances where Reynolds, by that same agency or entity, is making claims that cigarettes are a certain type or maybe they've changed in the design and someone says:  You can't sell those cigarettes, has Reynolds sued?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.  Beyond the scope of any cross-examination.

MR. GDANSKI:  He asked about Reynolds getting sued.

The fact that Reynolds has exercised its First Amendment right to petition us for relief when they think cigarettes are being treated unlawfully �

THE COURT:  I'm not sure how one has to do with the other.

MR. GDANSKI:  It's the corollary.  In other words, Reynolds says something's safer, someone sues them.  That's in evidence from Mr. Furr.

The corollary of it, the flip side of it is, the public health community says something is not safer, don't sell it, Reynolds sues them.

MR. FURR:  Here's why they're not the same, Your Honor.  The reason that I asked Dr. Proctor about that question is there was an abundance of testimony from Dr. Proctor to the effect � I don't even know what the testimony was � to the effect that �

He talked about that at length.  I asked a simple question of:  Now Reynolds got sued when they tried to say Premier was safer.

So that was all in play by virtue of Dr. Proctor's testimony.  This issue that Mr. Gdanski wants to do has absolutely nothing to do with any issue in the case.  It's completely irrelevant.  And to the extent there's any relevance, it's overly prejudicial under 403.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  Dr. Proctor, you mentioned that, you know, cigarettes are a horse-and-buggy technology.

Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And that you anticipate � I think someone used the word "extinction."  I don't know if you or Mr. Furr used that word.

Is there still a cigarette tobacco epidemic in this country?

A.  There is.  There's still 40 million smokers.  There's still 270 billion cigarettes smoked every year just in this country.  So the epidemic has by no means disappeared.

Q.  Is it disappearing at a rapid rate?

A.  It's going down, but it's falling from an enormous height, so it's still quite high.

Q.  Are cigarettes, are they morbid?

A.  Pardon me?

Q.  Are they dead, are they gone, you know, they're not sold?

A.  They're not gone.  270 billion are sold

renormalize cigarettes?

They stand up here and spend days talking about the normalization of smoking in our society.

MR. GDANSKI:  Mr. Furr �

MR. HAMMER:  One second.

Here's the problem, Judge, is that when we objected to this line of questioning, you said: You can bring it up on redirect.

So now we're trying to do that, and we're being blocked by the objections.

THE COURT:  I think that if you went into the denormalization, I don't know why they can't go back into the renormalization.  It seems like it's fair game.  So I'll overrule it.

Page 5316 Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  What are the tobacco

companies trying to do now to renormalize

cigarettes and smoking in culture?

A.  Well, there are still billions of dollars spent every year on cigarette marketing and promotion, and much of that does involve this effort to renormalize smoking, make it, you know, still seem cool or attractive to smoke.

Q.  Are they still trying to do everything they can to sell as many cigarettes as possible?

A.  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. GDANSKI)  As to ammonia, let's be clear about it.  Does ammonia make a more powerful impact of nicotine on the brain?

Page 5319 video deposition of Dr. Jack Henningfield.  We

have that ready to go.

I believe that Your Honor needs to rule on one objection that the defendants have to some of the testimony.

THE COURT:  So you need me to approach?

MR. GDANSKI:  We can do it in 30 seconds at the side.  Maybe I spoke too soon.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

MR. GUEST:  Do you have a clean one?

MR. GDANSKI:  I cleaned it up a bit.

Can I borrow your highlighter again?

MR. GUEST:  While Mr. Gdanski is doing that, this will be really brief.  Dr. Henningfield is some kind of pharmacologist that deals in issues of addiction, and that's what the bulk of this deposition is.

It's on general addiction issues, and the objection to what Mr. Gdanski is highlighting right now is that it has to do with internal tobacco company topics, which is not the subject of the generic opinions that he's giving in this video deposition.

companies

And it's also cumulative of the witness

who just spent seven days testifying, has already provided it to the jury.

THE COURT:  So what's objectionable is the stuff that's highlighted?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's what they're objecting to.

THE COURT:  This yellow stuff?

MR. GDANSKI:  Just those � that one � those two questions and answers.

MR. GUEST:  And the first one as well. It's actually all three of them.

THE COURT:  What is yellow; am I correct?

MR. GUEST:  And actually everything �

THE COURT:  Make everything yellow for me .

MR. GUEST:  It should be yellow.

MR. GDANSKI:  Starting from where, here (indicating)?

MR. GUEST:  Yeah.

MR. GUEST:  Yes, sir.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, in yellow, Judge. (Counsel conferring.)

MR. GDANSKI:  Did you hear what I said? (Counsel conferring.)

MR. GDANSKI:  He � I can't help but overhear you, I'm sorry.  I can answer the question.

THE COURT:  Well, why don't you just state your position.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah.  My position is that it should be appropriate because Dr. Henningfield has intimate knowledge of the internal tobacco company documents and is able to meld together, from an addiction expert psychopharmacology point of view, or pharmacologist's point of view, the impact that what the industry knew had on smokers and smoking behavior.

He's the former head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and someone who has testified many times regarding the tobacco company documents.

It's in this deposition.  We're just not

of Dr. Proctor to go through the documents again

on addiction.

THE COURT:  Then why isn't this cumulative?

MR. GDANSKI:  That's not cumulative because this talks about actually from the addictive � addiction expert's point of view.  In other words, Dr. Proctor is not an addiction expert.

THE COURT:  All right.  And so let me ask you � I mean, I think I did sustain some objections on the defense's part about when Dr. Proctor did try to go into addiction.

So the question is: Why, when this witness, if he's capable of � my concern was whether he had the knowledge.

But assuming he is qualified, why wouldn't he give those opinions that Dr. Proctor wasn't capable of giving?

MR. GUEST:  I think a two-part answer. Number one, if Mr. Gdanski is trying to say that: Hey, Dr. Henningfield, knew a review of the internal documents, is relevant to your opinions on addiction, which would be the first question

Page 5323 highlighted, fine.  No problem with that if that's

all they're going to get in.

With respect to the second and third questions that are highlighted, that's primarily my problem because it relates to a speculative opinion as to what those internal documents, had they have been disclosed, would have had on the smokers who received that information.

Moreover, it's speculative and cumulative as to what it could have done to their smoking decisions.

So, like I said, first question highlighted, fine.  Primary objection is to two and three.

MR. GDANSKI:  Just the opposite.  He's talking generally how information affects smokers and the addictive process.

THE COURT: Well, what's � 2 just says: Are they important to you on whether smokers truly are making an informed choice?

Yes.

Then � that's a predicate question.

Then Number 3:  Based on your review of all these documents, everything that you've relied on in the case, do you believe smokers from the

informed choices about the product?

MR. GUEST:  And the issue here, Your Honor, is that the internal documents that Dr. Henningfield reviewed somehow informed him with respect to formulating his expert opinions on addiction, that's one thing.

But Dr. Henningfield certainly has no basis for opining that the release of certain documents, or whatever these documents are that Dr. Henningfield has in his mind during this question, would have led other people to have truly made an informed choice is completely speculative.

I mean, I don't even know how he can opine on that.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, I'm just waiting on the ruling because you said that Dr. Proctor was � some objections were sustained on some addiction �

THE COURT:  I think some of them were.

MR. BRENNER:  Yeah.  Some of them were not sustained.  In fact, we went through ad nauseam about them.

Dr. Proctor talked about for at least three

different days, saying that � I mean, he gave all

these opinions.

The documents, they're trying to give smokers a psychological crutch; it keeps addicted smokers.

But Dr. Proctor wasn't included because we were trying to get a medical opinion on addiction.

Dr. Henningfield can give � he gives a lot of other stuff that Dr. Proctor � and that particular question is just beyond � he has no expertise, frankly, to give, and Dr. Proctor �

THE COURT:  Why is it beyond his expertise?

MR. BRENNER:  He's a pharmacologist.  He can't say what an individual � what some unknown individual would do or not do.

MR. GUEST:  With information that �

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, he's not speaking about a specific individual.  He's talking generally about smoking behaviors as a whole.

Of course, he can talk about that.  They crossed the avenue just like they did to

specific smoker.  You don't know what they saw,

what they read, if they were or were not addicted,

how much they smoked, et cetera.

But as a pharmacologist, he can talk about the population of smokers � and this is the former head of the National Institute of Drug Abuse � as a whole, which he's treated.  He's treats the population as a whole.

The head of NIDA doesn't treat one smoker.  He treats � he essentially is mandating and, you know, regulating the position of the government on drugs of abuse, like nicotine, for the entire population.

So he studies it.  That's actually what that question goes to.

MR. GUEST:  But that certainly does not qualify him to say:  Hey, do you believe that smokers in general � and he certainly hasn't treated all smokers in general � would have been truly informed in making their decisions had they had this information?

I mean, that's just speculative.  And to Mr. Gdanski's point, Dr. Proctor was able to testify that had this information been put out

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

THE COURT:  So what's the timing in terms of � how many more witnesses do you guys have?

MR. BRENNER:  That's a great question. I was going to ask the same one.

MR. GDANSKI:  Four, five.  I'm not sure.

THE COURT:  Wow.  I mean, the big problem that we're going to run into is that it's not the Court's time � and I can probably reshuffle things.

It's the � there are certain jurors we might lose if we start running over what we estimated to them.

That's what my biggest concern is.  So I hope you're not planning to have ad nauseam, you know, where you're going to go seven days with another witness �

MR. GDANSKI:  I think �

THE COURT:  � because we spent so much time with one witness that you're putting us in jeopardy, because what's going to happen is, it's not me.  The jurors are already asking questions about it.

The jurors are concerned about the time

So they're starting to get concerned about those things, and you guys are going to be having to become lots more � very efficient with your questions.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

MR. BRENNER:  I would just say that we raised this � our concern, as I'm sure you would be sensitive to and probably have thought about already, is where we don't want to be is the defense case getting squeezed.  I have tried to figure out the plaintiff's case.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. BRENNER:  I can see them resting no chance before � the earliest would be the day before Veteran's Day.

And if Mr. Gdanski says they have four or five witnesses, it's the day after.  Judge, that's a problem.  We have five experts.
