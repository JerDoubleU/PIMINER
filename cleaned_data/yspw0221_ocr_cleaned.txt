	A.   Yes, I do.                                 |

2
	Q.   And based on our discussion of Dr. Colby

3
	yesterday, you at one point mentioned that he was a   l

4
	librarian for Reynolds?                               \

5
	A �    In 0 �   1 QOn t DSllcVc 1 S31Q 116 WSS 9

	librarian.  I said he was in charge of our

7
	scientific iiorary, our lnrornidtion area.

8
	Q.   You said he was in charge of the library.

9
	A.   Yes.

10
	Q,   So what you're telling us is that he was    j

11
	not heavily involved in matters related to smoking

12
	and health within R.J. Reynolds?                    j

13
	A.  My understanding is he was responsible     \

14
	for maintaining literature that was becoming

15
	available in our scientific library; and some of     j

16
	that literature was related to smoking and health,    |

17
	yes.                                             \

18
	Q.   But he was not responsible for advising     j

19
	management regarding issues related to smoking and

20
	health?                                       j

21
	A.   I don't know all of his responsibilities,   j

22
	but that's not my understanding.

23
	Q.   And he would not have been -- let's say

24
	in the early 1980s, he would not have been the

25  person with the most knowledge regarding issues      I

3        A.   I'm not sure I would know who would have

4   been the person that was most knowledgeable at that

5   point in time.

6        Q.  But you don't think it would have been

7   him?

8        A,   I don't know that it would have been, no.

9        Q.  And he was not an influential person

10   within the company on the subject of smoking and

11   health, as far as you understand it?

12        A.   I think that he was a member of the

13   research and development department; he was

14   responsible for our information sciences area, for

15   our library; that he was a scientist by training.

16   So that's my understanding of his role.

17        Q.   Well, so you think � you believe that he

18   was influential in terms of his advice and

19   recommendations regarding issues related to smoking

20   and health? ai       a.   i m nor. sure exacriy wnac. you mean JDy

22   "influential."  I think that he may have expressed

23   opinions from time to time.  I'm not sure if they

24   did or didn't have influence.  It would depend upon

25   the particular situation, I would expect.

1        Q.   You recognize that individuals who work

2   for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company from time to

3   time are required to appear for depositions?

4        A.  Yes, I understand that they have.

5        Q.  And you know that R.J. Reynolds can

6   propose witnesses for depositions � or designate

7   witnesses, rather, for depositions, who

8   R.J. Reynolds believes to be the person with the

9   most knowledge regarding certain issues, correct?

10        A.   I'm not a lawyer, but I believe � I

11   mean, I understand that there are times they're

12   designated, yes.

13        Q.   And do you know if Dr. Colby has ever

14   been designated as a person with the most knowledge

15   regarding issues related to smoking and health at

16   R.J. Reynolds?

17        A.   No, I don't.

3   Are there changes in potential measures of effect?

4             So there are things that would look at

1        Q.   When is the last time you spoke with

2   either Dr. Teague, Dr. Rodgman, or Dr. Senkus? And

3   that's Dr. Alan Rodgman, right?

5             I don't recall the exact dates.  I don't

6   know that I've spoken to Dr. Teague in many, many /       years.  Definitely not since ne leir r. n e company.

8             In terms of Dr. Rodgman, oh, it's been

9   within the last year that I've spoken with

10   Dr. Rodgman.

11             In terms of Dr. Senkus, it probably would

12   go back -- it could be as much as four or five

13   years ago now.

14        Q.   And under what circumstances did you see

15   Dr. Rodgman recently?

16        A.   I don't recall the exact time, the last

17   time that we met; but it probably was in regards

18   to � he may have been looking for scientific

19   literature.  He, along with another former

20   colleague, published a very large book on all of

21   the constituents that have been identified in

22   tobacco and tobacco smoke.

23             So it probably was with regard to his

24   work in that area, my congratulating him on having

25   won an award recognizing that contribution to the

1   science.  So within the last year or so.

2        Q.   Dr. Rodgman is well thought of within the

3   company?

4        A.   I believe generally so.  I can't speak

5   for everyone.  I mean, different people may have

6   different opinions; but I believe generally so,

7   yes.

8        Q.  There are photographs of him, that if

9   somebody were to take a tour of the facilities they

10   would see photographs of Dr. Rodgman,

11        A.   I don't believe that's true, no.

12        Q.   No? No photographs of Dr. Senkus?

13        A.   When you tour our facilities � first of

14   all, there generally aren't tours of the facility.

15   It's not open to the public, as such.  But if there

16   were to be a tour for a new employee, for example,

17   there wouldn't be pictures of those sorts of

18   individuals.  They would be � they would be taken

19   through the research and development department,

20   and some of the key operations would be described.

21        Q.   You're saying if I was given access to

22   freely walk through the R.J. Reynolds facilities

23   and buildings, you're telling me that there would

24   be no pictures that would be displayed portraying

25   either Dr. Rodgman or Dr. Senkus?

1        A.  None come to mind.  I don't believe so,

2   no.

3        Q.   Okay.  And do you know if Dr. Rodgman or

4   Dr. Senkus were recognized internally within the

5   company for their work over the years?

6        A.   I don't know exactly what you mean by

7   that, but I'm sure their work was recognized in

8   various ways throughout the years; one leading the

9   department, the other a scientist, and then a

10   manager in later years.

11        Q.   Do you know if they won any internal like

12   R.J. Reynolds awards or anything like that?

13        A.   I don't know their history in that

14   regard.  I don't know if they've won any awards or

15   not.

16        Q.   Do you know if Dr. Teague won any

17   internal R.J. Reynolds awards or recognitions

18   regarding his work during his employment?

19        A.   I don't know.

20        Q.   You don't know if either Dr. Teague,

21   Dr. Rodgman, or Dr. Senkus were given any sort of

22   honors by R.J. Reynolds related to their work and

23   employment with the company?

1        Q.   This was something we touched on

2   yesterday a little bit, but I just want to make

4             It's your testimony that -- well, let me

5   back up for a second.

g                            R.J. -- scientists and managers who may

7   also be scientists in the company, especially those

8   who work in research and development, over the

9   years have talked internally in memorandums about iu       issues reiareo. to s mo .King a n o. n e a l m *  Am i

11   correct?

12        A.   I don't recall that being my testimony.

13             But in terms of science in general, we

14   have many discussions about science.  When a

15   scientific paper comes out, two colleagues may

16   discuss whatever it has to say.  That's not

17   generally, I would say, in the form of a memo; in

18   that it's more of a dialogue about what are the

19   findings in the paper? What date is in the paper?

20   What might you think of the paper? That's what I

21   was trying to communicate to you, if I recall.

22        Q,  But there are discussions that might end

23   up being documented in paper form; whether you want

24   to call it a memorandum, a correspondence, a

25   communication, but discussions that are ultimately

1   put to paper?

2        A.   I don't believe that I would generally

3   agree with that characterization.  That wasn*t what

4   I was trying to suggest yesterday.  Oftentimes for

5   a project at the end of the project the results of

6   it are documented, actions and plans at times

7   are � for a particular study are put forward.

8             But as far as dialogue discourse, that's

9   not generally just committed to paper.

10        Q.   I didn't say it was just committed to

11   paper.  I asked you if there were times when issues

12   related to smoking and health were committed to

13   paper.

14        A.   I'm not sure exactly what you mean by

15   that.

16        Q.   Well, let's just look at Plaintiffs'

17   Exhibit 18.  This is a document that we discussed

18   yesterday authored by Dr. league and directed to

10        A.   It is.

11        Q.   And it's in R.J. Reynolds* library of

12   documents, correct?

13        A.   Yes.  This is an invention disclosure, so

14   it's in the patent area.

15        Q.  And this was communicated to others in

16   the company, correct?

17        A.   As an idea, yes.

1   that are documented.  In this case it's an

2   invention disclosure; not an idea, as far as an

3   abstract idea, but an execution of something as an

4   idea.

5        Q.   Well, I mean, if you really want to talk

6   about this document, it's more than an idea.  It's

7   actually Dr. Teague having a discussion with his

8   superiors regarding the misperception � strike

10             It's more than just a discussion.  It is

11   an idea rather.  It is Dr. Teague discussing with

12   his supervisors the public's misunderstanding that

13   the change in filter color had something to do with

14   how effective the filter was in removing elements

15   from the smoke, right?

16             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17        A.   I wouldn't agree with that

18   characterization.

20        Q.   All right.  And it was also Dr. Teague

1   yesterday.  I can tell you about this category of

2   document.  It's about a way to capture potential

3   ideas.

4   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

5        Q.   All right.  So when R.J. Reynolds would

6   discuss their positions on smoking and health �

7   for example, whether or not there was sufficient

8   proof to come to the conclusion that smoking

9   cigarettes was the cause of any disease, including

10   lung cancer -- they would maintain consistent

11   public positions on the same issue at all times,

13        A.   No.  I don't think I would agree with

14   that.

15        Q.   So they would say something internally

16   but then turn around and say something different

17   publicly?

18        A.   No.  I think you're mischaracterizing the

19   purpose of this document.

20        Q.   I'm not talking about this document

21   anymore, Doctor.

22             I'm asking you if the R.J. Reynolds

23   Tobacco Company would maintain consistent positions

24   on issues related to smoking and health; for

25   example, on whether or not there was sufficient

1   proof to make the conclusion that smoking

2   cigarettes was the cause of lung cancer or other

3   diseases, they would not make an inconsistent

4   position publicly?

5        A.   If I followed your question, I think the

6   answer is no, in that Reynolds* views have changed

7   over time.  Their positions have changed over time

8   as more science has evolved.

9        Q.   You're not answering my question, Doctor.

10        A.   I'm trying my best.  I'm not sure I

11   understood it.

12        Q.   I didn't ask you if their positions have

13   changed over time.

14             I asked you whether they would discuss

15   something internally and take a position, and then

16   go public and take the opposite position?

17             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18        A.   My answer is no.

19   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

20        Q.   Okay.  So they would at all times

6   issue?

7             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form.

8        A.   They would put forward their views in a

9   straightforward way.  Their views were what their

10   views were.  And parallel to that there was

11   evolving science, there was discussion of science.

12   As science developed their views changed.

19             When R.J. Reynolds would talk internally

3   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

4        Q.   Okay.  For example, let's say in 1968

5   R.J. Reynolds was talking internally about their

6   position on whether or not smoking cigarettes was

7   the cause of any disease.  Okay? Do you understand

8   that?

10        Q.  Would they then at that time maintain the

11   same position if they were to speak publicly on the

12   same matter?

13             MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.

19             If, for example, in 1968 the

20   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, scientists and

21   executives and managers, discussed internally what

22   their position was on issues related to smoking and

2        A.   The position would be the position.  It

3   would be a single position.  Scientists having

4   discussions inside are not "the company."  They're

5   individual scientists.  Part of that contributes to

6   the ultimate understanding and position.  The

7   company's position would have been the company's

10        A.   I don't know that I can speak � you're

11   speaking in very absolute terms, and you're trying

12   to confuse a company with a number of individuals.

13   Individuals have views.  They look at all of the

14   science together � in the case of a scientific

15   question � and a consensus develops.  If that

16   science then informs a company position, then the

16        A.   I'm trying to understand it, sir.

17        Q.   Well, you understand � I mean, as a

18   scientist, as someone who works at a tobacco

19   company in research and development, you understand

20   the term "hazard."  I mean, that's not dif"fi.CUit

21   for you to comprehend, right?

22        A.   I understand hazard, yes.

23        Q.  Okay.  And you understand the concept of

24   a product being dangerous to the user, correct?

1        Q.   So my question is, if a � if it is true

2   that there is no scientific proof that a particular

3   product is hazardous to the user, it would also

4   have to be true that there is no proof that that

5   product poses a danger to the health of the user,

6   correct?

7             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form.

8        A.   If I follow your question, I believe that

9   in the absence of any proof, it's not known that it

10   is hazardous.  That doesn't mean there's still not

11   the risk that it's hazardous; it's just that the

12   proof is not available.  Even when facts are

14   new science will evolve or emerge and the facts are

18   definitive data that is proof of something, there

1        A.   No.  Risk can actually have a continuum

2   to it, and there's always risk that even what

3   have opinions regarding the cigarette brands that

6   aspects of the brands, about the cigarettes

7   themselves, about their design, about where in the

8   evolution of cigarette designs they may fit.  So it

9   would be about the products themselves.

10        Q.   Right.  What I'm trying to figure out is,

11   you know, at this time are there any specific

12   opinions you have regarding the cigarette brands

13   that she smoked as indicated in the disclosure?

14        A.   My only opinions would be around the

15   products themselves, in terms of the various design

16   technologies that were included in those products

17   at those points in time.  They would be about the

18   products specifically themselves.

19        Q.  What does that mean?

20        A.   Well, depending upon the particular

21   cigarette brand, it would be about the design

22   technologies in that brand styles.

23        Q.   What does that mean, though, "design

7        Q.   Did all of the cigarettes that

8   Karen Whitney smoked contain reconstituted tobacco

9   that were manufactured by a Reynolds company?

10        A.   I believe so, yes.

11        Q.  Okay.  Were all of the cigarettes that

12   Karen Whitney smoked, did they contain

13   reconstituted tobacco including the ones that may

14   have been manufactured by either a Brown &

15   Williamson or an American Tobacco company?

16        A.   I believe so, yes.

18   that the cigarettes that she smoked manufactured by

19   Philip Morris did not contain reconstituted

20   tobacco?

1        A.   As far as that process, as a consequence

2   of that process, there is some nicotine lost, yes,

3        Q.   You can � you can remove all of the

4   nicotine in that process?

5        A.   It's not a nicotine-removal process.  It

6   would be all of the water soluble parts of tobacco.

7        Q,  Right.  And that process can remove all

8   of the nicotine, correct?

9        A.  Well, as part of all the water solubles,

10   everything including nicotine would be removed as

11   part of the processing and then would be reapplied

12   as part of forming the final tobacco.

13        Q.   And then who reapplies that water soluble

14   that contains nicotine?

15        A.   It's part of the actual process.  When

16   the two are separated, you no longer have with one

17   single part, the tobacco.  The tobacco is in two

18   parts.  It'd be in a pulp, a paper-like material,

19   and all of the water solubles.

20             So you've separated the tobacco into

21   those two parts in order to ultimately make a

22   tobacco sheet and be able to make it into tobacco

23   pieces.

7   spread on the pulp, correct?

9   as a decision.  It's part of just reapplying,

12   as to how to apply that water soluble material

13   containing nicotine onto the pulp?

14        A.   If by "decision" you mean is it a

15   technical step, it's one of the steps in the

16   process.

17        Q.   So obviously a decision had to be made on

18   that technical step, right?

5   one of the � the other part of it that you said

10   paper sheet in a way -- and the water solubles are

9   capability to do that, as far as the technical

10   capability in place; but conceptually we know how

11   to do iti yes.

12        Q.   Okay.  So it's your testimony that

13   today � as we sit here today, R.J. Reynolds

14   doesn't have the technical capability of removing

15   nicotine from tobacco?

16        A.   Not in the quantities that would supply

17   tobacco for the cigarettes that we manufacture, I

18   don't believe so, no.

19        Q.   And whose decision is that?

20        A.   I don't know that it's a decision as

21   such.

18             When did the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

20   they manufactured and sold to the public were

21   addictive, caused addiction?

22             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

23        A.   Again, I'm not sure how you would be

24   defining "addiction."

1   addiction, addiction today would be something that

2   someone can do for a long period of time, may have

3   difficulty in quitting and so on.  I think Reynolds

4   has known that cigarette smoking can be difficult

5   to quit for many decades.

6        Q.  When?

7        A.   I don't know the exact date.  But I think

8   as far as the current definition of addiction, it's

9   changed over time.  I think that clearly it changed

10   in more recent years.  By that definition, I think

11   that Reynolds has held that view for a number of

12   years now.

13        Q.  What view and when are you talking about?

14        A.   I'm talking about probably around the

15   year 2000 or so on, for example.  It would have

16   been communicated on our website in the early

17   2000s.  As far as the definition changing, it would

18   have changed in the 1980s.

19        Q.   But in terms of Reynolds coming � coming

20   forth publicly using that terminology, "addiction,"

21   you think that it would have come out for the first

22   time in the early 2000s?

23        A.   I believe so.  I think that Reynolds'

24   scientists, for example, published in the area; and

25   at that time the publications indicated that based

1   upon the '64 definition of the Surgeon General, in

2   terms of nicotine and smoking being habituating,

3   those scientists agreed with that and they stated

4   the reasons that they did not believe that it met

5   the other definition that was coming forth at that

6   time.

7             So the views changed over time.  Today we

8   say that nicotine in tobacco and tobacco smoke is

9   addictive.

10        Q.   Okay.  And we talked about yesterday that

11   the � well, strike that.

12             Earlier, just a few minutes ago, when I

13   asked you about addiction you started talking about

14   difficulty quitting.

15             Is it your � do you think the definition

16   of addiction is "difficulty quitting"?

8   difficulty of quitting?

9        A.   That is not my entire definition of it,

10   no.  That would be one part of what I believe the

11   public generally considers something addictive to

13        Q.   So the fact that something is difficult

14   to quit, that does not mean it is addictive?

15        A.   Not necessarily.  And if I may, what I

16   said earlier was "may be difficult to quit."

17        Q.   Okay.  Do you think heroin is addictive?

18        A.   I believe that it is, yes.

9   cancer."

10             So is that Dr. Senkus acknowledging that

11   cigarette smoking poses a risk to the smoker?

12        A.  My view is informed by much more than

13   this one document.  He expressed his view there;

14   you've read what he indicated in this document.

15   I'm also aware of the actions that the department

16   took,

17        Q.   The cigarettes that R.J, Reynolds

18   manufactured in the early 1900s, for example when

20   and those cigarettes caused cancer, correct?

21        A.   I believe that in some individuals that

22   smoking would have caused cancer potentially, yes.

23        Q.   You say "in some individuals."  Is that

24   the guiding principle that's stated on your

25   company's website, that in some individuals smoking

1   cigarettes causes lung cancer?

2        A.  No, that's not the guiding principle.

3   But I'm giving you my understanding of the facts,

4   and that not everyone that smokes develops lung

6        Q.   Right.  But are you saying that you

7   disagree with R.J. Reynolds' current guiding

8   principle that cigarette smoking causes lung

9   cancer?

10        A.   No.

11        Q.   Okay.  But you like to qualify it with

12   "cigarette smoking causes lung cancer in some

13   people. "

14        A.   Again, these are the facts of the matter,

16        Q.   Okay.  So the cigarettes that

17   R.J. Reynolds manufactured back in let's say 1913,

18   you agree that those cigarettes caused cancer?

19        A.   Again, because they generated smoke, the

20   complex mixture, I think it's possible in some

21   individuals.  That's my opinion.

22        Q.   It's possible that they could cause

23   cancer in 1913?

25       Q.   Okay.  The cigarettes that R.J. Reynolds

1   manufactured in the early 1960s when Karen Whitney

2   was a teenager, did those cigarettes cause cancer?

3        A.  Again, all cigarettes � there are no �

4   there's no cigarette that's absolutely safe;

5   there's a risk with all cigarettes.  And yes, it's

6   possible that for some individuals that those /       cigarettes may nave ueen une principal cause oi

8   cancer.

9        Q.  And the cigarettes that R.J. Reynolds

10   manufactured, including the ones that Karen Whitney

11   smoked from when she was a teenager until two

12   thousand -- let's say the middle of 2008 � those

13   cigarettes caused cancer?

14        A.   Again, my answer would be much the same.

15   It's possible in some individuals.  It's one of

16   many factors that may have contributed depending

17   upon the individual.

18        Q.   Okay.  And what year did R.J. Reynolds

19   learn that smoking cigarettes was actually a cause

20   of lung cancer?

21        A.   In terms of the information around

22   mechanism, I think a lot of that information has

23   become available scientifically in the middle 1990s

24   to 2005 or so, a tremendous number of studies and

25   literature in that regard.  So I think that the

2   a view of the mechanism.

3             It's also clear that there's much

4   research to be done yet, that it's not complete

5   overall.  But I think that the science and the

6   company's views evolved in the mid to late 1990s in

7   that regard, and there was a lot more known about

8   mechanism.

9        Q.   Okay.  And when they learned for the

10   first time in the mid 1990s to 2005 that smoking

11   was the cause of lung cancer, did they stop

12   advertising light cigarettes?

13             That's my question, Doctor.  Did they

14   stop advertising light cigarettes during that time

15   period?

16        A.   Not to my knowledge, no.  There would

17   have been light cigarettes available during that      �

18   time.

19        Q.   Right.  They didn't actually stop

20   marketing and advertising light cigarettes until

21   2010, correct?

22        A.   I don't recall the exact year; but

23   roughly in that time frame, yes.

24        Q.   And the only reason they did it then was    | g

-J

25   because they were required to stop doing it?                       J �

1                        ri .     IGS �

2        Q.   This is where I was trying to fall back

3   to a minute ago.  We were talking about when the

4   company became aware that their product was

5   addictive, and you said that � I believe you said

6   since the early 2000s they've indicated on their

7   website that smoking cigarettes is addictive,

8   correct?

a.   i oeiieve so, yes.

10        Q.   Prior to the early 2000s, are you aware

11   of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company making that �

12   strike that.

13             Is the statement "smoking cigarettes" --

14   "Cigarette smoking is addictive," is that a guiding   |

15   principle of R.J. Reynolds?

16        A.   It's currently a guiding principle and

17   belief that nicotine in tobacco and cigarette smoke

18   is addictive, yes.

19        Q.   Okay.  And prior to the early 2000s, did

20   the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company make that public

21   statement, that guiding principle publicly?

22        A.   No.  There were � there was much

23   presented publicly; but I think generally the

24   scientists had the view that it was something that

25   was defined as a habit, a habitual behavior, along

Ca) CO

1   the lines of the 1964 Surgeon General's report.

2        Q.   So prior to the early 2000s, the

3   collective conclusion of the scientists who work at

4   the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was that

5   cigarette smoking is not addictive; it may be

6   habit-forming, but it is not an addiction?

7        A,   Yes.  I think the scientists that worked

8   in that area, that was their view and they

9   published that.

10        Q.   And once they learned � once

11   R.J. Reynolds learned that cigarette smoking was

12   addictive, did they stop marketing light

13       cicrarettes

14        A.   Light cigarettes continued until the time   |

15   frame that we discussed just a few moments ago.

16        Q.  Okay.  One of the things we talked about

17   yesterday was the reasonableness of the public's

18   perceptions of whether or not filtered cigarettes

19   made the cigarettes safer.  Do you remember that

20   discussion?

21        A.   Generally, yes.

22        Q.   Okay.

23             (Plaintiffs' Deposition Exhibit 22 was

24   marked for identification.)

23        Q.   Okay.  And then if you move to the

8   attributable to R.J. Reynolds?

9             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form.

10        A,   Again, as I said yesterday, I think

11   R.J. Reynolds has made its views known.  In terms

4   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

5        Q.  As a result of that litigation?

6        A.   I believe it may have been related to

7   that.  I don't know the details exactly.

9   in that litigation, the conspiracy between the xu       i\.u . Ksynoius xooacco L/Ompany ano "cne xooacco

16   area, yes.

11   permitted to state publicly that filtered or light

12   cigarettes are safer, meaning producing less risk

1   One that's not protonated.

2        Q.   And what does that mean?

3        A.   Well, nicotine is a molecule that can

4   either be in a nonprotonated, a monoprotonated, or

5   a diprotonated form from a chemistry standpoint.

6   So it can exist either as an organic molecule or as

7   a salt.  The salt would be one that would be a

8   protonated form.

9        Q.   And how does the nicotine � how does the

10   free form of nicotine relate to how quickly

11   nicotine gets to the brain?

12        A.   There have been different theories about

13   that.  In terms of how quickly nicotine gets to the

14   brain, my reading of the recent literature would

15   suggest that's not a particular factor.  There are

16   other factors that would relate to how quickly

17   nicotine may get to the brain.

22        A.   I've seen that some people have held that

23   view as a theory of one possibility, yes.

16        A.   I think generally, no.  I think the

17   concept is one that Reynolds' scientists are aware

18   of or were aware of, became aware of.  They were

19   aware of different things being put forward by

20   individuals in the government and so on in that

21   regard and by other scientists.  They've done

22   various kinds of analysis over time that may relate

23   to that concept.  But, no, I don't think they've

24   acted upon it from the standpoint of a product.

25        Q.   If free nicotine was -- strike that.

3    that.

4                Did R.J. Reynolds use its information

5    regarding how much free nicotine was available in d         xineir cigarette proQiicls m analyzing tne saies

7    performance of any of their cigarette brands?

8          A.   There have been individuals with theories

9    over time; and there was an individual, for

10    example, some years ago that looked retroactively

11    at a measurement called smoke pH versus market

12    share and the variability observed and lack of

13    concordance there.  So there have been some

14    evaluation of that based on theories that have been

15    forward.

16          Q.  Who's the individual you're referring to?

17          A.   I'm referring to an individual by the

18    name of Leslie Lewis.

2        Q.   So � and do you know when that was?

3        A.   I don't recall the exact date of the

4   document.  It would have been I believe in the

5   1980s.

6        Q.   Okay.  So R.J. Reynolds has never used

7   free nicotine in terms of analyzing how well their

8   product does?

9        A.   It will be a bit of a long answer,

10             But in terms of free nicotine, first of

11   all, it's been a theory that's been put forward, so

12   there's been some consideration of that that's

13   occurred by certain individuals.

14             But in terms of the concept of free

15   nicotine, it's also something that's required to be

16   reported by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for some

17   of its products.

3        A.  Again, there were views put forward that

4   somehow it may be related.  It was something that

5   had some interest, even some controversy around it.

7   science that's known today, is a very misguided

8   concept generally.  But it was part of that type of

9   an analysis to see looking backwards, was there

10   anything to what someone suggested was a

11   possibility.

12        Q.   But, I mean, when you're talking about

14   physiological effect of nicotine on the brain,

15   right?

16        A.   No.  I think you're talking about a

17   concept that's a solution chemistry concept.

18        Q.   Right.  The end result is how quickly

19   nicotine gets to the brain.

20        A.   Some suggested that that may be a

21   possibility.  Science today would not support that.

22        Q.   I'm not asking you whether you agree with

23   the science.  I'm asking you whether that's what

24   the concept is referring to.  Correct?

2   total, no.

3        Q.   I'm not saying in total.  I'm saying

4   that's at least part of the concept.

5        A.   Part of the concept is that may be one

6   factor that could be related to how quickly

7   nicotine would get to the brain, yes.

8        Q.   Right.  So if R.J. Reynolds were looking

9   at free nicotine and its relationship to sales

10   performance, they would be looking at an aspect of

11   their cigarette that has an effect on the brain and

12   its connection to sales, if they looked at it?

13        A.   You're asking if that was their intent.

14   It was not, in my understanding.  Their intent was

15   to understand the science as it was being put

15        A.   The first paragraph says, "Free nicotine

18   all of the difference.

	Mr. Blevins is concluding that pH

11
	correlates, but not as closely, as free nicotine

12
	with sales performance, correct?                     \

13
	A.   I don't take that from what's written

14
	here.  He says it "suggests."                       j

15
	Q.   Okay.

16
	A.   He hasn't concluded it,                   1

17
	Q.   "Our emphasis should be directed toward

18
	free nicotine while pH would provide us with a        ;

19
	measure of or tool to affect free nicotine."

20
	That's what he states, correct?

1   performance and pH if you desire."  That's what he

2   says, right?

3        A.   That's what it says, yes.

4        Q.   You're not aware of anybody being fired

5   at R.J. Reynolds for analyzing how free nicotine in

6   their cigarette products affected sales

7   performance, are you?

8        A.   No.

9        Q.   You're not aware of anybody being

10   punished, suspended, or sanctioned in any way for

11   analyzing how free nicotine affected sales

12   performance of R.J. Reynolds1 cigarette brands, are

13   you?

14        A.   No.  I think the concepts were well

15   investigated.

16        Q.   And when you say "well investigated," do

17   you mean that it was appropriate for R.J, Reynolds

18   to be analyzing how their -- the sales of their

19   cigarette products were affected by how quickly

20   nicotine gets to the brain?

21        A.   That's not what I said, no.  The concepts

22   were around products in general.  There were calls

23   put forward even by the Surgeon General and by

24   others that this may be something that should be

25   done.  I think it was investigated in a number of

	challenges that the company was facing were a good    j

25  complex mixtures; and since tobacco and cigarette    [

1   smoke are complex mixtures, it seemed like a good

2   fit.  It also, from what I'd looked at, looked like

3   a good company.  So I thought it was a good place

4   to start my career.

5             After I was there for a period of time

6   and learned about the company, I became very much

7   involved with the efforts to reduce the risks

8   associated with smoking through the development and

9   evaluation of new products.  It's kept me there

10   throughout the years.

11        Q.   Did you earn your Ph.D. in chemistry in

	It's something when someone pursues a degree, they    f

2
	can seek reimbursement for tuition.  And as long as   f

3
	they have a good grade in the course, that's

4
	reimbursed.  So I chose to be part of that and

5
	completed my Ph.D. after I joined the company.

6
	Q.   What was your first job as a chemist in

7
	the R&D department?                               |

8
	A.   My title when I was hired was junior

9
	research chemist, and I was responsible for           [

10
	applying chromatographic separation techniques to
 >

11
	evaluate tobacco and tobacco smoke.

12
	Q.   How does that relate to the concept         1

13
	you've talked about during the deposition called      j

14
	harm reduction?                                      j

15
	A.   In many ways.  Those techniques have been   I

16
	fundamental tools in trying to both identify the      1

17
	composition of tobacco in cigarette smoke and in      f

18
	terms of being able to quantify the concentrations    f

19
	of particular toxicants that are present in tobacco

20
	or tobacco smoke.                                  \

21
	So, for example, to be able to compare      I

22
	one product to another and determine if one has the

	Q.   Have you received a number of promotions

2
	during your 30-plus career at R.J. Reynolds?

3
	A.   I have, yes.

7
	Q.  What does it mean to be a principal

	scientist within Reynolds?

9
	A.   Within Reynolds there historically has

10
	been both a scientific and managerial ladder,

11
	different types of responsibilities.  So I was        j

12
	promoted through the scientific ranks.  The highest

13
	levels on the scientific ladder were master

14
	scientist, principal scientist, senior principal      |

15
	scientist.  These would have been levels that         j

16
	required, for example, a nomination and review

17
	process with contributions from those outside the     \

18
	company evaluating your work and your

19
	contributions.  So I worked my way through all of

20
	those different levels.                               \

	A.   Yes.  There have been a wide range of

20
	scientists; scientists that have had undergraduate    \

3        Q.   Can you explain what the significance is?

4        A.   It would be the first step in the

5   process.  If someone has an idea, they consider

6   that idea and so on; and they would then create a

7   document such as this, called a disclosure of

8   invention, where others would also sign and witness

9   the document.  That may or may not go further and

10   become a patent application.  It may or may not go

11   further than that if it were a patent application

12   and approved as a patent.

13        Q.   Do you know whether this disclosure of

14   invention was ever implemented in any commercial

15   cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds?

16        A.   To my knowledge this has never been part

17   of any products.

18        Q.   Have you written peer-reviewed

19   publications and made scientific presentations

20   during your career at Reynolds?

21        A.   Yes, I have.

22        Q.   Approximately how many publications have

23   you written that have appeared in the peer-reviewed

8
	carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

9
	MR. McPHARLIN:  Object to the form.

10
	A.   The reason that Reynolds would be

11
	publishing there is, first of all, to summarize       j

12
	what's known in the literature and to also c]_arj_fy    \

13
	which compounds are the ones to focus upon when       j

14
	developing and designing new cigarette designs or     i

15
	new tobacco product designs with the potential to     i

16
	reduce exposure to such compounds.                  \

17
	MR. LATHAM:  Do you have Composite 1?

18
	I'm looking for his reliance list.

19
	MR. McPHARLIN:  I think Exhibit 1 was the   (

20
	notice.

21
	MR. LATHAM:  You did a Composite 1 which

22
	had a whole bunch of documents.

1        A.   In the mid 1990s the Federal Trade

2   Commission was considering changing the FTC method,

3   the standard test method that was required for

4   determining tar and nicotine values that were put

5   on -- in cigarette advertising, for example.  They

6   were considering something called a 2-tier system.

7   So rather than a single machine testing condition,

8   they were considering two different testing

9   conditions to look at a range of yields.

10             So I met with representatives from the

11   FTC, and with their consultants, for example, and

12   talked through the objectives; designed an ij       experiment, along witin otiner scientistis at

14   different major tobacco companies that we shared

15   with the FTC; and then we conducted that experiment

16   and compiled the data and provided that to the

17   Federal Trade Commission.

18        Q.   Have you done work with any state Public

19   Health agencies?

20        A.   Yes, I have.

21        Q.   Can you give the jury a couple examples?

22        A.  Yes.  I've interacted with the Tobacco

23   Control Department for the Commonwealth of

24   Massachusetts in a couple different ways.  The

25   first was that in 1997 they were focused on

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221

Page 503

1   implementing a new test method that would look at

2   nicotine yields representative of what an average

3   smoker might experience when they smoke a

4   cigarette.  And so I met with them and, again,

5   devised an approach to that.  Ultimately, that was

6   implemented and continues today as far as testing

8             Additionally, there was a study that we

9   conducted called the Massachusetts Benchmark Study.

10   This was one that looked at mainstream smoke and

11   sidestream smoke of emissions of compounds reported

12   to be associated with the risks of smoking.  So we

13   developed an approach to be able to do that in a

14   practical and achievable manner and conducted a

15   very extensive study, summarized all of those

16   results in a multi-volume report, and provided

17   those to the Commonwealth about the year 2000.

18        Q.   Did you complete the work that you just

19   described with interacting with the FTC,

20   interacting with the Massachusetts Department of

21   Health while you were an employee of Reynolds

22   Tobacco?

24        Q.   Did your management support your work in

25   those efforts?

3   called Working Group 9?

4        A.   Yes, I was.

5        Q.   What was Working Group 9?

6        A.   Working Group 9 was part of ISO, which is   |

7   the International Organization for standardization.   j

8   It works to have common testing standards around      j

9   the world.

10             So the purpose of Working Group 9 was to

13   represent the many ways in which people may smoke

14   cigarettes.  So there were two experts identified     )

15   in each country or each member body.  There were

16   regulatory scientists, there were WHO-related        |

17   individuals; a wide range of individuals that met

18   as part of Working Group 9.                                                             j

19              In that, we evaluated the existing                        |

21   achieve the stated goal.

12   a company that sells nicotine-replacement therapy

13   products, products that are intended to help

1   rather than considering nicotine-replacement

2   therapy products for only a limited period of time,

3   they're indicating that some individuals may use

4   nicotine for a long period of time as part of

5   quitting smoking.  So they're changing what in

6   essence was a prohibition on use beyond a 12-week

7   period to one that would go on for a longer period

8   of time.

9        Q.   Is Reynolds' sister company, Niconovum,

10   part of Reynolds' efforts at what you've referred

11   to as harm reduction?

12             MR. McPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

13        A.   Yes.

14   BY MR. LATHAM:

15        Q.   You talked earlier in the deposition

16   about a continuum of risk.  How does Niconovum fit

17   into what you talked about earlier, about continuum

18   of risk?

19        A.   The way that Niconovum fits into the

20   continuum of risk is that for individuals that are

21   concerned about the risks of smoking and want to

22   quit, Reynolds wants those individuals to quit,

23             For some individuals, they may want to

24   continue using tobacco; and there are types of

25   tobacco that are not combusted that are associated

	Q.   Turn to the third page of the exhibit.      \

11
	It's Page � in the Federal Register � 19720.  Go

14
	A.   I do, yes.

15
	Q.   I'm going to read it.  The FDA writes,       |

16
	"We also note that although any nicotine-containing

17
	product has the potential to be addicting, based on   j

18

	As an expert in tobacco science, what

22
	does that mean to you?

23
	MR. j^cPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

1   addicting.  They're saying that it may be possible

2   that for some individuals they may be addicting,

3   but for others not.  The current state of the

4   science suggests that there's limited evidence for

5   them to have significant potential for abuse or

6   dependence.

3        A.   It says, "Significant reductions in the

4   harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be

5   achieved by providing accurate information

6   regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products

7   to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging

10        A.   It is, yes,

11        Q.   Under the subheading "Harm Reduction,"

12   will you read what your website says about harm

13   reduction.

14        A.   It says, "Reducing the diseases and

15   deaths associated with the use of cigarettes serves

16   public health goals and is in the best interest of

17   consumers, manufacturers, and society.  Harm

	nicotine
	is part of the tobacco plant, and

1
	A.   Yes.  The growing conditions in a given     |

2
	year can have a tremendous effect on the nicotine

3
	and sugars and the general composition of the

4
	tobacco.

5
	Q.   How do those variations and compositions

6
	of the tobacco affect Reynolds in the design and     j

7
	manufacture of their cigarettes?

8
	A.   They provide a significant challenge.       \

y
	Smokers expect their product to taste the same from

10
	one cigarette to the next, from one day to the

11
	next, much like most consumer products.  So the

12
	challenge is in blending and producing a uniform

13
	product over time when the tobacco coming in is

14
	quite variable.                                      \

15
	Q.   Why is a consistent product important for

16
	your business?                                      \

17
	A.   Again, because smokers expect their

18
	cigarettes to taste the same one cigarette to the     [

19
	next in the pack, from one pack to the next, and

20
	one year to the next.

3        Q.   Can you give the jury some examples of

4   some you're familiar with?

5        A.   Yes,  There have been a number of

6   different kinds of cigarettes.  One, for example,

7   would be Benson & Hedges DeNic, another one would

8   be King Santo, another one would be a cigarette

15   Hedges and Next cigarettes, who were those

16   manufactured by?

19   measurable amount of nicotine?

20        A.   They did, yes.

	A.   Smokers did not prefer those cigarettes.

2
	They didn't prefer the way they tasted compared to

3
	other cigarettes, so they were not popular.

4
	Q.   How do you know that?

5
	A.   I know that because they were not

6
	commercially successful.  There were not many

7
	people that purchased and adopted those products.

8
	And their feedback, to my understanding, is they

5
	I believe earlier in the deposition I

11        Q.   What is the ongoing research?

12        A.   Well, the ongoing research -- first of

13   all, the FDA Center for Tobacco Products has a

15   different areas.  One would be in this general

16   area; that is, to try and determine, is there such

17   a thing as an addictive level or nonaddictive level

18   and to try and look at ways that that might be

19   evaluated.

20             Additionally, there are scientists

21   publishing, even recently -~ and their science is

22   very clear -- the scientists would believe that

1
	A.   It was part of something that was being     i

2
	considered around trying to find cigarettes that

3
	had less risk associated with them, a so-called

4
	safer cigarette.  And it was one that suggested in

5
	reducing the potential risks associated with

6
	smoking that it may be one way to provide nicotine

7
	but reduce exposure to toxicants.                   |

8
	Q.   Did the Surgeon General actually           \

9
	recommend that this issue of free nicotine be

10
	researched as a way to make a less risky cigarette?   1

11
	A.   I believe so, yes.

Industry Response to Cigarette/Health Controversy

The tobacco industry has reacted to the challenge of the smoking_juid health controversy in the following ways:

(1)  Produce more filter brands and brands with lower tar delivery.

(2)  Support scientific research to refute unfavorable findings or at a minimum to keep the scientific question open.

(3)  Conduct information campaigns against claims by the, antlsmoklng lobby.

*

(4)  Voluntarily meet some of the demands of the antismoking lobby, such as agreeing to publish the FTC ratings on tar and nicotine in cigarette advertising,

(5)  -Corporate diversification to minimize the potential adverse

financial consequences of the controversy on cigarette sales.

The purpose of this note is to exaiaino the history of the interaction between the tobacco companies on one hand and the antlsmoking groups on the other hand, including particularly government agencies, with regard to the cigarette/health controversy.  Corporate diversification into other product lines and industries is not appropriate f*^        for discussion here,  It is of some interest, however, to consider briefly the informational and research response of industry before getting into the story of the direct confrontation between the contending forces.

The Tobacco Institute, founded in 1958, has been thetfocal point for criticism of research that indicates a connection between smoking' and health.  The Institute has attempted to keep the opposition honest.  It has carefully scrutinized the sampling difficulties and statistical deficiencies in the studies which allegedly indicate correlations between smoking and disease. The Institute also has vigorously opposed governmental control of the marketing of cigarettes. This rearguard action has bought time in which the companies could adapt to the-challenge, i.e. change themselves (through diversification) and change their products.

The Council for Tobacco Research (CT&) has dispersed over $2G million through 1973.  During the past 20 years the industry has committed more than $50 million to scientific research related to tobacco and health.  In December 1972, five cigarette companies including Brown & Williamson gave a $2,8 million grant to the Harvard Medical School for a 5�year investigation of any specific effects cigarette smoke may have in the development of lung and heart diseases.  In 1967, over $12 million was spent in the United States on smoking and health      ^ research.  In 1968,the figure increased to over $15 million.                           w

have allowed the industry to take a respectable stand along the following lines -

"After millions of dollars and over twenty years of research, the question about smoking and health is still open."

The tobacco companies have also beefed-up their Proprietary research expenditures. The initial wave of negative scientific rind�ngs ouued substantial increases in R&D budgets  Also ^^"^J of new brands demanded considerable attention to the need for greater

expenditures. The initial wave oi n*g*�ve BC;�""�J; "^JEeratioii caused substantial increases in R&D budgets. Also, the proliferation of new brands demanded considerable attention to the neec and faster technical responses in product development. -

The industry has moved strongly toward filter cigarettes, which havey increased from .6% in 1950 to 87% in 1975. KENT cigaret,  ^fe introduced in 1952 with an unusually heavy promotion campaign discussing the micronite filter. Other companies moved strongly into the rVpidly growing filter market.  In 1951, nine out of twenty brands on the market accounted for as much as 1% of market snare. By 1964 17 of 41 brands had more than 1% share of market.

This became known as the "tar derby" of the late 1*50 �*;.  It was characterized by sharply intensified advertising <^P^tion. By 1963 well over half of the total unit output was composed of brands which were unknown before 1950,

The new filter brands vying for a piece of the growing filter market ^"^   �,*/*�* pvtraordinarv claims. There was an urgent effort to highlight f     ana difJerentia?eyone brand from the others already on the market. It was important to have the most filter traps. Some claimed to oossess the least tars.  In most cases, however, the smoker of a **\+�** *i<Tari>tti>  wi<* cettine as much or more nicotine and tar as he filter Cigarette was getxinLa& ciearette.

had occupied since the health disclosures of the early 1950's � that of constantly reminding Its consumers through its own advertising that cigarettes carried a real threat to their health. The Reader's Digest, a severe critic of the industry, also blamed the FTC for "discouraging the manufacture of high filtration cigarettes and for rescuing the smoker from chaos only to leave him in ignorance." Later the FTC reversed itself and began testing and publishing the results respecting tar and nicotine content�

1964 Surgeon General's Report

The FTC had requested technical assistance and aid from the Public Health Service regarding labeling and advertising of-tobacco products* Flowing from this request was an announcement by the Surgeon General on June 7, 1962 that he was establishing an expert advisory committee to review all available data on smoking and health. A medical doctor from the FTC was an observer who participated in the first discussions of the advisory committee.  The result was the 1964 Surgeon General's Report.  On the same day that the advisory committee report was released by the surgeon General, the FTC announced its intention to move promptly to determine what remedial action the FTC should take in the public interest. A week later the FTC notified interested parties of its proposed rulemaking "for the prevention of unfair or deceptive advertising and labeling of cigarettes in relation to the health hazards of smoking,"

The FTC stated that it had "reason to believe that many current advertisements falsely state, or give the false impression, that cigarette smoking promotes health or physical well-being or is not a health hazard, or that smoking the advertised brand is less of a health hazard than smoking other brands of cigarettes." The FTC thought then that such advertising should be stoppedLand It continues to think it should be stopped.                                                    �

The Commission also said, more than a decade ago, that "Much current advertising suggests or portrays cigarette smoking as being pleasurable or desirable, compatible with physical health, fitness or well-being, or indispensable to full personal development and social success, without at the same time reminding the consumer of the serious health hazard of cigarette smoking.  Such advertising may create a psychological and social barrier to the consuming public's understanding and appreciation of the gravity of the risks to life and health involved in cigarette smoking." The FTC continues to advocate strict repressive controls on cigarette advertising notwithstanding the advent of a warning both on packages and in advertising.

In its 1964 trade rule request, the FTC asked for a health warning in , cigarette advertisements and on packages.  It further sought to forbid advertising that stated or implied that cigarettes (1) promote good health or physical well-being, (2) is not a hazard to health or

(3) is less a hazard to health than smoking other brands.

Counsel for the companies specifically contested the jurisdiction and authority of the Commission to promulgate the proposed trade regulation rules.  Court action was threatened which would certainly delay and would possibly overturn the FTC action.

Also support was mobilized in other industries. The Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. stated that the proposed rules were an undesirable extension of power which was better left to Congressional legislation.  The Advertising Federation of America and the Television Bureau of Advertising, Inc. claimed that it might establish a dangerous precedent for rulemaking against other industries.  The American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA) and the Radio Advertising Bureau, Inc. followed the tobacco industry's pattern in denying that the Commission had the authority to act,      *

Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965

The proposed 1964 FTC Trade Regulation was preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 which froze the FTCfs ability to move in the area until June 1969.  In May 1969 the FTC renewed its pressure for increased government regulation of cigarette advertising.  It announced that it would consider a proposed rule requiring that all cigarette advertising disclose the following warning:

Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous To Health And May Cause Death From Cancer, Coronary Heart Disease, Chronic Bronchitis, Pulmonary Emphysema, And Other Diseases.

In the 1969 Report to Congress, the FTC pointed to a Harris Poll indicating that over 50% of the public favored banning all cigarette advertising from television and radio.  In addition to  asking Congress to require the foregoing warning on packages and in advertising, the � FTC asked that tar and nicotine content of each cigarette be printed on the package and in all advertising.

The companies sought to defuse the attack by voluntarily agreeing in

September 1970 to disclose tar and nicotine content in advertising

and in 1972 by entering into a Consent Order under which the Surgeon

General's warning would be printed in all cigarette advertising.

These agreements were made with the express understanding that the

industry maintained its denial that the warning was necessary in

order to avoid deceptiveness in it's advertising or that the warning

was an accurate statement of fact.  When the first TStN figures

were released by the FTC in November 1967, The Tobacco Institute

released a statement saying that there was no scientifically

established relationship between tar and nicotine levels and human

health.  Also, the companies maintained the position that the

voluntary agreements did not constitute"an admission by the industry

that the FTC has authority to promulgate trade regulation rules.

Recently Congress has granted trade regulation rule power to the FTC*

Other Agency Actions

In June 1967 the Federal Communications Commission surprised the industry by announcing that the Fairness Doctrine required broadcasters to publish antismoking comment.  Roughly one antismoking  *~ commercial for three cigarette commercials was used as the measure of balance in presenting both sides of the issue.  This amounted to approximately $75 million worth of free promotion each year. The courts Upheld the FCC's Fairness Doctrine ruling in November 1968. In February 1969 the FCC released a second proposed rule and announced that it would ban the broadcast of cigarette commercials by radio and television stations.  In the 1969 notice of proposed rulemaking, the FCC stated that presentation of cigarette commercials id inconsistent with the obligation imposed on broadcasters to operate in the public  v interest.  It said that cigarettes posed a "unique danger - a danger "* measured in terms of an epidemic of deaths and disabilities." The tobacco industry reacted by proposing in July 1969 to voluntarily remove its commercial advertising from the broadcast media by September 1970.  Shortly thereafter the Congress enacted a ban on cigarette advertising in broadcast media and in this way vacated the FCC proposed regulation.

The threat and reality of court tests have challenged and contained the FCC and FTC. Those agencies consequently asked Congress to take action In order to avoid the lengthy court tests which would inevitably result from an attempt to carry out their rulemaking approaches.  The tobacco industry has used the threat of prolonged court tests as a means of successfully delaying and preventing the proposed regulations.

In volunteering to remove its advertising from broadcast media, the industry cited .two premises: Truthful advertising is a basic commercial right, and smoking is an adult custom* While the industry denies,the right of government to eliminate advertising, it consented to a broadcast blackout on the ground that it did not intend to appeal to a young audience.

Federal agencies with jurisdiction over interstate air and land travel have imposed segregation requirements pursuant to their rulemaking powers.  The Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (FCPSC) has* flirted with the idea of regulating cigarettes as a claimed fire or health hazard.

All of these federal agencies were able to act as boldly as they have because their relative independence has protected them from economic and political pressures. For example, by striking out at broad categories of action in trade regulation rule proposals instead of attacking specific ads which would be tied up in court tests, the FTC brought enormous publicity and public attention to the question of cigarette smoking and health.  The statutory independence of the federal agencies has permitted them to strike out repeatedly at the tobacco industry and create a generally threatening and uncertain future for it.

The Congress

Congress, on the other hand, has attempted to balance the economic concerns with the health concern in the cigarette smoking controversy. In passing the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 196 5 which required thB statement of the Surgeon General's warning on packaging, the Congress specifically stated that it was preempting state regula- . tion in order to avoid "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations. . .".

In other words, the Surgeon General's warning would be printed on packaging but for a period of time neither the federal agencies nor the states could enter the field.

The anti-cigarette lobby has called the cigarette labeling act a victory for the tobacco industry. One critic entitled her article "The Quiet Victory of The Cigarette Lobby - How It Found The Best Filter Yet - Congress", Luther Terry, former U.S. Surgeon General, said "I would never infer that Congress intentionally perpetrated a hoax, but to my interpretation it turned out to be that, despite the good intentions of the Congress." The bill prohibited for three years any requirements by any federal, state or local authorities that cigarette advertisements include the statement related to smoking and health.  Until the act expired in 1969, the FTC and the FCC were prohibited from requiring health warnings in advertising.

The tobacco industry wanted to prevent the chaos of nonuniform state and local regulation such as affects the alcohol industry.  To gain one crucial cost-saving objective, uniform regulation, the industry compromised by adding a health warning to the cigarette package. Another critic noted that "the label might even be a boon of sorts, providing a new defense for the industry" when new health suits were brought by persons claiming to have been injured by cigarette smoking.

The broadcast ban which was enacted by Congress in 1969 called for the elimination of all TV and radio cigarette advertising after January 1, 1971 as well as strengthening the cautionary statement.  The bill extended the preemption of state and/or local health regulation until June 1971.  The tobacco industry did not oppose the 1969   ^ or the 1965 enactments which were in some ways victories.        92

Some Conclusions and Observations                                                                       g*

The foregoing discussion illustrates that the federated nature of C0 the U.S. political system and the fragmentation of governmental J* authority and administrative responsibility are important in rf* determining the type of governmental response.                                           r*

So far government efforts to regulate cigarette advertising have constituted the main thrust of government concern and the a&pessive ^    antismoking lobby is highly dissatisfied with the impact such efforts O   have had on total consumption.  (The following page shows in chart-form the general upward trend in cigarette sales but suggests a .':' ' significant loss of volume due to political factors.) The reduction in cigarette advertising seems to have made the industry stronger economically* Profits have increased. The ban on television and other broadcast advertising does not seem to have reduced consumption. The concomitant reduction in the number of anti-cigarette commercials is considered to be a severe loss in the effort to keep public concern and awareness of the controversy at a fever pitch.

Like the meat industry and recently the automobile industry, tobacco^ products are now coming under close scrutiny and governments are attempting to establish control over the products, as opposed to merely the advertising, to protect the public.

The warnings, the tar and nicotine ratings and the anti-cigarette commercials were all part of the effort to educate children and ciearette consumers not to smoke.  Implicit in the policy of education is the idea that the consumers should make the basic decision and will make the "right" decision, provided they are given more knowledge."  In short, inform the public, and �f ^^l^nt has not public to change the pattern of consumption  The government has no vet intervened directly to change the content of the product or limit its use. The protection of nonsmokers also has become an important and growing focus of the antismoking lobby with the announced purpose O   of making cigarette smoking an unacceptable social custom which they compare to siting.  At least 26  bills have been added to some 70 antlsmoking proposals in state legislatures for action in 1976, involving 26 states,  characteristically these measures would restrict the places where smoking may lawfully occur.      ^

It is clear, however, that many anti-cigarette zealots and some nubile officials believe that the responsibility of the government does not end with merely warning the public of the hazards.  They advocate direct intervention. Senators Kennedy and Hart recently SrODOSed a health research bill to be financed by a tax related to ?he tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. At about the same time, + h.� RTH+iQh Minister of Health announced on national television tnai I       he tended to lay an order before Parliament bringing additives and substitutes under the Medicines Act, which order must be approved by resolution of each House. The tobacco industry, of course, �ould prefer no regulation at al1

_The manufacturers * marketing strategy has been to overcome and even "to make marketing use of the smoktng/health connection,  Individual tobacco companies have benefited from government actions.  Thus the '�tar derby,r in the United States resulted from industry efforts to cater to the public's concern and to attract consumers to the new,.;, filtered brands.  The heavy use of television in the introduction~of WINCHESTER represented a bald exploitation of the little cigar loophole in the broadcast ban law. The current duel between TRUE and VANTAGE and between CARLTOK and NOW are other examples of competitive efforts to capitalize on ftte smoking/health controversy.

Market conditions are important in determining company response.  In a rapidly changing cigarette market, it is difficult to obtain industry cooperation because cooperation tends to affect individual firms unevenly'.                                                                                   -�

Historically, member companies have assignud The Tobacco Institute the task of official positioning and response to controversial questions surrounding the smoking and health issue*   During the past year, however* we have noticed two new developments which may eventually affect this consortium strategy:

(1)   Increased competition among manufacturers in the low-tar segment, including both new product introductions as well as accelerated advertising for existing brands.   Such activity should add to the already high level of awareness of the smoking and health issue, especially as manufacturers continue to address the health question directly in their advertising messages. Continued heavy pressure in this area can be anticipated.

(2)   One company, at least�Philip Morris--has developed an individualized approach, and established mi internal staff with the specific assignment of determining company strategy and response to health issues that previously were handled by The Tobacco Institute alone,   This is n radical departure from the former commitment of member manufacturers to combined positioning, and, no doubt, indicates a trend that could lead to stronger and rrtarc Individualized public relations programs directed at

LP 2873.0002

00 CO

legislative and political activity as welt as general public and consumer affairs�

Still, with rare exception, the bulk of public relations activity concerning industry response to the smoking and health controversy emanates from The Tobacco Institute,   As a representative of member manufacturers, the Institute acta as official spokesman for the industry, always reflecting official strategy positions agreed upon by all members.

Essentially, the official position still recognizes that the evidence against cigarettes is inadequate to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and health.   On the other hand, the industry does not claim that the flaws in the evidence constitute proof that there is no such relationship. In other words, very serious questions have arisen which deserve scientific answers.   Consequently, the question about tobacco and health is still a question�and until Buitable answers are found, the industry's position will reflect a low profile public relations strategy.

The Institute, contrary to the mission of other trade associations, does not represent the commercial interests of the manufacturers.  There is no attempt to enter the competitive squabbles between member companies, or to promote the sale of any cigarette products.          ^

Furthermone, the Institute does not try to take on issues in which it Is not a logical participant.   An example is the question of whether schools should

�^

have smoking areaa or not.  It would be illogical for a manufacturer'a group to enter that debate.

And the Institute doea not entertain conflict with anti-smoking agencies, quit smoking clinics, or the like.   Member manufacturers agree that it is not the Instituted job to Influence an individual's decision about whether or not to smoke.

The Institute never suggests that the economic contribution of the tobacco industry should outweigh resolving the health controversy.   The furthest it goes is to tell the public what the impact of tobacco is upon the economy.

The Institute's role, then, is primarily reactionary and its communications programs arc designed, for the most part, to counteract, or dispute, misunderstandings that are commonly held by the general public Or inaccuracies published in the consumer press.  The tools used to accomplish this run the complete gamut of public relations techniques! lettcrn-to-the-editor, a bimonthly newsletterj feature article placements, pamphlets and brochures, films, direct mail and one-on-one communication with government officials.

During the past year, the Institute's four new media communicators have made more than TOO public appearances, including radio-TV and newspaper interviews and speeches before clubs in 42 states and the District Of Columbia.

t

In addition. Tl field representatives have continued to conduct area meetings

involving all members of the tobacco industry in their respective areas.

690020B08

LP 2873.0004

W CO
pgNbr=248
4 -

The purpose of the meetings has been to alert individuals in the industry to political and public relations problems, particularly with respect to state and local legislation which would restrict smoking.

The Institute films, "Leaf," ''Smoking and Health: The Need To Know," and "The Answers VVe Seek, " have been seen fcy more than 1/2 million people during the past year.

Reactions to these communications programs by the press and consumer audiences have been primarily positive.  However, major circulation magazines such as Time, Newsweek, Esquire and leading newspapers such 813 ***e Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, have recently carried major editorial features that berate the industry and call for tighter government controls.   Consumer Reports hau recently warned that low-tar cigarettes may not reduce the health threat since moat consumers tend to increase their smoking after switching to theac brands.   In addition, the influential publication has called for a complete advertising ban on all cigarette products.

Also, popular female audience magazines seem to have launched a concerted effort lo educate their readership about the dangers of smoking.   Most use

among women are on the rise.

O

to women.

FOr the first time since the broadcast ban, We are beginning to see strong anti-smoking messages appear in popular prime-time television programs that appeal primarily to teenagers and young adults.  There also seems to be a growing trend on variety, sit-com and panel talk shows to treat the smoker as a second class citizen, emphasizing not only the health aspects but the anti-social nature of the habit as well.   In many instances, these somewhat veiled anti-smoking "commercials," which are transmitted within the context of a scripted "situation," are more effective than the earlier "pure" commercials we were forced to combat before the ban,

It seems clear that we are rapidly approaching a sociological phenomenon which creates a hostile battlefield between smoker and non-smoker*   There is a considerable amount of social pressure, at some levels of society in particular (young educated adults, middle class), to stop smoking and to encourage general social disapproval of the practice.

In summation, then, the basic public relations strategy of American manufacturers responding to the smoking and health controversy Is funnelled through The Tobacco Institute and concentrates on the following techniquea and practices;

(1)   Publicizing scientific research funded by the industry which produces counter evidence to unfavorable findings or, at least, helps to keep the question open,

(2)   Conducting public information campaigns against the claims of

anti-cigarette groups and individuals.   Much of this activity is directed at reducing the current flurry of anti-smoking legislation on the local and state government levels,

(3)   Monitoring sociological and psychological factors that condition consumer response to the smoking and health question and its advocates,

(4)   Encouraging industry-wide cooperation in voluntarily meeting some of the demands of the ijrtei.ea<t3 favoring regulation in order to reduce the pressure for governmental control,

Mr, K* S, Smith, Jr,

Free nicotine does help explain the differences in performance between Winston, Marlboro, Salem &nd Kool but not all of the difference- '     *        ^

We have reviewed free nicotine, advertising expenditures, and lOOnan spin-off data for Winston, Harlboro, Salem and Kool from 1963 through 1972 and found that the difference in share performance of the 85mm styles of each brand is affected by all of the above factors independently and collectively*

Together these three factors statistically explain 97% of the variability between share performance of Winston and Marlboro (King and Bort). They explain 95% of the variability between Salem and Kool.

The variability due to "free nicotine" was significant and its contribution was over and above that of advertising expenditures and 10Omni spin-off.

Other factors which we reviewed but which did not seeirt to corre* late favorably weret

combined nicotine, tar,

nitrogen, and sugar.

Ammonia and out-of-stock conditions looK promising, but we have only limited data on both.

Our analysis suggests that pH does not correlate as closely with share perfr nances as does free nicotine. Our emphasis should be directed toward free nicotine while pH would provide , us with a measure of or tool to effect free nicotine. We will V conduct correlations between performance and pH if you desire* /\

the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds* historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds* laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds* R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, IARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Eh-. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are           �J

consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a manufacturing standpoint. He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and mat the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce"tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective,           g
pgNbr=260
Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including: filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette papers); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that* at all times, Reynolds* cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated wtar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar"* products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar'* and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low * V brand style extensions to the parent brand.   Dr.

Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the

smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds* work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds* development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm Auction technique.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute�Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the tact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than' 10 mg "tar," 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds* product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by          �3

Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds* disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers, He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine,'' does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

Dr. Borgerding will testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds'

Our Vision and Mission

Transforming Tobacco

Our Vision: We will achieve market leadership by transforming the tobacco industry.

We will lead change in our industry by:

�   Driving innovation throughout our businesses

�   Redefining enjoyment for adult tobacco consumers

�   Reducing the harm caused by smoking

�   Accelerating the decline in youth tobacco use

�   Resolving controversial issues related to the use of tobacco

Visit www.ReynoldsAmerican.com for more information on the transforming tobacco strategy of Reynolds American Inc. and its subsidiaries, including R J. Reynolds.

The tobacco Industry is shaped by innumerable laws and regulations reflecting society's policy choices. We believe that policies built around respect for the adult tobacco consumer's ability to make informed choices are the best way to reduce the harm caused by cigarettes. We support policies that ensure adult tobacco consumers have a range of tobacco- and nicotine- based products to choose among and accurate information about the risks presented by different tobacco products. The adult tobacco consumer's right to choose can be protected while we seek to ensure that youth make the right choice, and avoid tobacco entirely. We will continue to work with stakeholders to promote policies that transform tobacco.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

A.  Smoking am! Tolxivco Dependence; Tobacco use is the leading

preventable cause of death and disease in tho United States. According to an estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cigarette smoking causes 443.000 deaths each year in the United States, including nearly 50,000 deaths pev year from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke (Kef. I}. Smoking is known to cause multiple canters, heart disease, stroke, complications of pregnancy, chronic, obstructive pulmonary dhweurn, and many other diseases that, On average, shorten smokers' lifespan* by 14 years (Ref.2).

Surveys show that approximately 70 percent of Current smoker* want lo stop smoking, aud neatly half of all smokers make a quit attempt each year (Rett 3], Unfortunately, dependence on nicotine-the primary addictive substance in tobacco�- is a chronic disease that often retinues repeated intervention and multiple quit attempts lo overcome. As a result, only a small percentage of smokers successfully quit each year (Rcl 3).

B, 0wr-{fltt-�ou/�ter Nicotine tieplocenmnt Therapies

Nicotine replacement therapy {NKT} products are designed to help people stop smoking by supplying controlled amounts of nicotine to'oase ihe withdrawal symptoms associated with a quit attempt. NRT products do Jiot contain all of the carcinogens and other harmful constituents that are found in cigarCito smoke. There arc currently thrco types of NRT products approved by FDA for over-the-counter (OTC) us** as smuking utrosalidn aids; Nicotine gum, transdermal nicotino patch, and nicotine lozenge products.1 The nicotine gum and patch products were originally approved through the new drug application fNDA) process between 1984 and 1992. Bolh thsgum and the patch were initially available by prescription only; these products wars switched from prescription to OTC status between 1Q9Q and 2002. The nicotine loxenge imd mini-ltoenge werer approved directly for OTC use in 2002 and 2009. rcspoctivsly.

Currently, foe FDA-approved labeling �for OTC RRT products instructs consumers that they should stop smoking when they'begin using the product and that they should nut use

the product in combination wilh cigarettes or other nicoltne-containmg products (including olher NRT products). The labeling also recommends a specific duration of use of up lo 12 weeks, depending on the product, and instructs consumers lo slop using the NRT product at Ihe tmd of that period. Consumers are advised to consult a doctor if ihey feel ihey need to continue using the NRT product for longer than die recommended course of treatment.

In recent years, a number of stakeholders in the public health and health care provider communities have suggested that these labeling statements act as barriers to the effective use of OTC NRT products for smoking cessation. These stakeholders have argued lhal Hie statement advising against concomitant use of the NRT products with cigarettes may cause some smokers to abandon quit attempts if they experience) a lapse (e.g., if they havo a cigarette while using an NRT product). Stakeholders have also argued that use of more than one NRT product (e.g., patch phis gum) is more effective for some smokers than use of a single NRT product in achieving cessation, and that current labeling discourages such use, Willi regard to duration of use, stakeholders have argued lhal Ihe use of OTC NRT products beyond the labeled treatment period may increase the chances of quilling forcerlain smokers.2 These stakeholders have asserted lhal there are no safety concerns associated with concomitant use of OTC NRT products wilh other nicotine-conlaining products, or with the use of OTC NRT products for longer than the labeled duration of use.

Over tho nearly 30 years since NRT products were first approved, evidence has accumulated to suggest that the current labeling provisions on concomitant use and duration of use may no longer bo necessary to ensuro tho safe use of OTC NRT prqducts for smoking cessation. Based on this evidence, FDA has concluded lhal Ihe current labeling statements for OTC NRT products concerning concomitant use and duration of use can be modified as described in this document. We invite the products' sponsors lo submit supplemental NDAs (labeling supplements) tu modify iheso statements in the labeling of their drug products. To facilitate tho process, the Agency has identified revisions lo the labeling of OTC NRT products that can

* In I his rtuliiw, llut Agrniuy Ukts no p ok i I inn mi the afftctiviuHa of NRT product* wlitsa used concomitantly with iillntr iitcuttne-ctmtatalng pruducta, or whtn used far longw lh*u lh*� labeled durnUon ?( ww.

be included in these labeling supplements, Those revisions arc set forth in section II,

II. Proposed Revisions to the Labeling of OTC NRT Product*

A. Concomitant Use of OTC NRT Products With Cigarettes or Other Nicotine-Containing Products, Including Other NET

The "Drug Fads" section of ihe label for OTC NRT products currently contains two statements relating to ihe use of these products wilh olher nicotine-containing products. The first statement is found under tho "Do not uso" subheading of the "Warnings" section. II inslrucls consumers not to uso the OTC NRT product if they "continue lo smoke, chew tobacco, use snuff, or use [a different NRT producl! or other nicoline containing- products." This statement was included in the labeling because al the lime during which those products were switched to OTC use, there was little reliable data on the safety of ihe higher levels of nicotine that would resull from using NRT products in combination with other nicotine-containing products. Tho second statement appears under the "Directions" section, and tells consumers to "stop smoking completely when you begin using the |NRT product|." This statement was Included in the label because in Hie clinical trials lhal were conducted for Ihe original NRT product approvals, individuals who stopped smoking completely when they began using NRT were more likely to quit.

Since we first approved NRT products for OTC use, a number of studies have been conducted that provide information on the safely of usuig NRT products in combination wilh other nicotine-containing products. Many of liiese studies focused on the effects of using NRT products while smoking. For example, there have been studies on lite use of NRT products by smokers who were not immediately interested in quilting (sec Hatsukami el al., 2007), on ihe use of NRT products as an aid to smoking reduction {��� Wennike et al., 2003; Datra ct al� 2005). and on the uso of NRT products before initiating a quit attempt (Lindsun and Aveyard, 2011). In addition, several studies have been conducted on the use of higher-than-standard-dose NRT products (T0nneson ct al., 1999) and on tho concomitant use of more lhau one typo of NRT producl (see Bohadana el al., 2000; Piper ct al., 2009),

Upon reviewing the published reports of ihese and othor studies, we have determined that the concomitant use of

OTC NRT products with cigarettes or with other nicotine-containing products dues not raise significant .safety concerns. The published literature contains few reports of adverse events arising from Lhe use of NRT products while smoking or using another NRT product, The Agency also notes that few adverse events have been reported in studios of concomitant use conducted under the investigational new drug (IND) process, which involves mandatory reporting of adverse events. Accordingly, we are announcing lhal lhe statements in the current labeling of OTC NRT products relating to concomitant use of those products with olher nicotine-containing products can he modified. Th� following specific changes lo the current approved "Drug Facts" labeling aro recommended:

�  Warnings. The "Do uol use" subheading and the statement underneath it instructing consumers not lo use the NRT producl if ihey "continue lo smoke, chew lobacco, use snulT, or use fa different NRT product) or other nicotine containing products" should be deleted.

�  Directions. The third bullet should be revisod from "slop smoking completely when you begin using the [NRT product]" to "begin using the [NRT product) on your quit day,"

B, Duration of Use ofOTCNHT Products

Currently, tho labeling of OTC NRT products recommends a specific duration of use of up to 12 weeks, depending on lhe producl. For example, lhe "Drug Fuels" section of die label for nicotine gum and lozenge products recommends that Ihose products be used for 12 weeks; die label for certaiu nicotine patch products recommends a duration of use of a weeks, others 10 weeks. These labeled durations of use reflect the treatment pttriods that were studied in the clinical trials that supported lhe switch of these products to OTC stalus. Because NKT products treat the acule withdrawal symptoms associated with a quit attempt, and Ihuse symptoms typically diminish over Lime, most of lhe clinical trials conducted Lo support approval were short�generally between 6 and 12 weeks in length.

In addition to recommending a specific duration of use, current OTC NRT product labels direct consumers lo stop usiug die product at die end of tho recommended treatment period and to talk lo a doctor if they fool they need to use Lhe producl longer. This statement was included in the labeling because at tho timo of tho first prcscription-to-OTC switch, thoro was insufficient data lo

address the Agency's concern that consumers could potentially become dependent on NRT products.

fo the years since NRT products became available lor OTC use, a number of studies have examined the use of NRT products over periods longer than 12 weeks. We have reviewed the published literature on this longer-term use of NRT products and have not idenLifitHl any safely risks associated with such uso. A well-known and highly regarded study on the effects of long-term uso of NRT producls is the Lung Health Study, hi which almost 6,000 smokers were given access to free nicotine gum for up to 5 years (see Murray el al., 1996). In this study, over 1,000 subjects were still using the gum after 1 year. The adverse effects of long-term nicotine gum use reported by these subjects were described as minor and transient, and there was no correlation Iwlween long-term gum use and cardiovascular events. A foUowup study found that long-term ad lib use of nicotine gum neither increased nor decreased the Lung Health Study subjects' likelihood of developing cancer (sec Murray et al� 2009). Other informative studios on the effects of long-term uso of NRT products include

We have determined that these labeling revisions may be addressed through a changes being effected [CBV.) supplement under 21 CFR 314.70(c)(6).

We are also recommending con Forming changes to other FDA-opproved labeling for OTC NRT producls, such as product user guides and leaflets. Copies of the recommended changes lo these other labeling items may be obtained from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's Division of Nonprescription Clinical Evaluation (sec ADDRESSES).

III. Conclusions

We have determined that the current OTC NRT producls can bo used safely and affectively for their approved intended use as aids to smoking

a 52-week study of NRT product use in which nearly half of the subjects used two or more OTC NRT products in combination (see Joseph et al., 2011), and a trial involving the use of nicotine patches for 6 lo 12 months by nonsmoken with mild cognitive impairment (sec Ncwhouse ct al., 2012). Both of these studies bad high rates of completion and reported few adverse events from long-term use of NRT products.

We also note thai although any nicotine-containing product has the potential to be addicting, based on the available evidence, currently marketed OTC NRT producls do not appear lo have significant potential forahuse or dopendence. A 2010 review of historical reports made lo ihe Agency's Adverse Event Reporting System and to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Drug Abuse Warning Network between iy�4 and 2009 suggested lhal NRT producls have a low potential lor abuse. Several published sludies have also found that the abuse liability and dependence potential of NRT products is low, especially compared to cigarettes (see West el al.. 2000; Houtsmnllor et al., 2002).

cessation with Ihe labeling modifications identified in section 11. We encourage the submission of labeling supplements for these drag products. These supplements should modify the labeling statements concerning concomitant use and duration of use as described in section II. The requirement for data to support these labeling changes may be met by citing the published literature we relied on in preparing this notice. A list of the published literature and reprints of the reports will be available for public inspection in tho Division of Dockets Management (see ADDRESSES). It is unnecessary to submit copies and reprints of the reports from the listed published literature, We invite applicants to submit any other pertinent

Accordingly, wo are announcing that the statement in the labeling of OTC NRT producls directing consumers tn stop using the NRT product at the end of the recommended treatment period can be modified. The following specific change to the current approved "Drug Facts" labeling is recommended:

� Directions. The last bullet should be revised from "it is important to complete tretitment. Stop using the [NRT product! al Lhe end of |x| weeks. If you still feel Lhe need to use [tho NRT product], talk to your doctor" to "it is important lo complete treatment. If you feel you need to use (the NRT product! for a longer period to keep from smoking, talk to your health aire provider."

C. Summary of Proposed Labeling Revisions

In light of currently available evidence on lhe concomitant use of OTC NRT products with cigarettes or oilier nicotine-containing producls, and on the use of OTC NRT producls beyond the labeled period of treatment, the following changes lo the "Drug Facts" labeling of OTC NRT products are recommended;

studies and literature of which they arc aware.

IV. Published Literature Supporting Proposed Labeling Revisions

Particulate Phase

Tar

In the experimental setting, a dose response has been established between tar application or smoke inhaled and tumor yield (2,8). These data support epidemiological findings relating the amount of cigarette smoke inhaled and the likelihood of cancer of the oral cavity, cancer of the long, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease in humans {U, if,46), Thus, as long as warnings of health hazards from smoking are disregarded and as long as cigarettes are consumed, efforts towards a reduction of tar and smoke components which may contribute to these health hazards should be continued.

Several approaches affect tar reduction in the smoke by modification of the cigarette filler {11, U), and many of these have, in fact, been applied to cigarettes manufactured in the United States and other countries (Figure 15). The most widely used techniques are summarized in Table 25. The application of a combination of these techniques has led to low tar cigarettes; air dilution of smoke is a prominent feature of many of the recently introduced low-tar brands (<10 mg). Homogenized leaf curing ($7) and reduction of tobacco proteins (�*) are currently being thoroughly investigated as additional methods for reduction of tar, nicotine, and other harmful smoke components.

Nicotine

Nicotine and the minor tobacco alkaloids are largely responsible for tobacco habituation, smoke flavor, and smoke toxicity and are the precursors for the tobacco specific N-nitrosamines. Since 1926, research programs have been directed toward the reduction of the tobacco alkaloids (t9); a combination of methods has, in fact, led to a drastic lowering of nicotine in the smoke of U.S. cigarettes (Figure 16). The methods summarized in Table 25 for the reduction of tar in cigarette smoke apply also to the reduction of nicotine in the smoke. Selective reduction of tobacco alkaloids has been achieved by breeding specific varieties and by close spacing of tobacco plants. After harvesting the tobacco, leaf nicotine can also be selectively reduced by oxidation with bacterial enzymes, special curing conditions, reaction with alkylating agents, extraction with water and ammonia, and by steam distillation. Since cigarettes in the United States and in most foreign countries are made of floe-cured tobacco, are blends with flue-cured tobacco as a major ingredient or, in a few cases, are blends with Turkish tobacco, the pH of the resulting mainstream smoke is below 6,5 and thus essentially contains only protonated nicotine. Nicotine salts, however, are a part of the particulate matter and are, therefore, not amenable to significant selective filtration.

Review of lnieraMJlenoils Regarding Cigarette Smoke pH and Safe* Trends OBJECTIVE:

To review internal R&D reports regarding cigarette smoke pH methodology and the relationship of smoke pH to cigarette safes trends.

SUMMARY; "

The history of smoke pH methodology is briefly summarized in this review, particularly regarding the many changes in methodology during the 1960'sand 1970's, The various approaches to smoke pH measurements make comparisons over long periods of time difficult to interpret. In addition, diffferent researchers appeared to have dirTtfent ideas of what was the most meaningful of the different smoke pH values that could be measured.

This chronology is important because of an RJR Research Department "finding" in the early !970*s that "high" smoke pH was a characteristic common to several competitive cigarette brands that were showing increasing sales trends. However, using a database that spans over a decade and is based on a consistent smoke pH test method, it appears that sales trends of the !970's were not determined by smoke pH, despite the correlations reported. From this review.the correlations of the early I970's appear to have been merely coincidental in nature, calculated at a time when certain cigarette brands were growing their market share and their smoke pH happened to be relatively high. There is no evidence from the historical data reviewed that the smoke pH of RJR brands was purposely increased to enhance sales,

Introduction

Over the years, a number of different analytical techniques have been employed at RJR to measure the pH of cigarette smoke (e.g., 1-7). The idea of measuring smoke pH i$ contrary to the classic chemical definition of pH, which is "[t]he acidity or basicity of solutions [is] frequently expressed in terms of a function of the H* ion concentration..." (8 at 439). Because smoke is an aerosol (solids and liquid droplets suspended in gas phase) and not a solution ("a homogeneous molecular dispersion of two or more substances," jg, at 388), and changes its composition and structure quickly as it cools and dissipates, measurement of smoke pH is a difficult task with results of questionable meaning. While extremes in smoke pH can render a product unsmokeable, some researchers in years past have regarded smoke pH as a possible factor in "smoke balance1' that influenced consumer acceptance.

History of "Smoke pH" Test Methods at am

During the period from the mid 1960's to the mid 1970's, it appears from the in-house literature that the method or technique for measuring smoke pH was continually revised for improved reproducibility and/or meaning. In 1971, Harrdl and Musselwhite described earlier smoke pH metltodotogy as follows (3):

In previous (prior to -1966] attempts to gain information about smoke pH, cigarette smoke was simply passed into distilled water which could then be subjected to the traditional pH measurements of solutions. However, the single puffin as little as 1 ml of water produced a rather weak mixture and it appeared that carbon dioxide was probably the only compound contributing substantially to changes in pH.

Some reports also refer to Mpad pH" or "Cambridge pad pHT\ In this method, 5 cigarettes were smoked and the particulate matter was collected on a Cambridge pad. The pad was then placed in a given vohune of water, and the pH of the solution was measured

(9).

Sometime during 1966 or 1967, the general procedure described by Sensabaugh and CundirT(2) was followed, where **{t]he smoke was not collected in water but was allowed to come in contact with a combination pH electrooe with a thin film of water on the surface" (3). Yet, within a few years, difficulties with that method were recognized:

As long as pH values have been evaluated seriously, there have been reservations about their use and uncertainties about the interpretations to be drawn from pH puff by puff profiles...The puff by puff measurement of cigarette smoke pH by the . procedure has been termed an 'art' by some workers because of the difficulty encountered by all but a few in reproducing results. In this study the following fectors were found to affect smok* PH values: (1) moisture and physical characteristics of the cigarette sample, (2) puff rate, duration and frequency, (3) concentration of the smoke around the measuring electrode; (4) any buffering of the electrode, (S) thickness of

6
pgNbr=337
moisture film on electrode, and (6) the pH reading at time cigarette is lighted1'

The puff-by-puff pH measurement provided a number of values for pH, including a minimum and maxiiwtm value for each puff An average dgarette minimum and maximum, and at times, an overall average pH value, were reported m various studies that used this method. This author has found inconsistencies in, or at times no description of, which of these values was used in some reports. It appears thai some show the average value, others use the maximum average by cigarette, whSo Sensabaugh and MusseHvmte (10) believed that

'ti]n evaluation of pH data taken from the RJR puff-by-puff tpparatus, the greatest emphasis should be placed on the mjn]mijm_values obtained, since these represent smoke in a more nearly equilibrium state.1' [Emphasis in original].

The &a that different researchers placed a different degree of emphasis on the various values obtained by the puff by-puff analysis makes interpretation of data from one time period to another, or from one report to another, very difficult. In addition, Harris and Hayes (7) also point out that

" ..since these pH measurements are usually made on a single dgarette per determination m& replicate determinations show a reproducibility of-f 0.3 pH unit*, accumulation of representative data lor a given brand is time consnmmg,** [Emphasis added, at 58].

In a comparison of two brands, particularly where the number of analyses or replications was small, the determination of whether the brands display different smoke pH values may be difficult. For example, a given cigarette style could show a smoke pH of 5.7,6.0, or 6,3 k different analytical runs. A second cigarette style might show smoke pH values of 5,6, 5.9, and 6.2. While me average smoke pH of each cigarette k sraaUr, specific values of the range to compute that average may appear to be quite different, for example 5.6 va 6.3. In limited tearing, differences or omikrities between two cigarette brands (^iiidrjeimsleadmg.

Sensabaugh and MusseKvrute (10) conducted a study in late 1969 and early 1970 "to determine routinely the pH of smoke from production WAOTCW cigarettes...". Ihcy conducted multiple tests from a variety of sann^ and meir data provide an mtereatkg look at the smoke pH variability possible within one carton (different packs) and across cartons manufactured it the same time. Figures 1 and 2 show examples. Figure 1 shows aa example of the jninimum and maximum smoke pH measured from 10 packs within one carton, (ft u assumed thjft tl� lu^ m^

correctly in Reference 10. Even if it is not, the range of maximum pH for the remaking packs is 0.33 pH units). Figure 2 allows the smoke pH variation over 14 different cartons produced over the same day. The range lor mkumum pH was 5,59 to 5.94, and the range for ttuxnmtm pH was 5.97 to 6.31. Whether these data are showing dgarette~tc~cigarette
pgNbr=338
or test-to-test variability, it is clear that single cigarette analyses, even run multiple times, may not provide meaningful information regarding smoke pH. Cutainly no "routine" analysis, such as competitive brand monitoring, involved the number of replications reported in (10).

In their 1971 report, Harreil and MussetwhJte offered some modifications to the pu&by-puff procedure to improve it They also suggested that a "technique involving continuous puffing would offer an alternative means of smoke pH measurement, if puff by puff values were not desired11 but reported that a great deal of study would be necessary before such an approach could be approved for use. m the following years, however, such a technique was developed and modified (4-7). The "multiport1' method produced a single pH value based on the smoking of 10 to 20 cigarettes staukaneousry, and according to one report, "...pH readings from the 20-port smoking machine agree more nearly with the maximum pH readmga than the average pH readings obtained with the single port smoking maohme." It appeari that the muMpoit pH method did not replace the puteby-puff method until the late 1970's, This approach to pH measurement has also been referred to as the "stirred trap" method.

It appears that no effort was made to reconcile the different values obtained by the different test methods, that is, no correction factors were generated to compare data from one method to another. Interpretation or comparison of smoke pH values is a difficult enough task when the method generates different types of vahws, such as with the puff-by-puff method of the lace 1960*b and early 1970*s. The reproducibility problems with that method further complicate such comparisons. The meaning, therefore, of comparisons across the various test methods overtime is questionable at best, md it is inappropriate to draw conclusions from such comparisons.  �

Hypotheses of Cigarette Smoke pH as a Quality Factor

A research project was initiated in 1971 to provide information pertmeM to studies of "smoke balance control" (11). Several research reports on this project compare RJR cigarette brands to those of competitors in terms of physical and chemical analyses of tobacco, smoke, fiken, and cigarette papers, Early in this investigation, smoke pH became a factor of primary interest (12-13). m some reports, sales trends of different cigarette bfinds were compared and often correlated to other cigarette characteristics. Some of these characteristics were measured, but others were theoretical in nature (14-16).

Woods reported in 1973 that smoke pH appeared to be an important factor to "smoke strength and taste** (14). To test this hypothesis, he analyzed smoke pH data and sales trends for popular filtered cigarettes, and calculated statistically significant positive correlation coefficients between these two variables for 1971 and 1972. Woods theorized thai the cigarettes with higher smoke pH were of higher strength," and therefore more likely to be chosen by smokers

WhSe a quick look at the graphs presented in the Woods report (Kef 14, Eg. 1-4) could indeed lead one to believe that a strong positive correlation existed between smoke uH and sales trends, a closer examination reveals that these graphs are misleading and the conchurions Woods drew from them are wrong.
pgNbr=339
First, the smoke pH values shown are the same for 1971 and 1972, and are based on averages calculated from data generated over the two years. The number of observations, the range of values in those observations, and the actual observations from which the averages were calculated are not reported It is also unclear what pH value (average, tnaximum, or some other value) was used.

Secondly, the sales trend data are shown as "% change in sales" based on sate* of the previous year (1971 relative to 1970,1972 relative to 1971). Use of the % change in sates may not provide a fair assessment of actual market shares or trends. For example, in Figure 3 of Reference 14, Woods shows Marlboro 700 as a brand with a "higher" smoke pH and among those with the greatest change in sales. WINSTON 85 is shown among the brands with lower" smoke pH and a sales change near �ro. According to the 1971 Maxwell Report (15), which Woods used for his sales trends numbers, Marlboro 100 showed a 23.7% increase in volume relative to 1970. WINSTON 85, on the other hand, showed only a 1.5% volume increase. In actual volume, however, WINSTON 85 showed 65.42 billion units in 1971 versus 5.07 btffion units fot Marlboro 100. This translated to a 12 2% share for WINSTON 85, and a 0.9% share for Marlboro 100. Despite the ippearance of the trend hne in Figure 4, WINSTON 85 was by tar a better selling brand in 1971 thtn Marlboro 100,

These two questions regarding the data and methods used to generate the correlations reported certainly diminish the practical, if not statistical, significance of the correlations. For simplicity, Figures 2 and 4 in Woods1 report are the basis for the following discussion. Figures 1 and 3 from the same report show 100 mm brands only, and

A different way to examine the data presented is to divide the brands into market share "gainers" and 'losers'1 (above or below the "0** sales trend hne), and to further divide the brands into those with 'liigher" or "lower" pH (Figure 3). The range of smoke pH values appears to be about 5.88 to 6.50, wkh a midpoint at about 6.19. (No definition of what constitutes 'liigtr or 'low" pH has been reported; within the relatively narrow range of smoke pH shown in Woods1 report, use of the 6.19 as a midpoint is arbitrary.) hi this way, the graphs are divided into four quadrants, with losers/* lower1 pH" brands in the bottom left (Quadrant l\ ^gamers/'lowef* pH" brands in the upper left (Quadrant 2\ ugakers/'higher' pH brands in the upper right (Quadrant 3) and losers/'higher' pHT brands in the lower right (Quadrant 4). Figures 2 and 4 (Woods, Re� 14) show 29 brands common between them. (Figure 2,1972 showed 33 brands in all, Figure 4 for 1971 showed 30.) In both graphs, the 29 brands depicted represented 83 to 85% of all U.S. filtered cigarette brands, ox about 70% of the U.S. market at the time.

For 1971,10 brands each are included in Quadrants I and 2, and 8 brands are found in Quadrant 3. For 1972,9 brands are in Quadrant 1,11 in Quadrant 2, and S in Quadrant 3. In neither year were any brands in Quadrant 4. In 1971 and 1972, one brand, with about 0.5% market share, fell on the midpoint pH fine and was a sales "gamer". It was not included in either Quadrant 2 or 3 in this analysis.

By market share, the lower" pH quadrants, wkh sales "gainers" and losers" represented between 45.51 and 77.34% of the TOTAL cigarette market (not just filtered cigarettes), fine lower end of the share range accounts for the brands actually mefctded m Woods' report. The upper end accounts for those phis any other brands on the market that
pgNbr=340
were not included in the graph and not included in the 41ugher pH" group. Other ranges reported here were similarly derived]. Quadrant 3, with the "higher" pH brands, represented at least 22.66% of the TOTAL market, bat no more than 54.49%. hi 1972, there were shifts across quadrants, with at least 30.50% of the market consisting of lower" pH "gainers", and at least 13,96% consisting of nower" pH losers". "Lower**pH hrands thus represented at least 44.46% (and up to 75.30%) of the total U.S. cigarette market in 1972. The 8 "higher" pH brands of Quadrant 3 represented at feast 24.70% of the total market, but no more than about 55.5%. Therefore, while the graphs of [Woods'] Figures 1-4 give the impression that 'liigher" pH brands have higher sales, that is obviously not the case.

With one exception that will be discussed below, all RJR brands included hi the graphs were in the 'lower" pH quadrants. These brands represented 97% of RJR*s filtered cigarette brands k 1971, and 97.5% of its filtered bunds m 1971 (RJR's total market share �those yean was about 32.5 to 33% of the US, market,) lie exception noted above was VANTAGE 83, which was shown m die original Figure 2 (1972) as a liigher*' pH �fcainer," However, as VANTAGE was only introduced nationally in April of 1971, sales and pH data shown for 1972 would be from a relatively short tone frame. The sales data are also misleading due to the initial national distribution that would have taken place io 1971. The data for VANTAGE are therefore distorted and should not have been included in the correlation calculations,

All brands included in Quadrant 3 were made by one of two cigarette manufacturers. The collective sales growth of these brands continued beyond 1972 to about 1973, when market share for them Ifegan to decline, and by 1979, the market s3t*fe was below that of 1972. The present (1995) market share of this group of brands is less than two/thirds of its; 1972 share. Only two of the eight brands have a market share today greater than their share m 1972, and one of those two has been dedining in share since the mid 1980V The other brand with increased market share presently accounts for nearly half (47%) of the market share of the entire group (Quadrant 3).

Woods et a) aku addressed the smoke pH of commercial cigarettes m s second R&DM in 1973 (15). He compiled smoke pH data from various internal sources to track smoke pH over time. Data from 1964 through carry 1973 are reported for WINSTON, SALEM. Marlboro, Kent, Viceroy^ and fCooi (all 85 mm, soft pack styles)- Data are also reported for WINSTON, manufactured from 1955 to 1963, with pH measurements made in 1972 or 1973 on cigarettes that had been freezer-stored, but manufactured in the year reported The pH data available for all six cigarettes were "matched" with average 'tar1 and nicotine yields measured during the same year, but there is no indication that any of the smoke measurements was made on the same cigarette sample.

As mentioned in the "test methods11 section above, an additional conlbunder to the data series is that two, and perhaps three, different smoke pH methods were used during the period reported Woods said The pH measured by the pad method [1964 to 1967] is lower than that determined by the standard [electrode] method. However, since no reliable correction factor was available, the values were used as reported" (15). It also appears from the cited laboratory notebook pages that smoke pH data from 1969 to 1973 were measured by the same method used for the freezer stored cigarettes (1955-1963X*taw" pH method using 10 cigarettes), and by some other method not as easily discerned. The
pgNbr=341
latter values, however, were those reported for 1969 -1973. As a result, the smoke pH data in this report (15) appear to he based on three different test methods, It is therefore not surprising that variations in pH over time were seen. (The "standard [electrode) method" reported by Woods was also replaced by the "multiport method" a few years after Woods' reports, The 10-cigarette test eked above was a preliminary step toward that method. All smoke pH treads must be viewed with these many method changes in mind.)

Woods also reported that there was "a very strong positive correlation between smoke pH and sales trends ova the years studied" (IS). No statistical data supporting thin ihim are reported by Woods, and sales (in bithons of units) and smoke pli are depicted m separate graphs. Two brands that appear to show positive correlations are Marlboro and Kool,which were also among the iiigher pH/saks gainer" brands of Woods1 earlier . tfspoflL While each of these two brands showed continued sates growth for several yws Mowings Woods' memos, neither the increasing sales nor the 'lug^ smoke pH fi W �*stwued. None of the other brands included m this second report appeared to $fo<w a positive correlation Sales of aM six brands are bebw 1972 levels today.

p    Woods continued his analyst* of fitnok^pH and sales trends through 1974 (16) He /ported that 'Iwjith only a few exwptioos; brands with high srootas pfJ perfbm^fcfcetter 'y,w those with tow smoke pH," yet r,im!rtr4iio statistical data to r.ippou the ^ #elatioa.

Trends Since 1971

If (he smoke pH of RJR brands was increased in an effort to match the "*&$<# ^sales gain" brands described by Woods, routine smoke data generated over tht yu-A-fo&)wing,WoodY hypothesis would .show it. Figures 4 and 5 show smoke pH m\ sate? ih\ a for WJNSTON 85 and SAIBM �5, two of RJR's most popular brands in the earry iSJVO's. Through 1988, the last year for which the data were routinely generated, iheHf. was no consistent or sustained increase in smoke pli likewise, MaHhoro 8$ and Kooi 85, two of the major brands that allegedly fit Woods "higher pH/sales gun" criteria, did not sustain the higher smoke pH of the early 1970*8 (Figures 6-7). White both brands showed "peaks" in pH again tn the late 1970's, these peak vahies were not sustained nor measured again through the 1980's.

Figure 8 shows the smoke pH trends o( Marlboro 85 SP and WINSTON 85 SP Jrom 1977 to 1938, when multiple analyses by the same test method (^ntlfipoit") were

performed. The graph includes the yearly average smoke pH for each brand (solid Ike) and the 'lowest" and Tiighest" mdrvidua' measurement recorded over that year. The number of analyse, perform^ varied from year (o ye*, but over the yews, the smoke pH of each brand certainly overlapped with that of the other.

While the smoke pH measurement was disamimiied t& a routine analysis for dompetitrve and Company brands in the late 1980% a hilly complete data sot txtsts fw a number of brands in the 1977 to 1988 time period (18). These data were generated usfo*; ,onjy the '^Qniripoit" pH method. Flutes 9 - 20 show a mimbei of tuhei RJR blind* in graphs depleting average smoke pH measurements through this treoe period Again, th�ra is wo indication that any consistent changes in smoke #}t were made, ft does appear that StnokcpH variations across the brands were fekly corisisttt^ that k, dowmvaxa ^cwls appear in many brands at the same time. This �wy be tocttcative of atop- i&jw&m tfetf would affect the composition of all brands within a company &t nbm the swat, tln&ifc may be that brands from other companies wonkf. bo afJeotad sa a rMtr tmmfit, though �o( necessarily at the same time, since all ufe&&asu^wtafdar^sti&k�bi;eeo$i'%te$tft&^ 21 end 22 show various brands made by iUJK'K*itf-J^i^iMI6^rf flvwrjigc pH of those brasids as measured ^/epJJWr^lfi^ mcw brand mtrooucttous (after 1977) or dtfA�eiiaue�^9�j�^|ge^to market performance.

Marlboro ?U Bm% die current leading brand style in the U.S. cigarette iwfk&t \�; ih a 1995 market sharfc of about 7.4%, is the only ?>rand style of Woods' "Tiigher pH/side* gtitQcr" group that has maintained or increased tfiarket sWe'ifoeo 1972. Yel� as is rMcnS torn Figure 73, the smoke pH has decreas**! <*ver the }>eriod for which 4iU �Te avatiabfc. (Woods shows the brand on two graphs, but (Joes not report actual pH valuer It appears . to be around 6.40 for his graphs of 1971 and Wllt m&l?r\o those values reported ioi 1977-1979.) It is sJso obvtotts that the braotf \*as in its most steady s*te$ sneretse at thei time Woods* reported his findings (1971-1971).

iiaoke oH and Smoke Nkotine

hi several of his reports, Woods ihcorind thai the sales gains of bianOs wHh higher smoke pH might be because "the relative strength of the atca tine k tho smoke ^creased due to an increase m the amount of free nicotiae avBJbbfe" (H) H* also observed that 't�]n even better correlation was observed between fe mcotine m the smoke and sales" (15). Neither of these statements is supported by actual measuetrjeni of "free nicotine1* or reporting of the statistical correlation.

Woods reported "calculations" of unbound nicotine based on the smoke pH fur five of the six brands of his second memo (IS). However, the data are presented only in

graphical form, and it is not clear how those calculations were made. In addition, the pH data Gat Marlboro and Kent, which were not tested in the 1950's and early 1940's, were assumed for the calculations to be the same for those years as those of WINSTON. The smoke pH for SALEM and Kool were each assumed to be 6.0 throughout that period as well. Woods justified his assumptions regarding smoke pH based oa toUl sugar and total nitrogen data, though such data were available only since 1962 for total sugar, and since 1964 or 1969 for total nitrogen. No sugar or nitrogen data were reported for Kent, ft is unclear from the data what levels of total sugar and total nitrogen Woods would have considered significantly dtffiaejni enough for his pH assumptions not to be valid, but ;               variations across the brands are evident Nevertlwtess, Ac base ts^unption of tiose

calculations is that the nicotine would react in smoke the same way as it would man otherwise "clean1' aqueous solution. It is not fikety that this assumption would prove to be true. Until recently, there has been no method to measure unboumdnicotmem the smoke, Other reports in the literature, however, while mating assumption* shniUt to those of Wood (clean aqueous solution at 25C), calculated the percent of impropriated (unbound)

'                                                     Smoke pH has beem a topic of interest during various times within Research &

Development. It is obvious from the number of reports on test methc^logy durmg the 1960's and 1970*s that it is a measurement for which a consensus was never reached, and for which interpretation and meaning werequestiouwL Anatysis of smoke pHdatj since the early 1970's has shown that Woods1 hypothesis regarding smoke pH and safes trends was incorrect Not only did MR not act on his hypothesis and increase the smoke pH of

I                                         ks brands, but the competitive products cited by Woods to fit Us hypothesis did not'

sustain tie high smoke pH values measured it that time. Some of the competitive products declined ip sales as smoke pH decreased, while a few others contmued to gam market share while their smoke pH was declining. Low 'tar* brands that were just being introduced or were not even on the market at the time of Woods* reports are now among the market share leaders. Changing consumer tastes changed the sales trends of the foB-.    flavor brands popular in the early 1970**, not the pH of the smoke.

	unbound nicotine, affects the organoleptic
	:

	A.   Okay.  I have it.

14
	Q.   Was Claude Teague ever in charge of         I

15
	product development at Reynolds during his career?

16
	A.   No, he wasn't.

2        A.   (Reviewing document.)  Okay.

3        Q.   Directing your attention to Number 4, one

4   of the recommendations from Dr. Teague was "study,

5   design, and evaluate new or improved systems for

6   delivery of nicotine which would provide the

7   minimum satisfying amount of nicotine in attractive

9       products."

10             How does that recommendation compare to

11   recommendations from the Surgeon General and

12   Dr. Gori about developing a reduced risk cigarette?

13             MR. McPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

14        A,   I believe that would be consistent with

15   the concepts of having cigarettes that would yield

16   nicotine but would reduce exposure to toxicants.

4
	BY MR. LATHAM:

5
	Q.   Based on your review of internal company

6
	records and reports, for how long has Reynolds        j

7
	worked on trying to develop reduced risk

8
	cigarettes?

9
	A.   I believe that they've worked on that

10
	concept since the research department has existed,

11
	for many decades, since the 1950s.

12
	Q,   Is part of your job today to work on        [

13
	developing reduced risk cigarettes?

14
	A.   Yes.                                         |

15
	Q.   Can you tell the jury whether or not

16
	there was a premise that you and your colleagues      j

17
	have operated under with respect to whether smoking   j

18
	causes disease for purposes of product development?

19
	A.   Yes, there was.                             \

20
	Q.   What was the operating premise?

21
	A.   The operating premise was that the         j

22
	statistical associations that had been reported

23
	were, in fact, something that would eventually lead   [

24
	to a cause-and-effect relationship being             j

25  established.  In other words, that there could be     j

1   compounds present in the complex mixture, that is

2   cigarette smoke, that may be carcinogens or

3   mutagens that may contribute to disease.

4             So the operating premise was to try and

5   identify those and to try and develop cigarette

6   designs that would reduce exposure to those

7   compounds.

8        Q.   So even though Reynolds Tobacco took the

9   position that there was a statistical association

10   but it hadn't been scientifically proven that

11   smoking causes lung cancer, did that affect the

12   research and development department's efforts to

13   develop reduced risk cigarettes?

14             MR. McPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

15        A,   No, it didn't.

16   BY MR. LATHAM:

17        Q.   How do you know that?

18        A.   I know through the activities that have

19   gone on over the years and through the activities

20   that I've personally been involved in for the bulk

21   of my career.

23   of company records and reports, how long are you

24   aware that there was this operating premise within

25   R&D?

1       A.   I believe the operating premise existed

3   research and development department since at least

4   the 1950s.

5        Q.   Can you tell the jury some of the major

6   efforts that you're aware of that Reynolds has

8   smoke?

9        A.   Yes.  Those efforts have included

10   research and development activities in the area of

11   something called general reduction, in the area of

12   selective reduction, in the area of tobacco-heating

13   cigarettes, in the area of low T-to-N cigarettes,

14   and in the area of using fillers within the tobacco

15   blend.

16        Q.   Let's start with one of those, the

1   reduction begin?

2        A.   I believe it began in the 1950s.

3        Q.   Another concept you talked about was

4   general reduction.  What is general reduction?

5        A.   General reduction is broader.  Rather

6   than being focused on a single or a small group of

7   compounds, the concept is to develop technologies

8   that will reduce all of the constituents in smoke

9   and/or eliminate some.

10        Q.   Does general reduction include reducing

11   tar?

20   reducing tar, nicotine, and carcinogens through

21   general reduction?

22        A.   Since the 1950s.

6
	A.   In the first instance from 1889 the         j

7
	Surgeon General report says, "Studies have shown

8
	that smoking filtered, lower tar cigarettes reduces

9
	the risk of lung cancer compared with smoking         j

10
	unfiltered, higher tar cigarettes."

11
	And in the case of the 1990 Surgeon

12
	General's report, it says, "A lower risk of lung

13
	cancer has been observed for smokers of filtered      j

14
	cigarettes compared with smokers of nonfiltered      j

15
	cigarettes.  A pattern suggesting that the           \

16
	reduction in risk among former smokers may be more    j

17
	apparent for filtered cigarette smokers."

18
	Q.   Earlier in the deposition you talked       j

19
	about sources of information that may have affected

20

	that filtered or lower tar cigarettes were less

6
	Q.   And what impact would those kinds of

7
	recommendations have on Reynolds' product

9
	A.   They would have been carefully considered   f

10
	in terms of the underlying scientific information.

11
	Xhey would have either provided concepts for new

12
	directions potentially or confirming the directions   \

4   were a number of different technologies.

5        Q.   Do each of these technologies reduce the

6   tar and nicotine yields of Reynolds' cigarettes?

7        A.   Yes.  And they do in combination as well.

8        Q.   You talked at some length earlier in the

9   deposition about reconstituted tobacco.  Will you

10   explain for the jury what that is.

11        A.   Yes.  Reconstituted tobacco, it's

12   something that comes from a process.  The

13   reconstituted tobacco process is one that takes

14   small pieces of tobacco and makes them usable

15   within the tobacco blend.  So there can be parts of

16   the tobacco, the lamina or the stem, that are small

17   that are produced in manufacturing and cannot be

3
	Q.   Does using reconstituted tobacco in

4
	Reynolds' cigarettes reduce the tar and nicotine

5
	yields of the products?

6
	A.   Yes.  It's one of the technologies that

7
	will reduce the tar and nicotine.

8
	Q.   How does the amount of nicotine in the

9
	tobacco before it goes through the reconstituted

10
	tobacco process compare to the finished

11
	reconstituted tobacco?

12
	A.   It would be higher before it goes through

13
	the process.  There is some loss in the process.

14
	Q.   Is the amount of nicotine in the

15
	tobacco � the reconstituted tobacco less than in

16
	the tobacco leaf?

17
	A.   Yes.

18
	Q.   You mentioned another technology called

19
	expanded tobacco.  Does the use of expanded tobacco

20
	reduce the tar and nicotine yields in Reynolds'

	cigarettes?

	Does filter ventilation reduce the tar and nicotine   \

5
	A.   Yes, it does.

6
	Q.   How does it do that?

7
	A.   It does that by causing less tobacco in

8
	the tobacco column to be burned when the cigarette

9
	is puffed.  So rather than drawing all the air

10
	through the tobacco column, which is what promotes

11
	the combustion of tobacco, some of the puff volume,    j

12
	some of the air would come into the filter rather

13
	than the lit end of the cigarette.  As such, less     \

14
	tobacco would be burned, there would be less tar      j

15
	and nicotine, there would be less smoke.

16
	Q.   Has Reynolds looked at the question as to

17
	whether or not smokers block the vents on filters

18
	with their fingers or lips?

19
	A.   Yes.                                         |

20
	Q.   What is Reynolds' conclusion with respect

21
	to whether that happens?

22
	A.   Reynolds' conclusion -- scientists at

0 T
	Reynolds have done studies and it's been concluded    j

24
	that some smokers block some of the vents with

25

5        Q.   What was the NCI's Tobacco Working Group?

6        A.   The NCI -- the National Cancer Institute

7   Tobacco Working Group was a group that was formed

8   by the National Cancer Institute to try and look at

9   design technologies and create something that might

10   be termed a reduced risk or a safer type of

11   cigarette.

12             So it looked at individual cigarette

13   design technologies, in terms of what would happen

14   to the yield of smoke constituents, potential

15   toxicants; as well as the biological activity of

17   painting tests that Dr. Wynder had reported on

18   earlier.

19        Q.   Did Reynolds participate in the National

20   Cancer Institute's Less Hazardous Cigarette

	A.   Those tests were quite extensive.  They

23
	occurred over a decade or more roughly, in terms of

	Q.   You mentioned earlier in the deposition     f

2
	tobacco heating as an effort that Reynolds had

3
	tried to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.  Do

4
	you recall that?

	A.   I do, yes.                               1

6
	Q.   Can you tell the jury about significant

7
	examples in tobacco-heating cigarettes that

8
	Reynolds has worked on?

9
	A.   Yes.  Reynolds has done extensive          j

10
	research in that area for many, many years.

11
	Actually, most of the time that I've been with the

12
	company.  And it has resulted in two products that    I

13
	have gone to market; one was the name Premier and

14
	the other Eclipse.  And these are products that       j

15
	either didn't burn tobacco, only heated the

16
	tobacco; or may have primarily heated but burned a    l

17
	small amount of tobacco.  So they were designed

18
	such that by not burning significant amounts of       |

19
	tobacco, the yields of toxicants and constituents     |

20
	were reduced or eliminated.

	Q.
	What were the results of your testing of    j

11
	Premier?
	i;

12
	A.
	The results of the testing of Premier

13
	were that that cigarette design was one that
	
14
	significantly reduced the complexity of smoke.  It    j
	
15
	made a very simple cigarette smoke; one with a
	
16
	greatly
	reduced biological activity, and one that     j

17
	yielded
	little or no environmental tobacco smoke.     j

	A.
	It was, yes.

10
	reduce the risks of smoking?                        j

11
	A.   It tells me that the company was very

12
	committed in that regard; that they were willing      j

13
	to, when there seemed to be a viable path forward,

14
	produce a cigarette that would have less biological   j

15
	activity associated with the smoke and to make that

16
	available to smokers.  The key, though, being that

17
	smokers have to find it acceptable for it to have     j

18
	the potential to reduce the harms associated with

19
	smoking.

20
	Q.   Now, let's talk about Eclipse.  What was    j

21
	Eclipse?

22
	A.   Eclipse was something that followed         1

23
	Premier; in that rather than abandoning the concept   f

24
	after Premier, R.J. Reynolds wanted to learn from     j

25  that.  So the key was to try to have a design that    l

5   more acceptable to smokers.

8        Q.   What kinds of tests did Reynolds perform

9   on Eclipse?

10        A.   Tests similar to the ones I've described

11   before; that is, evaluation of the smoke chemistry, iz       evaluation oi tne oioiogicai activity or tne smoKe.

13   There were studies with smokers, clinical studies

14   were conducted, a wide range of studies.

17        A.   The results of testing Eclipse have shown

18   that the smoke constituents are greatly reduced, in

19   terms of compounds known to be possible or probable

20   or known carcinogens; that the biological activity

21   in a number of tests is reduced; and that when

22   smokers are switched from smoking their usual brand

23   of cigarette to smoking Eclipse, for example, for

24   24 weeks, their exposure to carcinogens was

	So the product is finely milled tobacco.    |

	It's tobacco that is heat treated rather than

10        A.   No, not that I'm aware of.

11        Q.   In this interoffice memorandum he

12   suggests going -- producing a cigarette that would

13   yield 29 milligrams of tar and 1.8 milligrams of

14   nicotine and suggests that would go back to the

15   1955-type cigarette.  Do you see that?

16        A.   I do see that at the bottom of the first jl i       page.

18        Q,   To the best of your knowledge what was

19   the yield of the Winston cigarette in the early

20   1970s, the tar yield?

21        A.   In the early 1970s it would have been

22   down probably 16, 17 milligrams per cigarette.

12   smoking causes lung cancer and a number of other

13   serious diseases.  But for many years, there were

14   different kinds of studies being conducted.  For

15   example, there was a statistical association that

16   was put forward, but there was not a mechanism

17   available.  The mechanism, as it turns out, has

18   been very hard, very difficult, very technically

1   General in 1964 on whether cigarette smoking was an

2   addiction?

3        A.   In 1964 the Surgeon General did not consider smoking to be an addiction, but rather a

o  naJoit �

6        Q.   In the 1970s what was the Surgeon

7   General's position on whether smoking was

8   addictive?

9        A.   It would have been the same.

11   Surgeon General on whether smoking was addictive?

12        A.   For most of the '80s it would have been

13   the same, but it changed during the 1980s.

14        Q.   How did it change in the 1980s?

15        A.   In the 1980s the definition for addiction

16   changed; and based on the new definition, the

17   Surgeon General concluded that cigarette smoking

18   was addictive.

21   want to just make sure the record is clear as to

22   what you meant when you said the documentation

	that finding, though, that tobacco use is the

5
	A.  As we've � in questions and answers

6
	from earlier, actually, they don't have that as a

7
	finding here.  They say, "According to the estimate

8
	of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"

9
	and they cite that figure.  That's the same figure    j

10
	that we discussed earlier in this deposition, that    j

11
	scientists from the FDA Center for Tobacco           [

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   So the Department of Health and Human

3   Services, the leading Public Health agency in the

4   United States, is citing the CDC's finding of

5   443,000 deaths per year, correct?

6        A.   Yes.  They're saying according to the

7   CDC, so they're acknowledging that the CDC has not

8   updated their figure.

9        Q.   How are they acknowledging that they

10   haven't updated their figure?

11        A.  Well, this is the most recent figure

12   that's been put forward by the CDC, as we've

13   discussed in earlier questions and answers.  It's

14   based on data from some years ago.  It hasn't been

15   updated, as I've indicated now a number of times.

16   The individual, the scientist from the Center for

17   Tobacco Products within the FDA, has published on

18   this last year; and the figure based on more recent

19   data would be about 380,000 per year.

20        Q.   So according -- then you're saying that

21   the Department of Health and Human Services is

22   wrong?

23        A.   I'm not saying anything of the kind.  I'm

24   merely giving you the facts as I understand them;

25   which is they're acknowledging the CDC's most

3         Q.   Surveys show that � they also talk about

4    "on average smoking shortens a smoker's life span

5    by 14 years."

6         A.I see that.

7         Q.   You don't disagree with that, right?

8         A.   I don't know that exact figure one way or

9    the other, but that's what they say here.

10         Q.   "Surveys show that approximately

11    70 percent of current smokers want to stop smoking

12    and nearly half of all smokers make a quit attempt

13    each year."  You don't disagree with that, right?

14         A.   I don't know the exact figures either,

15    but they cite those here.

16         Q.   All of the areas that Mr. Latham

17    addressed with you, you did not have any trouble

18    accepting.  Do you have trouble accepting that

19    finding by the Department of Health and Human

20    Services?

21         A.   I don't think they're finding it.

22    They're merely citing to a Reference Number 3 and

23    restating what is in that reference.

24         Q.   Okay.                                                                                                 p oi

	small percentage of smokers successfully quit each

12
	year."  You don't disagree with that, do you?        |

13
	A.   No.  I think that many smokers take

14
	repeated attempts, that not all smokers that try to

15
	quit smoking are successful in the first year.

16
	Tens of millions of smokers have quit smoking.

5   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

6        Q.   The testimony that I just read, the

7   questions and the answers where Mr. Hahn is stating

8   on behalf of the American Tobacco Company that

9   consumers should be able to rely on the statements

10   that the company makes about their cigarette

11   products, that would be consistent with your view

12   that consumers should be able to rely on the

14   cigarette products, correct?

15        A.   I believe the statements that I've made

16   would be in a somewhat different context than

17   what's being said here.  First of all, I think it's

18   Mr. Heimann that said it.

19             But secondly, what I've been quite clear

20   about is I think the company should put forward its

21   views in a straightforward manner and that those

22   should be relied upon as their views.  And that,

23   along with other information, are all things that

24   someone has the potential to consider.

25        Q.  And in that answer you did say they

	should rely upon the views of the company, correct?

2
	A.   I don't know what you mean by the word

3
	"rely"; but they should be able to recognize that     [

4
	the company is putting forward its views, yes.

14        A.   If I understand your hypothetical, I

16             But what I would say is, first of all, my

17   recollection of the question I was asked was about

18   warning labels, complying with the warning label

19   requirements.  Your question in your hypothetical

20   seemed to be far broader.  The responsibility for

21   different forms of compliance may be in different

22   departments.  It depends upon what it is.

23             What I do know is that in the time that

7   they were.  Why would you be talking about how

8   public they were if you haven't seen them?

9        A.   They are publicly available.  I haven't

10   read every patent.

11        Q.   Right.  But you talked about, "we've

13   everyone to see."  If you don't know what's in

14   them, why would you be highlighting the fact that

15   they're public?

16             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17        A.   It's a fact.  It was a question, "Are

10
	came to the conclusion here today that that was       j

11
	never implemented in any cigarette; and what I'm      \

	before you got there?

16
	A.   No.  My view is based on the two things

17
	that I just tried to indicate to you in the last     j

18
	couple of answers.  That is, number one, I've never   |

19
	seen any evidence that such a thing was implemented

2        Q.   And R.J. Reynolds has known since the

3   early 1950s that there were compounds in cigarettes

4   and cigarette smoke that were known carcinogens,

5   correct?

6        A.   If by "known carcinogen," you mean that

7   they may be an animal carcinogen or a possible or

8   probable human carcinogens, yes, there have been

9   compounds that have been identified since the '50s id       trist would. De in tnat general category.

11        Q.   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is that

12   a compound that's on the iarc list?

13        A.   Those would be a class of compounds;

14   there would be various compounds in that class.

15   But some compounds within that class would be on

16   the IARC list, yes.

17        Q.   So PAHs, polycyclic aromatic

18   hydrocarbons, is on the IARC list?

22
	A.
	Since the 1950s?  In the 1950s there was

23
	a focus
	on some of the pHs.  Following that there

24

	nitrosamines.  They were identified I believe early   j

3    that, right?

4          A.   I think -- yes, I think accurate

5    information should be provided.  In this case we're

14               MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15         A.   Harm is a different concept and has many

16    factors that go into it, as I understand harm.  I

17    wouldn't agree with your statement, as you've

18    indicated.

2         A,   Ye s.

3         Q.   So if nicotine is the dominant desire,

4   that would mean that nicotine is desired over other

6         A.   In your hypothetical.  This is

7   Dr. Teague's opinion.  It's not necessarily fact.

8         Q.   Well, it's not my hypothetical.  It's

9   Dr. Teague's conclusion, correct?

10         A.   He's stating his belief.  I don't know

11   that it's his conclusion.  I haven't read through

12   the whole document.  But it says, as you read

14         Q.   Okay.  "There are wide varieties of

15   foods, beverages, and confections from which a

16   variety of flavor and other satisfactions may be

17   obtained, if that were the dominant desire.  But

18   tobacco products alone provide nicotine

19    satisfaction; therefore, that is the primary

20   reasons smokers smoke.  What the smoker basically

21   wants, I believe, is nicotine satisfaction

22   accompanied by acceptable flavor and mildness.

23   Therefore, in designing any cigarette product, the

24   dominant specification should be nicotine                               jj g

	Q.   Dr. Teacrue is savincr  clearlv that the

4
	primary reason that people smoke is the need for

6
	A.   He's saying he believes that; he's not

11
	A.   Yes.  He was in the research department     j

12
	at that time, I believe.

13
	Q.   Okay.  And he's talking about designing

14
	the cigarette product around the specification of     j

15
	nicotine delivery, correct?

16
	A.   He's talking about hypothetical and

17
	about his opinions.  He's not specifying, in what     l

18
	I've read so far, a particular design.  He's          \

	desired" -- "below that desired by the smoker."

11
	That's what he said, correct?

12
	A.  That's what he said here, yes.  You've

13
	read it correctly.                                  j

14
	Q.   He is providing significant detail about    j

16
	nicotine in their cigarette, COrrect?                |

17
	A.   He's providing speculation.  He says in     \

	theory and he believes probably in fact, and he      \

	states the things that you've read.

3
	A.   I don't recall it being specified in that   j

4
	way.  I think the question was around reduced         \

5
	levels of tar and nicotine.  I believe, if I recall   j

6
	the questions, they were about were there some

7
	brands that had very low levels.  And I believe my

8
	answers were along the lines of for brands such as

9
	Now and Carlton, for certain brand styles there,

10
	they were not measurable by the standard testing

11

8   correct?

9        A.   I believe that that logic would be

10   correct, yes.

	Q.   Right.  She looked at R.J. Reynolds'

2
	tracKing or pn ano. cigarette sales over many, many    i

3
	years, right?                                      \

4
	A.   No.  She looked at different kinds of

5
	data that were generated for different purposes

6
	over the years.  There was an ongoing program to      |

7
	evaluate Reynolds' products and competitive

8
	products on a number of different things over the     j

9
	years.  One of those was smoke pH.                   \

10
	There were also, independent of that,       |

11
	sales data.  And my understanding is Ms. Lewis

12
	looked at those at this point in time together to     \

13
	see if the kinds of views that were being put         j

14
	forward were true or not.

15
	Q.   Do you know why she did that in 1996?       1

	"review internal reports regarding cigarette smoke,

	pH methodology, and the relationship of smoke pH to

24
	cigarette trends."                                j

8        A,   We can have my earlier answer read back,

9   but generally I believe that what they did was

10   recognize that the statistical association that had

11   been reported was something that with additional

12   research may be true, and that there may be

13   compounds present in smoke that were associated

14   with risk and that they were trying to identify

15   what those may be and to identify new designs that

16   may reduce the risks or the exposure to those

18   over the years.

19        Q.   So when Dr. Senkus, who is the director

20   of research and development at R.J. Reynolds

21   Tobacco Company in 1968, says to the National

22   Cancer Institute, "I am agreeable to serving on the

23   informal work group referred to by you and making

9        A.   Yes.  I believe he's articulating

10   something about the fact that the mechanism still

11   had not been established.  At the same time his

12   participation for more than ten years in that

13   effort I think shows very clearly that it was the

14   operating premise.  And as I also indicated, there

15   was indication from the president of the company

16   that such activities should be pursued to their

17   greatest extent.

8   scientist in research and development, whether

9   their product that their company is making is

10   popular with teenagers?

11        A.   It's very important to me that we don't

12   want anyone underage using tobacco products, and we

13   want to accelerate the decline in the use of

14   underage tobacco products.  Underage use is at a

15   historic low.  We want it to go faster and lower.

16        Q.   Earlier you talked about Camel No. 9, a

17   particular marketing campaign from Reynolds,

19       A,   I answered questions around Camel No. 9. Zv                  Q.   Right.  And you said that you really

21   didn't get involved � strike that.

22             pri0r to that you talked about how you

23   really didn't get involved in marketing and you

24   don't know much about the marketing in the company.

25        A.   I answered the questions that were asked.

14        Q.   It says, "CTR has helped our legal

15   counsel by giving advice and technical information

16   which was needed at court trials.  CTR has supplied

17   spokesmen for the industry at congressional

18   hearings.  The money spent at CTR provides a base

19   for introduction of witnesses.  Bill Shinn feels

20   that special projects are the best way that monies

21   are spent.  On these projects, CTR has acted as a

22   'front.'  However, there are times when CTR has

23   been reluctant to serve in that capacity, and in

24   rare instances they have refused to serve in that

25   capacity."

3        A.   It says, "Attached are position papers

5   additives in RJRT tobacco flavor formulations."

7        A,   One of them is, yes.

9   on our discussion on July 16th, 1982, we did not

10   prepare a position paper on coumarin."

11             So we know that this document is at least

	reduced so that the tobacco could actually be used

�"...for practical purposes, a filter-tip capable of filtering out 40 percent of the tar would be a step in the right direction..."

�"'Such a filter tip,.,placed on a regular-sized cigarette which normally yields 30 milligrams of tar in its smoke, would reduce the smoker's tar exposure to about 18 milligrams. A reduction to that level, as shown both by animal experiments and human statistical studies, would be a significant reduction in cancer risk."3

George $, 40 year* oW and t padc-a-dty smoker sine* colkgt, had tried numerous times to break the cigarette habit, without n�ceae."I guess I'm hooked," he told hit wife. "But m Uststttey dra't seta to hurt me." Thus, when the offer of a new Job te�

Sired George to past a physical, he raced :�*miiiadoow^ciM^cfl<^U(jtiJtftt doctor lowered his stethoscope and shook tut head otntaooaly. "I don't like the sound of thai left lung, well check it on yoor *w, fat, if I were /on, rd itop amokfag."

To George's relief, die t-my proved negative. Bat the scare ww i�il enough to

office, he ciioppedhlia^retttt in the n�*mt trash basket�tod hasVt stocked since.

like George, about a tnillionand a kail Americans swear off stocking each ytat. Some od their doctor's advice; others became their own common tense tells them ir fa ridiculous to take the riib hv volvtd. Yet tew of millions continue to smoke, either because they are unable or unwilling to quit

Ggarctte smoking it we know it ii a habit that or%imted only ibout 60 ytan ito. At thtt lime king cancer was a rate disease. Today, among American roe*, it is the leading cause of death from cancer �and it graving in epidemic proportions.

Srudiea show that the risk or death from lung cancer it 10 tunes greater for the average mate smoker than for the 000* smoker. Another recent study reveals that hjng cancer is also on the upswing among women, with those who smoke a pack or snore a day having a death rate op to five rimes higher than oontmoJntrt

The most chilling aspect of long cancer Is that cures are rare Ninety-five one of erery 100 people who ret hmg cancer are dead within 5 yean, Even die first-year survival rate is only 25 percent

Emphysema, a crippling hiog disease, and duooic bronchitis are hard to tell apart because their symptoms are similar� shortness of breath, chronic cough and the tendency to tire easily. Emphysema creeps up on ks victims almost unnoticed. The air sacs lose their ehatkity.'tuptixtt; and used air becomes trapped in the

SOURCES OF STATISTICS

Incidence

Since there li no national office which records every new cancer case, there is no way of knowing exactly how many new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year. In the past, estimate* of cancer incidence were made by extrapolating from the experience of the few population-based cancer registries.

Estimates of Incidence In Facta * ffeure* editions prior to 1974 were bated on data from two state cancer registries, The lisue* from 1974 through 1971 used Information from the National Cancer Institute's Third National Cancer Survey <m9-797i) of nine major areas of iht United Stales.

Then In 197), NCI began a new and larger program, gathering data from 11 populatkm-bawd reglitrkn. It I* called Sf Eft, standing for Sunw4ltance� Epidemiology and Cnd ftesults. Beginning with the 1979 edition of reefs A Figures, SECR Incidence information has been used, fech time a new data base is Introduced, there may be some sharp changes In figures, do* to the more accurate data. The changes do MOT Indicate ehher a cancer epidemic or miracle cure.

For valid compariiom between yurt, Incidence statistics from the 1974 through 1971 editions of fsctt * figures may be compared

with one another, while those from the 1979 to 1984 edition* may be compared

The latest available information for this 1987 edition it SEfR data from the year* 1981-19*3.

Mortally

The source for mortality statistics has remained constant over the years: the National Center for Health Statistics, Department of Health and Human Services.

The 1907 figures are estimates based on the latest available information, which includes mortality data through 1983.

Beginning with the 1981 edition of facts A figures, mortality rates per 100,000 population were ag**adjuned to the 1970 census population, rather than the 1940 census population. Comparing these charts and figure! with those of previous years may Indicate false trends.

Survival

Because of the 5-year waiting period, survival ststlitlcs takelongei to compile. In this edition, we show the latest survival rates for cases diagnosed In the period 1977-B3I In the Sf Eft program.

CANCER: BASIC DATA

BASIC DATA

What is cancer?

Cancer if a large group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If Ihe spread is not controlled or checked, it results in death. However, many cancers can be cured if detected and treated promptly.

How is cancer treated?

By surgery, radiation, radioactive substances, chemicals, hormones and immunotherapy.

Who gels cancer?

Cancer strikes at any age. It kills more children 3 to 14 than any other disease. And cancer strikes more frequently with advancing age. In the 1970'a, there were an estimated 35 million cancer deaths, over 6,5 million new cancer cases, and more than 10 million people under medical care for cancer.

How many people alive today will get cancer?

About 74 million Americans now living will eventually have cancer; about 30%, according to present rates. Over the years, cancer will strike in approximately three out of four families.

How many people alive today have ever had cancer?

There are over 5 million Americans ative today who have a history of cancer, 3 million of them with diagnosis five or more years ago. Most of these 3 million can be considered cured while others stfil have evidence of cancer. By "cured" is meant that a patient has no evidence of disease and has the same life expectancy as a person who never had cancer.

The decision as to when a*patient may be considered cured is one that must be made by the physician after examining the Individual patient For most forms of cancer, five years without symptoms following treatment is the accepted time. However, some patients can be considered cured after one year, others after three years, whereas some have to be followed much longer than five years.

How many new cases wiH there be this year?

In 1967 about 965,000 people will be diagnosed as having cancer.*

How many people are surviving cancer?

In the early 1900** few cancer patients had any hope of long-term survival. In the 1930Js less than one in five was alive at least five years after treatment, In the 1940's it was one in four, and in the 1%0's it was one in three.

Today, about 385,000 Americans, or 4 out of 10 patients who get cancer this year, will be aHve 5 years after diagnosis. The gain from 1 in 3 to 4 in 10 represents about 65,000 persons this year. This 4 in 10, or about 40% is called the "observed survival rate. When normal life expectancy is taken into consideration (factors such as dying of heart disease, accidents and diseases of old age) 49% will be alive 5 years after diagnosis. This is the "relative" survival ratev and is considered a more accurate yardstick of our battle against cancer.

Could more people be saved?

Yes. About 170,000 people with cancer will probably die in 1987 who might have been saved by earlier dlag-nosis and prompt treatment

How many people wfU die?

This year about 483,000 will die of the disease-1323 people a day, about one every 65 seconds. Of every five deaths from all causes in the US* one is from cancer. In 1986 an estimated 472,000 Americans died of cancer. In 1985 it was 462JOOO; in 1984 the figure was 453,492.

What Is the national death rate?

There has been a steady rise in Ihe age-adjusted" national death rate In 1930 the number of cancer deaths per 100,000 population was 143. In 1940 it was 152 By 1950 it had risen to 158 and in 1984 the number was 170. The major cause of these increases has been cancer of the lung. Except for that form of cancer, age-adjusted cancer death rates for major sites are leveling oft and in some cases declining.

Can cancer be prevented?

Some cancers, not all Moat lung cancers are caused by cigarette smoking, and moat skin cancers by frequent overexposure %o direct sunlight These cancers can be prevented by avoiding their causes. Certain cancers caused by occurMtk^al-erivironmental factors can be prevented by eliminating or reducing contact with carcinogenic agents. See Prevention section, pp. 18-22.

HOW CANCER WORKS

Normally, the cells that make up the body reproduce themselves in an orderly manner so that worn-out tissues are replaced, Injuries are repaired and growth of the body proceeds.

Occasionally, certain cells undergo an abnormal change and begin a process of uncontrolled growth and spread: One cell divides into two, those redivide into four, and so on. These cells may grow into masses of tissue called tumors�some benign and others malignant (cancerous).

The danger of cancer is that it invades and destroys normal tissue. In the beginning, cancer cells usually remain at their original site, and the cancer is said to be localized. Later, some cancer cells may invade neighboring organs or tissue. This occurs either by

direct extension of growth or by becoming detached and carried through the jymph or blood systems to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis of a cancer.

This spread may be regional�confined to one region of the body�when ceHs are trapped by lymph nodes. If left untreated, however, the cancer is likely to spread throughout the body. That condition is known as advanced cancer, and usually results in death.

Because a case of cancer becomes progressively more serious with each stags, it is important to detect cancer as early as possible. Aids to early detection include cancer's Seven Warning Signals and the cancer rbk factors.

TRENDS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

The diagnosis and treatment of cancer has become increasingly individualized. Early detection is followed by more precise staging, and the use of more than one kind of therapy, often in combination.

Some cancers, which only a few decades ago had a very poor outlook, are today being cured: acute lymphocytic leukemia in children, Hodgkin's disease, ftarkitt's lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma (a form of bone cancer), Wilms' tumor (a kidney cancer in children), rhabdomyosarcoma (a cancer in certain muscle tissue), choriocarcinoma (placental cancer), testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and osteogenic sarcoma. Other cancers have not yet yielded to effective treatment, and are the focus of continuing research.

An outstanding example of progress is the improve* ment in the management of testicular cancer in young men. More precise diagnostic tools and staging allow better selection of treatment. The use of combinations of cancer drugs has resulted in remarkably improved survival. In 20 years, the 5-year survival rate of testicular cancer rose from 63% to &8%.

The following developments indicate the directions of current and future research:

* A genetic fusing of cariceT cells with normal cells can produce disease-fighting "monoclonal antibodies"� specific antibodies tailored to seek out chosen targets on cancer cells. The potential of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer is under study.

* New understanding of the causes of pain in cancer patients has increased the options for control Regular use of oral pain medicines, infusions or injections of analgesics, procedures to interrupt pain pathways, are among the effective approaches available to control pain in cancer patients.

* Studies with agents like synthetic retinoids (cousins of Vitamin A), and other substances are being under* taken to see if recurrences of certain cancers can be prevented. Another step is to see if these agents

can reduce cancer in high risk groups. For example, studies of dietary intervention will examine the effect oi low-fat diets in women at high risk of developing breast cancer.

* New approaches to drug therapy use combination chemotherapy and chemotherapy with surgery. New classes of agents axe being tested for their effectiveness in treating patients resistant to drug therapies now in use.

* Many patients with primary bone cancer now are treated successfully by removing and replacing a section of bone rather than by amputating the leg or arm Drugs and radiation therapy are being used effectively in bone cancer surgery, resulting hi dramatic improvement in survival

� New high technology diagnostic imaging techniques have replaced exploratory surgery for some cancer patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR!) ts one example of such technology under study, tt uses a huge electromagnet to detect tumors by sensing the vibrations of the different atoms in the body. MR] could revolutionize the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. Computerized tomography (CT scanning) uses X rays to examine the brain and other parts of the body. Cross-section pictures are constructed which show a tumor's shape and location more accurately than Is possible with conventional x-ray techniques. For patients undergoing radiation therapy, CT scanning may enable the therapist to pinpoint the tumor more precisely to provide mora accurate radiation dosage while sparing norma) tissue.

� Immunotherapy holds the hope of enhancing the body's own disease-fighting systems to control cancer. Interferon, taterjeiikin-2 and other biologic response modifiers are under study. Recently, interferon was made available as the treatment for hairy cell leukemia, a rare blood cancer of older Americans. The exciting research area of biologic

onse modifiers will probably require many years nd the proper role of these agents in cancer ment.

y cancers are caused by a two-stage process igh exposure to substances known as initiators womoters. Research scientists are exploring ways iterrupting these processes to prevent the lopment of cancer.

transfusion of blood components is becoming asingly available and effective as a support in �r therapy. Platelets are used to prevent hem-tging, and red blood cells, to combat anemia, rions, a common complication in cancer patients, tow be better anticipated, and with new drugs intibodies, better controlled and treated, technologies have made it possible to use bone }w transplantation as an important treatment n in selected patients with aplastic anemia and mia. Bone marrow transplantation for other �rs is under study. The administration of larger of anticancer drugs or radiation therapy may lerated by some patients if their bone marrow red and later transplanted to restore marrow ion (autologous bone marrow transplants), rthermia is a way to increase the heat or �rature of the entire body or a part of the body, known that heat can kill cancer cells. A cell �rature of 45 degrees kills cancer cells. A tem-

perature of 42-43 degrees makes the cell more susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation (X rays). Studies are underway to learn if hyperthermia can increase the effect of radiation or chemotherapy,

* With medical progress producing longer survival periods for many cancer patients, clinical concerns are expanding to include not only patients' physical well-being bul also their psychosocial needs. The patient's and family's reactions to the disease, sexual concems, employment and insurance needs, and ways to provide psychosocial support, have emerged as important areas of research and clinical care. Health professionals have become increasingly interested in quality-of-life issues for cancer patients and their families.

" Improvements in cancer treatment have made possible more conservative management of some early cancers. In early cancer of the larynx, many patients have been able to retain their larynx and their voice; in colorectal cancer, fewer permanent colostomies are needed; and the surgery required in many cases of breast cancer is often more limited

? Prostatic ultrasound, a rectal probe using ultrasonic waves producing an image of the prostate, is currently being Investigated as a potential means to increase the early detection of occult, or not clinically suspected, prostate cancer.

LUNG CANCER

Incidence An estimated 150,000 new cases in 1987. The incidence rate in white male* dropped from 82.7 per 100,000 in 1982 to 79.3 in 1983, However, the incidence rate in white females and in black mates and females continued to rise.

Mortality: An estimated 136,000 deaths in 1967. The age<-standardized lung cancer death rate for women b higher than that of any other cancer. It has surpassed breast cancer which for over 50 years was the number one cancer killer of women.

Wanting Signals: A persistent cough; sputum streaked with blood; chest pain; recurring attacks of pneumonia or bronchitis.

Risk Factors: Cigarette smoking; history of smoking 20 or more years; exposure to certain Industrial substances such as asbestos, particularly for those who smoke. Involuntary smoking increases the risk. Exposure to radiation may also contribute to lung cancer.

Early Detection: Lung cancer is very difficult to detect early; symptoms often don't appear until the disease has advanced considerably. If a smoker quits at the time of early precancerous cellular changes, the

damaged bronchial lining often returns to normal If a smoker continues the habit, cells may form abnormal growth patterns that lead to cancer. Diagnosis may be aided by such procedures as the chest X ray, sputum cytology test and fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

Treatment: Treatment depends on the type of, and stage of lung cancer. Surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are all options. For many localized cancers, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. Since the majority of patients with lung cancer have tumor spread, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are often combined with surgery. In small eel) cancer of the lung, chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation has largely replaced surgery as the treatment of choice, with a large percentage of patients experiencing remission�in some cases, long-lasting remission.

Survival: Only 13% of lung cancer patients (all stages, whites and blacks) live five or more years alter diagnosis. The rate is 33% for cases detected in m localized stage; but only 24% of lung cancers are discovered that early. Rates have Improved only slightly over a recent 10-year period.

COLON AND RECTUM CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 145,000 new cases in 1987, including 102/300 of colon cancer and 43,000 of rectum cancer. Their combined incidence is second only to that of lung cancer (excluding common skin cancers).

Mortality: An estimated 60,000 deaths in 1967, second only to lung cancer. This includes 52,000 for colon cancer and &Q0O foe rectum cancer.

Warning Signals: Bleeding from the rectum, blood in the stooX change in bowefhabits.

Risk Factors: Personal or family history of colon and rectum cancer, personal or family history of polyps in the colon or rectuni Inflammatory bowel disease.

Evidence suggests that bowel cancer may be linked to the diet A diet high in fat and/or low in fiber content may be a significant causative factor.

Early Detection: The ACS recommends three tests as valuable aids in detecting colon and rectum cancer early in people without symptoms.

The digital rectal examination is performed by a physician during an office visit. The ACS recommends one every year after age 40.

The stool Mood slide test is a simple method of testing the feces for hidden blood. The specimen is obtained by the patient at home, and returned to the physician's office, a hospital or clinic for examination. The ACS recommends the test every year after 50,

Proctosigmoidoscopy, known as the "procto," is an examination in whkh a physician inspects the rectum

and lower colon with a hoBow lighted tube. As the site of most colorectal cancers appears to be shifting higher in the colon, longer, flexible Instruments are being used as well as the rigid scope. The ACS rec*

of 50, following two annual normal exama.

If any of these tests reveals possible problems, a physician may recommend more extensive studies, such as ccJonoscopy and i barium enema. Colono-scopes view the entire colon.   .

Treatment: Surgery, at times combined with radiation, is the most effective method of treating colorectal cancer. Chemotherapy is being studied to determine its possible role in treating advanced cases.

In cases of colon cancer, a permanent colostomy, the creation of an abdominal opening for the elimination of body wastes, is seldom needed, and is infrequently required for patients with rectal cancer. One report found permanent colostomies necessary for only 15% of patients whose rectal cancers are detected early. For those who do have permanent colostomies, the Society has a special patient assistance program. (See p. 24)

Survival: When colorectal cancer is detected and treated in an early, localised stage, the 5-year survival rate it 86% for colon cancer and 77% for rectal cancer, compared with 39% and 31% respectively, after the cancer has spread to other parts ofthe body.

BREAST CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 130,000 new cases in the United States during 1967. About one out of 10 women will develop breast canter at some time during her life.

Mortality; An estimated 41300 deaths (HOOD females; 300 males) in 1987, in female*, second only to lung cancer, now the foremost site of cancer deaths in women.

Warning Signals: Breast changes that persist such as a lump, thickening, {welling, dimpling, skin Irritation, distortion, retraction or scaliness of the nipple, nipple discharge, pain or tenderness.

Risk Factors: Over age 50; personal or family history of breast cancer; never had children; first child after age 30.

Early Detection: The American Cancer Society recommends the monthly practice of breast self-examination (BSE) by women 20 years and older as a routine good health habit. Most breast lump* are not cancer, but only a physician can make a diagnosis.

The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, in their joint Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration program, found that mammography� a low-dose x*ray examination�could find cancers too small to be felt by the most experienced examiner.

Besides its effectiveness in screening women without symptoms, mammography is recognized as a valuable diagnostic technique for women who do have findings suggestive o( breast cancer. Once a breast lump Is found, inarnrnography can help determine if there are other lesions in tne same or opposite breast which are too small to be felt. All suspicious lumps should

be biopsied for a definitive diagnosis�even when the mammogram is described as normal.

The Society recommends a mammogram every year for asymptomatic women age SO and over, and a baseline mammogram for those 35 to 39. Asymptomatic women 40 to 49 should have mammography every 1*2 years. In addition, a professional physical examination of the breast is recommended every three years for women 20 to 40, and every year for those over 40.

Treatment: Several methods may be used, depending on the individual woman's preferences and medical situation�surgery varying from local removal of the tumor to mastectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone manipulation. Often two or more methods may be used in combination. Patients should discuss with their physicians possible options available concerning the specific management of their breast cancer.

New techniques in recent years have made breast reconstruction possible after mastectomy, and the cosmetic results are good. Reconstruction now has be* come an important part of treatment and rehabilitation. (See p. 24)

Survival: The 5-year survival rate for localized breast cancer has risen from 78% In the 1940% to 90% today. If the breast cancer is not invasive {in situ), the survival rate approaches 100%. If the cancer has spread, however, the rate is 60%.

Despite an increasing Incidence of breast cancer, longer survival has helped to stabilize mortality rates over the last 50 years.

UTERINE CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 48,000 new invasive cases in 1987, including 13,000 cases of cancer of the cervix, and 35,000 cases of cancer of the endometrium or body of the uterus. Invasive cervical cancer incidence has steadily decreased over the years, while cancer in situ has risen in all groups. CervicU cancer is most common today among low socioeconomic groups but aU groups are at risk. Endometrial cancer afflicts mostly mature women, and diagnosis usually is made between the ages of 55 and 69*

Mortality: An estimated 6,800 deaths in 1987 from cervical cancer, 2,900 from endometrial cancer. Overall, the death rate from uterine cancer has decreased more than 70% during the last 40 years, due mainly to the Pap test and regular checkups.

Warning Signals: Intermenstrual or postmenopausal bleeding or unusual discharge.

Risk Factors: For cervical cancer: early age at first intercourse, multiple sex partners. For endometrial cancer: history of infertility, failure of ovulation, prolonged estrogen therapy and obesity.

Early Detection: The Pap test, an examination under a microscope of ceils from the cervix and body of the

uterus, is a simple procedure which can be performed at appropriate interval* by physician* as part of every pelvic examination. For the average risk person, a Pap test is recommended once every three years after two initial negative tests one year apart.

The Pap test is highly effective in detecting early cancer of the uterine cervix; it is only 50% effective in detecting endometrial cancer. Women at high risk of developing endometrial cancer should have an endometrial tissue sample at menopause.

The hormone estrogen frequently js given to women during and after menopause to make up for the decline in estrogens normally produced by the ovaries. Estrogen helps to control menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes or thinning of the vaginal lining causing painful sexual intercourse. For mature women, there are certain risks associated with such treatment,

Women and their physician* should carefully discuss the use of postmenopausal estrogens in terms of the benefit and risk to the individual patient.

In precancerous (in situ) stages, changes in the cervix may be treated by cryotherapy (the destruction of cells by extreme cold! by electrocoagulation (the destruction of tissue through intense heat by electric current) or by local surgery. Precancerous endometrial changes may be treated with the hormone progesterone. Survival: The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer

patients, whites and blacks, is 66%, For patients diagnosed early, however, the rate is 80-90%. Cancer in situ is virtually 100%. The figures for endometrial cancer are 83% all stages, 91% early and virtually 100% for endometrial precancerous lesions. During a recent 10-year period, there was moderate improvement fat both uterine sites.

OVARIAN CANCER

Incidence; An estimated 19,000 new cases in the United States in 1987. It is estimated that about 1.4% or one out of every 70 newborn girls will develop ovarian cancer during her lifetime. It accounts for 4% of all cancers among women and 27% of the cancers of the female reproductive system.

Mortality. An estimated 11,700 deaths in 1987. Although ovarian cancer ranks second in incidence among gynecological cancers, it causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.

Warning Signals: Ovarian cancer is often "silent;" showing no obvious signs or symptoms until late in its development. The most common sign is an enlarged abdomen caused by the collection of fluid. Rarely will there be abnormal vaginal bleeding. In women over 40, vague digestive disturbances (stomach discomfort, gas, distention) which persist and cannot be explained by any other cause may indicate the need for a thorough checkup for ovarian cancer.

Rkk Factors: Risk for ovarian cancer increases with age, with highest rates for women 65-81 Women who have never had children are twice as likely to develop ovarian cancer as those who have. A number of interrelated reproductive factors, such as age at first live birth, age at first pregnancy, and number of pregnancies are all involved in varying degrees. In addition, years of ovulation, the product of a number of other interrelated factors such as age at mcnarche, age at menopause, length of pregnancies and oral contraceptive use (which may themselves actually decrease risk),

are also tied to an observed increased risk, Breast and endometrial cancer increases a woman's chances of developing ovarian cancer twofold. Patients with colorectal cancer are at increased risk of ovarian cancer, although risk decreases over time following diagnosis of their colorectal cancer. Some rare genetic disorders are associated with increased risk. Incidence rates are higher in North America and Northern Europe, and lower in Asia and Africa, Rates are significantly higher for nuns, Jewish women, and women who have never been married. Early Detection] Periodic, thorough pelvic examina-

cancer, does not reveal ootrrm oncer. Women over the age of 40 should have a cancer-related checkup every year.

Treatment: Surgery, radiation therapy and drug ther* apy are all options in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Surgical treatment usually includes the removal of one or both ovaries, the uterus (hysterectomy) and the fallopian tubes. In some very early tumors, only the Involved ovary may be removed, especially in young women, In advanced disease, an attempt is made to remove all intra-abdominal disease to enhance the effec t of chemotherapy*

Survival: If ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated early, about 85% of such patients live 5 years or longer. However, when diagnosed in an advanced stage, the survival rate drops to 22%. It has improved with modem chemotherapeutk agents. Overall the survival rate for ovarian cancer is 38%.

ORAL CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 30,000 new cases'in 1987. Incidence is more than twice as high in males as in females, and is most frequent in men over age 40. Cancer can affect any part of the oral cavity, from lip to tongue to mouth and throat.

Mortality: An estimated 9,400 deaths in 1987.

Warning Signals: A sore that bleeds easily and doesn't heafc a lump or thicl�rvmg; a reddish or whitish patch that persists. Difficulty in chewing swallowing or moving tongue or Jaws are often late changes.

Risk Factorst Cigarette, cigar and pipe smoking; use of smokeless tobacco; excess use of alcohol

Early Detection! Dentists and primary cart physician* have the opportunity, during regular checkups, to see abnormal tissue changes and to detect cancer at an early and curable stage

Treatment: Principal methods are radiation therapy and surgery. Chemotherapy Is being studied as an aid to surgery in advanced disease,

depending on the site Rate* range from 32% for cancer of the pharynx to 91% for Up cancer. Overall, 5-year survival for oral cancer patients is about 51%.

Incidence: An estimated 96,000 new cases in the United States during 1987. About one out of 11 men will develop prostate cancer at some time during his lifetime. The third highest incidence of cancer in men, next to skin cancer and tuns: cancer.

Mortality: An estimated 27,000 deaths in 1987, the third leading cause of cancer deaths in men.

Warning Signals: Most signs or symptoms of prostate cancer are nonspecific, and do not distinguish from benign conditions such a* infection or prostate enlargement. These include weak or interrupted flow of urine; inability to urinate or difficulty in starting urination; need to urinate frequently, especially at night; blood in the urine; urine flow that is not easily stopped; painful or burning urination; continuing pain in lower back, pelvis or upper thighs.

Risk Factors: Incidence increases with age through the most advanced ages; about 80% of all prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65. The disease is more common In northwest Europe and North America; rare in the Near East Africa, Central and South America. Black Americans have the highest rate of incidence in the world for reasons not currently known. There is some familial association, but it is unclear whether this is due to genetic or environmental association. Dietary rat may be a factor, based on studies conducted internationally. Workers who work with cadmium are found to be at slightly higher risk.

Studies of migrating populations have suggested that environmental factors, such as diet and Ufestyle, may play an important role in the risk of developing cancer of the prostate.

Early Detection: Every man over 40 should have a rectal exam as part of his regular annual physical checkup. Men over 40 should be alert to changes such as urinary difficulties, continuing pain in lower back, pelvis or upper thighs, and should see their physician immediately should any occur. The key to saving lives from prostate cancer is early detection and treatment.

Treatment: Surgery, atone or in combination with radiation and/or hormones, and anticancer drugs are all options available in the treatment of prostate cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy may be the treatment chosen to cure prostate cancer if it Is found in an early localized state. Hormone treatment and anticancer drug* also may control prostate cancer for kmg periods by shrinking the size of the tumor and greatly relieving pain.

Survival: Sixty-three percent of all prostate cancers are discovered while still localized within the general region of the prostate; 83% of all patients whose tumors are diagnosed at this stage are alive 5 years after treatment. Survival rates for all stages combined have steadily improved since 1940, and in the last 20 years have increased from 48% to 70%,

BLADDER CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 45,000 new cases of bladder cancer in 1987; 33,000 in males, 12,000 in females. Bladder cancers account for 7% of the new cancer cases diagnosed each year in men and 3% in women. Bladder cancer is the 5th most common form of cancer in males and 10th most common form of cancer in females in this country.

Mortality: An estimated 10,600 deaths in 1987 from bladder cancers, the 8th leading cause of cancer deaths in males and Mth in females.

Warning Signals: Blood in the urine. Usually associated with increased frequency of urination.

Risk Factors: Smoking is the greatest risk factor in bladder cancer, with smokers experiencing twice the risk of nonsmokers. Smoking is estimated to be responsible for about 49% of the bladder cancers among men and 10% among women. Overall the incidence

rate of bladder cancer is 4 times as great among men as women, and higher in whites than In blacks. People living in urban areas, and dye rubber and leather workers also are at higher risk Coffee and artificial sweeteners have been found to increase cancer risk in a few studies but most studies have not found *n increased risk.

Diagnosis: Diagnosis of bladder cancer is achieved by examination erf the bladder wall with a cystoscope, a slender tube fitted with a lens and light that can be inserted into the tract through the urethra.

Treatment: Surgery; alone or in combination with other treatments, is used in 92% of cases.

Survival: The 5-year survival rate for bladder cancer is 87% when detected in an early stage. For those cancers more advanced, the survival rate drops to 38%.

SKIN CANCER

Incidence: Over 500,000 cases a year, the vast majority of whkh are highly curable basal or squamous cell cancers. They are more common among individuals with lightly pigmented skin, living at latitudes near the equator. The most serious skin cancer is malignant melanoma, which strikes about 26,000 men and women each year. The incidence of melanoma is increasing at the rate of 3.4% per year.

Mortality: An estimated 7,800 deaths a year, 5300 from malignant melanoma, and 2,000 due to other skin cancers.

Warning Signals: Any unusual skin condition, especially a change tn the size or color of a mole or other darkly pigmented growth or spot. Scaliness, oozing, bleeding or the appearance of a bump or nodule, the spread of pigment beyond the border, a change in sensation, itchiness, tenderness or pain are all warning signs of melanoma.

Risk Factors: Excessive exposure to the sun: fair complexion; occupational exposure to coal tar, pitch, creosote, arsenic compounds or radium. Among blacks, because of heavy skin pigmentation, skin cancer is negligible. One study has found that severe sunburn in childhood carries with it an excessive risk of melanoma in later life.

Prevention: Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when ultraviolet rays are strongest, and use protective clothing. Use one of a number of sunscreen preparations, especially those containing such ingredient* as PABA (para*aminoberuEoic acid). They come in varying strengths, ranging from those that permit gradual tanning to those allowing practically no tanning at all Children, in particular, should be protected from traumatk sunburns.

Early Detection: Early detection is critical. Recognition of change* in or the appearance of new skin growths Is the best way to find early skin cancer. Basal and squamous cell skin cancers often take the form

of a pale, waxlike, pearly nodule, or a red scaly, sharply outlined patch. A sudden or continuous change in a mole's appearance should be checked by a physician. Melanomas often start as small mole-like growths that increase in size, change color, become ulcerated and bleed easily from a slight injury. There is a simple ABCD rule that will help individuals remember the warning signs of melanoma: A Is lor asymmetry. One half of the mote does not match the other hall B it for border irregularity. The edges are ragged, notched or blurred. C is for cok*. The pigmentation is not uniform. D is for diameter greater than 6 mflllmelcis. Any sudden or continuing increase in site should be of special concern.

Adults should practice skin self-examination once a month.

Treatment] There are four methods of treatment: surgery (need in 90% of cases), radiation therapy, electrodeakcation {tissue destruction by heatL or cryosurgery (tissue destruction by freezing) for early skin cancer.

For malignant melanoma, adequate surgical excision of the primary growth is indicated Nearby lymph nodes may be removed The mkroKop* exaction of an suspicious motet Is essential Advanced case* of melanoma are treated on an individual basis.

Survival; For basal cell and squamous ctt) cancers, cure is highly likely with early detection and treatment. Malignant melanoma can spread to other parts of the body quickly. However, when detected in its earliest stages, with proper treatment, It is highly curable.

The overall 5-year survival rate lor white patients with malignant melanoma it 80% compared with 95% for patients with other kinds of skin cancer. The 5-year survival rate lor localized malignant melanoma is 89%; however, the survival rate, once melanoma has spread is 46%.

PANCREATIC CANCER

Incidence: An estimated 26,000 new cases in the United States in 1987. Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cancer killer. The incidence rate of pancreatic cancer among US. blacks is about 1.5 times higher than for whites.

Mortality* An estimated 24300 deaths in 1987 due to pancreatic cancer. Prom 1952 to 1982, the death rates for pancreatic cancer in the United States rose 21% to 10.4 deaths per 100,000 men. During the same period, the death rates for women rose 25% to 7.0 deaths per 100,000 women.

Warning Signal*! Cancer of the pancreas is a "silent" disease, one that occurs without symptoms until it is advanced.

Risk Factors: Risk increases with age after age 30, with the highest rates of incidence occurring between ages 70 and 79. Smoking is a major risk factor; incidence is more than twice as high for smokers versus non-smokers. The dictate is 30% more common in men, and occurs about 50% more frequently in black, versus white Americans. Some studies, as yet unconfirmed, suggest an association with chronic pancreatitis, dia-

betes and cirrhosis. High-fat diets may be a risk factor; countries with higher fat consumption levels have higher pancreatic cancer rates. Coffee has been investigated as � possible risk factor, but no conclusive evidence is currently available.

Early Detection; Research has focused on ways to diagnose pancreatic cancer before it is advanced enough to cause symptoms. Ultrasound and CAT scans are being tried, but to date only a biopsy yields a certain diagnosis.

Prevention: Very little is known about what causes the disease, or how to prevent it.

Treatment: Surgery, radiation therapy and anticancer drugs are used to treat pancreatic cancer, but so far have had tittle influence on outcome. In 59% of cases, diagnosis is so late that none of these is used.

Survival: Only 4% of patients live more than 3 years after diagnosis. The 2% of patients whose cancers occur in the insulin-producing cells, and not the duct cells of the pancreas tend to live longer; about 30% of these patients live more than 3 years after diagnosis.

LEUKEMIA

Incidence: An estimated 26,400 new cases in 1987, about half of them acute leukemia, and half of them chronic leukemia. Although it is often thought of as primarily a childhood disease, leukemia strikes many more adults (24,600 cases per year compared with 2,000 in children). Acute lymphocytic leukemia accounts for about 1,700 of the cases of leukemia among children, whereas In adults the most common types are acute granulocytic (about 8,000 cases annually), and chronic lymphocytic (9,600 cases annually).

Mortalttyi An estimated 17,800 deaths in 1987.

Warning Signals: Symptoms of acute leukemia in children can appear suddenly. Garry sign* may include fatigue, paleness, weight loss, repeated infection*, easy bruising, nose bleeds or other hemorrhages. Chronic leukemia can progress slowly and with few symptoms.

Risk Factors: Leukemia, a cancer of the bloodrorming tissues, strikes both sexes and aU ages. Causes of most cases are unknown, individuals with Down's syndrome (mongolism) and certain other hereditary abnormalities have higher than normal incidence of leukemia. It has also been linked to excessive exposure to radiation and certain chemicals such as benzene.

Early Detection: Leukemia may be difficult to diag-nose early because symptoms often appear to be those of other less serious conditions. When a physician does suspect leukemia, a diagnosis can be made through blood tests and an examination of bone marrow.

Treatment: Chemotherapy is the most effective method of treating leukemia. Today, continuing research in leading US. medical centers is yielding new

and better drugs for treating leukemia patients. A variety of anticancer drugs are used, either in combinations or as single agents. To prevent persistence of hidden cells, therapy of the central nervous system has become standard treatment especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia, Under appropriate conditions, bone marrow transplantation may be useful in the treatment of certain leukemia*.

When leukemia occurs, millions of abnormal, immature white blood cells are released Into the circulatory systems, These abnormal cefis crowd out normal white cells to fight infection, platelets to control hemorrhaging and red blood cells to prevent anemia. Transfusions of blood components and antibiotics are used as supportive treatments.

Survival: The overall, average 5-year survival rate for white patients with leukemia is 33%, due partly to very poor survival of patients with some types of leukemia such as acute granulocytic The 5-year survival rate for black patients is 28%. Over the last 30 years, however, there has been a dramatic improvement in survival of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia; From a 5-year survival of 4% for white males diagnosed in the early 1960% to 27% in the early 1970s to 42% around I960; for white females diagnosed in the same time periods, from 3% to 29% to 49%. In white children, the improvement has been from 4% to $6%. Moreover, in some medical centers, optimum treatment has raised survival of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia up to 75%.

CANCER BY AGE AND RACE*

BLACK AMERICANS

A study of cancer rates over several decades shows that the cancer incidence rate for blacks is hither than for whites, and that the death rate is also higher. Over a 30-year period Mack male cancer death rates rose by 68% compared to a 7% increase in black females. Incidence rates in blacks also have increased in both males and females.

The overall cancer incidence rate for blacks went up 27%, while for whites it increased 12%. Cancer mortality has increased in both races, but the rate for blacks is greater than for whites. The rates were virtually the same 3D years ago. Since then, cancer death rates in whites have increased 10%, while black rates have increased almost 50%.

Cancer sites where blacks had significantly higher increases In incidence and mortality rates included the lung, colon-red urn, prostate and esophagus. Esopha-geaTcancer, long considered mainly a disease of males, remained about the same in whites and rose rapidly in blacks of both sexes.

The incidence of invasive cancer of the uterine cervix

dropped in both Mack and white women, although the incidence in black* is still double that in whites. However, the rate for endometrial cancer�or cancer of the body of the uterus�for white women is almost double that of Mack women.

Survival rates for patients diagnosed between 1974 and 1982 were compared for whites and blacks. More whites than blacks had cancer diagnosed in an early, localized stage when the chances of cure are best; 39% for whites versus 33% for blacks.

In a survey done for the ACS by the Gallup Organization in March 1986, the public's awareness and use of cancer tests was determined. The survey showed that 92% of white women knew of the Pap test and that 85% had had the test at some time, while only 76% of black women knew of it and 70% had had it For proctoscopic exams, 68% of the white population were aware of the procedure and 38% had had it at some time. For blacks, only 41% were aware of H and 21% had had it

THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED

A 1986 ACS Special Subcommittee report, "Cancer in the Economically Disadvantaged" found that cancer survival, and In some cases incidence, are related to socioeconomic factors such as the availability of health services. The report also found that ethnic differences in cancer are secondary to socioeconomic factors, and that there are higher rates of cancer mortality for

patients of low socioeconomic status compared to those in higher brackets. Estimates suggest that at least half of the difference* in survival rates are due to late diagnosis among economically dlaadvantaged patients, pointing up the need for more effective early detection programs and better access to treatment among this segment of the American poptdatknt

HISPANIC-AMERICANS

A recent ACS-spomored report described Hispanic attitudes toward cancer, cancer risk reduction and early detection. The study, conducted for the Society by the firm of Clark, Martire and Bartolomeo, Inc., underscored an urgent need for extensive cancer education and information programs directed to Hispanic-Americans. Survey findings showed that Hispanic-Americans are

not adequately aware of most of the warning signals of cancer or of ways to reduce cancer risk, and that they tend not to seek early detection or treatment. The study identified the key psychological cultural and economic barriers hindering the fight against cancer in the Hispanic-American community.

CHILDREN

Incidence: An estimated 6,600 new cases in 1987, making it rare as a childhood disease. Common sites include the blood and bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, brain, nervous system, kidneys and soft tissues,

Mortality: An estimated 3,200 deaths in 1987, about half of them from leukemia. Despite its rarity, cancer is the chief cause o( death by disease in children between the ages of 3 and 14. Mortality has declined

from 83 per 100,000 in 1950 to 4,1 in 1981

Early Detection: Cancers in children often are difficult to recognixe. Parents should see that their children haw regular medical checkups, and be alert to any unusual symptoms that persist They include: unusual mass or swelling; unexplained paleness and loss of energy; sudden tendency to bruise; persistent^ k*ydi�dp<unOTlimptt\g;pfolonj^unexp

or illness; frequent headaches, often with vomiting-sudden eye Dr vision changes; and excessive, rapid weight loss.

Some of the main childhood cancers aiei

Itufonte See preceding section.

Osteogenic Sarcoma and Boing's Sarcoma are bone cancers. There may be no pain at first, but swelling in the area of the tumor is often a first sign.

Neuroblastoma can appear anywhere but usually in the abdomen, where a swelling occurs.

Rhabdomyosarcoma, the most common soft tissue sarcoma, can occur in the head and neck area, genito-urinary area, trunk and extremilies.

Brain Canon in early stages may cause headaches, blurred or double vision, dizziness, difficulty in walking or handling objects, and nausea.

Lymphomax and Hodskin's Disease axe cancers that involve the lymph nodes, and also may invade bone marrow and other organs, They may cause swelling

of lymph nodes in the neck, armpit or groin. Other symptoms may include genera) weakness and possibly fever.

Retinoblastoma, or an eye cancer, usually occurs in children under the age of four. When detected early, cure is possible with appropriate treatment.

Wilms' Tumor, a kidney cancer, may be recognized by a swelling or lump in the abdomea

Treatment: Childhood cancers can be treated by a combination of therapies, coordinated by a team of experts. They include oncologic physicians, pediatric nurses, social workers, psychologists and others who assist children and their families.

Survival: Five-year survival rates vary considerably, depending on the site. Among those for white children: bone cancer, 45%; neuroblastoma, 53%; brain and cen-tral nervous system, 53%; Wilms' rumor (kidney), 82%; and Hodgkln s disease, 88%. (Data for black children is insufficient)

PREVENTION

FACTORS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER.

SMOKING                Cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases among men and 75% among

women�about 83% overall Smoking accounts for about 30% of aJJ cancer deaths. Those   * who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes a day have lung cancer mortality rates 15 to 25 times greater than nonsmokers.

SUNLIGHT              Almost all of the more than 500,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer developed each

year in the US. are considered to be sun-related. Recent epidemiological evidence shows that sun exposure is a makir factor in the'development of melanoma and that the incidence increases for those living near the equator. (See Selected Cancer Sites: Skin Cancer)

ALCOHOL               Oral cancer and cancers of the larynx, throat, esophagus, and liver occur more frequently

among heavy drinkers of alcohol (See Selected Cancer Sites: Oral Cancer)

SMOKELESS            Increased risk factor for cancers of the mouth, larynx, throat, and esophagus. Highly habit

TOBACCO               forming. (See Selected Cancer Sites: Lung Cancer and Oral Cancer)

ESTROGEN              For mature women, certain risks associated with estrogen treatment to control menopausal

symptoms, including an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Use of estrogen bv menopausal women needs careful discussion by the woman and her physician. (See Selected Cancer Sites: Uterine Cancer)

RADIATION             Excessive exposure to radiation can increase cancer risk. Most medkal X rays are adjusted

to deliver the lowest dose possible without sacrificing image quality.

OCCUPATIONAL    Exposure to a number of industrial agents (nickel chromate, asbestos, vinyl chloride, etc.) HAZARDS               increases risk. Risk factor greatly increased when combined with smoking.

NUTRITION             Risk for colon, breast and uterine cancers increases for obese people. High-fat diet may

be a factor in the development of certain cancers such as breast colon and prostate. High-fiber foods may help reduce risk of colon cancer, and can be a wholesome substitute for high-fat diets. Foods rich in vitamins A and C may help lower risk for cancers of larynx, esophagus, stomach and lung. Eating cruciferous vegetables may help protect against certain cancers. Salt-cured, smoked and nitrite-cured foods have been linked to esophageal and stomach cancer. The heavy use of alcohol especially when accompanied by cigarette smoking or chewing tobacco, increases risk of cancers of the mouth, larynx, throat, esophagus, and liver. (See above)

SECONDARY PREVENTION REFERS TO STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO DIAGNOSE A CANCER OR PRECURSOR AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER IT HAS DEVELOPED.

COLORECTAL        The ACS recommends three tests for the early detection of colon and rectum cancer in TESTS                      people without symptom*. The digital rectal examination, performed by a physician during

mi office visit, should be performed every year after the age of 40; the stool blood test is recommended every year after 50; and the proctosigmoidoscopy examination should be carried out every 3 to 5 years after the age of 50 following two annual exams with negative results. (See Selected Cancer Sites: Colon and Rectum Cancel)

PAP TEST                 For the average risk person, a Pap test is recommended annually until two consecutive

satisfactory tests are negative, and then once every three years. The Pap test is highly effective in detecting cancer of the uterine cervix, but is less effective in detecting endometrial cancer.          ^

Prevention

CANCER-RELATED CHECKUP GUIDELINES

Guidelines for the early detection of cancer in people without symptom* are recommended by the American Cancer Society as follows:

A amcer-rttam checkup

* every 3 years for those 20-40 years of age,

* every year for those 40 and over.

The Society advises (he public to talk with their doctors and ask how the guidelines relate to them. The checkup should always include health counseling (such as tips on quitting smoking) and examinations for cancer of the thyroid, testes, prostate, mouth, ovaries, skin and lymph nodes.

In particular: � Ages 20-40� For breast cancer, an examination by a physkian every three years, a self-exam every month, and one baseline breast X ray between the ages of 35 and 39. For uterine cancer, a pelvic exam every three years and a Pap test at least every three years after

two initial negative tests one year apart (including women under 20 if sexually active). * Ages 40 and over�For breast cancer, a professional exam every year, a self-exam every month and a breast X ray every 1-2 years for those 4049; every year for those 50 and over. For uterine cancer, a pelvk exam every year, a Pap test at least every three years (after two negative tests a year apart), and an endometrial tissue sample at menopause, if at risk. For colon and rectum cancer, a digital rectal exam every year after 40, and a stool Mood test every year after 50 as well as a procto exam every 3-5 years after two initial negative testa one year apart.

Some people are at higher risk for certain cancers and may need to have tests more frequently. See individual cancer sites sections (pp. 9-14) for high risk factors.

COLORECTAL CANCER: EARLY DETECTION IS THE KEY

When cancer of the colon and rectum is found and treated in an early, localized stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90% for*cojon cancer and 80% for rectal cancer. However, survival figures drop to 51% and 38%, respectively, after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Because colorectal cancer develops over a period of time, detection of the disease is possible long before symptoms appear. Early detection of small cancers and polyps reduces the likelihood of major surgery and the need for a colostomy�an abdominal opening created for the elimination of wastes. In tact permanent colostomies are rare in cases of colon cancer, and are necessary in only 15% of rectal cancer cases.

Colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer in terms of Incidence. Currently, about 145,000 new cases develop each year; about 60,000 people die from the disease annually. The incidence of colorectal cancer tends to increase with age, starting at 40 years. More than 94% of all cases occur after the age of 50. Colorectal cancer occurs about equally in both sexes. Anyone with a personal or family history of colorectal cancer, polyps in the cokm or inflammatory bowel disease, is at particularly high risk for the disease and should be examined carefully.

Evidence suggests that bowel cancer may be linked to the diet. A diet high In fat and/or low In fiber content may be a causative odor.

Projected 5-year survival rates for colorectal cancer show that early detection saves lives. Currently, the 5*ye*r survival rate is estimated at 55%, With the use of early detection techniques, such as the digital rectal exam, the stool blood test and sigmoidoscopy, and with appropriate management, the survival rate for patients with colorectal cancer could be increased from 55% to 85%. This means that over a period of time, 100,000 lives, versus the current 601000, could be saved each

It is recxwunertded that the following procedures, all part of a cancer-related checkup, be performed at designated intervals:

* A digital rectal examination every year after age 40.

* A stool blood test every year after age 50.

* A procto every three to five years after the age of 50, following two annual examinations with negative

These guidelines apply only to people without symptoms. Persona with rectal bleeding, cramping abdominal pain, or a change In bowel habits should see their physicians immediately.

A 1986 study of men and women age 40 and over, conducted for the Society by the Gallup Organization, revealed a number of Important findings concerning Americans' attitudes toward detection measures for colorectal cancer. There hat been some increase in public awareness of the 3 tests recommended to detect the disease, but there is modi room for improvement. The study found, for instance, that the percentage of Americans who ever had a digital rectal exettunaHon increased slightly since 1963, from 51% to 54%. likewise, thepercenUg^o(Ameikan�whoeverhada�toolbkK>d test rose, from 28% In 1983 to 39% in 1986. And while the percentage of men and women 50 and over who ever had a proctoscopic examination rote from 31% in 1963 to 40% In lfcfe 60% of Americana who should have the examination (according to the ACS guidelines) have not had It.

The survey also showed that 24% of those individuals In the 40-prua age group have ever asked their doctor to examine their colon or rectum. And of this group, more than half did to only because something was bothering them.

On tine promising side/ the survey showed that almost 50% of all Americans would be Interested in learning more about tfttt form of cancer.

BREAST CANCER: A PROGRAM OF ACTION

About one out of every 10 women in the United States will develop breast cancer during her lifetime. And until the disease can be prevented, the best way women can protect themselves Is through early detection and prompt treatment. Today, with modern technologies, breast cancer can be detected at very early stages of development when the chance of cure is highest.

The risk of breast cancer increases as a woman grows older, and genetic and lifestyle variances�a history of breast cancer in a close family relative, giving first birth after age 30, never giving birth, a high-fat diet and obesity (body weight 40% above normal)�may increase risk further.

The American Cancer Society recommends that women develop a three-part, personal plan of action, in cooperation with their doctors for early detection of breast cancer. (See page 19 for Checkup Guidelines.)

A clinical breast exam should be performed by a

doctor as part of a regular health checkup. This includes a visual inspection of the breasts, looking for changes in shape or size or skin dimpling, followed by a thorough inspection of the breast chest and armpits. Women should ask their doctors how often they should have a cttnkal breast exam.

A mammogram is a low-dose breast X ray that can identify cancers too small to be felt Follow the ACS guidelines for recommended frequency, depending on age and health history. Recent Improvements have reduced the amount of radiation necessary for high-quality mammograms.

The Society recommends that all women over the age of 20 perform breast aetf-examinatkma once a month. BSE is important because breast cancer symptoms may develop and be found between clinical breast exams or mammography. Through regular self-examination women become familiar with their breasts, making any changes more likely to be noticed.

TOBACCO USE

The American Cancer Society estimates that cigarette smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases among men and 75% among women�about 83% overalL

The cancer death rate for male cigarette smokers is more than double that of nonsmokers, and the rate for female smokers is 67% higher than for nonsmokers.

The higher cancer rates for men reflect the feet that in the past, more men than women smoked, and smoked more heavily. In recent years, however, the gap between male and female smoking has been narrowing.

Smoking also has been implicated in cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, pancreas and bladder. Smoking accounts for about 30% of all cancer deaths, is a major cause of heart disease, and is linked to conditions ranging from colds and gastric ulcers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

Smoking is related to 320,000 deaths each year. A September 1985 study by � the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment estimates the cost of smoking to the economy from 38 button to 96 billion, with a middle estimate of 65 billion. This amounts to $117 in lost productivity and the treatment of smoking-related diseases for each pack of cigarettes sold.

A Decline in Smoking

A September 1986 tobacco report of the VS. Department of Agriculture estimates cigarette output in 1986 at 659 bflUon, down 1.0% from last year, about the same decrease as the previous year.

From 1976 to 1985, adult male smokers (20 years and older) dropped from 42% of the population to 32%, while women smokers decreased from 32% to 28%, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Overall, the percentage of adult smokers in the

population had dropped to 30%. Other recent polk also indicate that the proportion of smokers may have dropped to 30%.

Per capita cigarette consumption among adults has fallen�from 4,141 in 1974 to 3,275 in 1986�reflecting a growing number nt ex-smokers. This is the lowest per capita consumption since 1944, From 1965 to 1983, the proportion of adult male ex-smokers (20 years and older) in the total US. population increased from 205% to 30.3%, while female ex-smokers rose from 8,2% to 15.9%.

A survey supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicated that the percentage of high school seniors (aged 17 and 18) who smoked cigarettes daily decreased from 28,8% In 1976 to 195% in 1985.

It is now estimated�from past national surveys and data from the Cancer Prevention Study H�that there are about 40 million ex-cigarette smokers in the U.S. today.

At the same time, however, the average smoker appears to be smoking more heavily. The US, Office on Smoking and Health reports that the proportion of adult male smokers (20 years and older) consuming 25 or more cigarettes per day increased from 30.7% to 32% between 1976 and 1985, and female smokers from 19.0% to 21%.

Figures from the U5. Department of Agriculture show that a total of 584 bflfion cigarettes were con* sumed in 1986, down from 594 in 1985.

Risk Awareness

A Federal Trade Commission star! report states that although most Americana are aware of a health rok in smoking, more than 40% don't know smoking causes most lung cancer, and 20% don't know It can cause cancer at all More than 30% are unaware that smoking

doubles a person's risk of heart attack, and 50% of women do not know that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth and miscarriage*

tower Tar it Nicotine

Research has shown that there is no such thing as a "safe" cigarette, hut {hat those who are not yet able to quit would be well advised to switch to brands with the lowest possible tar and nicotine (T/N> content. Moreover, low T/N smokers find it easier to quit altogether than high T/N smokers.

In an ACS study conducted from I960 to 1972, the average mortality of low T/N smokers was 16% lower than that of high T/N smokers, and the comparable figure for lung cancer mortality was 26%,

It is important to remember that besides tar and nicotine,, cigarette smoke contains a host of other poisonous gases such as hydrogen cyanide, volatile aromatic hydrocarbons, and especially carbon monoxide�possibly � critical factor in coronary heart disease and fetal growth retardation, among other things. While some hazards are reduced slightly by cigarette fitters, certain filtered brands have been found to actually deliver more carbon monoxide than those without fitters.

involuntary Smoking Hazards

There are hazards for nonsmokers who breathe the smoke of others' cigarettes. Several scientific studies, including a recent study by the American Cancer Society, have found an increased risk of lung cancer among nonsmoking wives of cigarette smokers. Although some studies have not shown an effect, evidence continues to grow indicating that involuntary smoking is a hazard.

Two major reviews in 1986 by the Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences state that involuntary smoking is a health hazard. Another NAS

Xrt, also in 1986, states that the amount of smoke led on airplane trips constitutes a hazard, particularly to airline personnel, and recommended that cigarette smoking on airlines be banned.

The Society's Cancer Prevention Study 0, involving more than one million Americans, will include a careful assessment of cancer risk and other diseases among smokers and involuntary smokers.

Smokeless Tobacco

There has been a recent resurgence in the use of all forms of smokeless tobacco�plug, leaf and snuff-but the greatest cause for concern centers on the increased use of "dipping snuff." In this practice, tobacco that has been processed tnto a coarse, moist powder is placed between the cheek and gum, and nicotine, along with a number of other carcinogens, are absorbed through the oral tissue. "Dipping snuff" is a highly addictive habit, one that exposes the body to levels of nicotine similar to those of cigarettes. A 1986 report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General, outlining the health consequences of smokeless tobacco use, concluded that there fa strong scientific evidence that the use of snuff causes cancer in humans, particularly cancer of the oral cavity Oral cancer occurs several times more frequently among snuff dippers compared to non-tobacco users, and the excess risk of cancer of the cheek and gum may reach nearly 50-fald among long-term snuff users. Smokeless tobacco Is becoming! problem Urge it^copr, the report found that in 1985 Smokeless tobacco was used by at least 12 million people in the United States, and half of these were regular users, The use of smokeless tobaccos is increasing among male adolescents and young male adults.

Industrial Hazards

Industrial workers are especially susceptible to lung diseases due to the combined effects of cigarette smoking and exposure to toxic industrial substances such as fumes rrowt rubber, chlorine and dust from cotton and cost Exposure to asbestos in combination with cigarette smoking increases an individual's cancer risk nearly 60 times.

NUTRITION AND CANCER: A COMMON SENSE APPROACH

Extensive research is under way to evaluate and clarify the role diet and nutrition play in the development of cancer. At this point, no direct cause-arid* effect relationship has been proved, though statistics show that some foods may increase or decrease the risks for certain types of cancer. Evidence indicates that people might reduce their cancer risk by observing the following recommendations:

1. Avoid obesity.

Individuals 40% or more overweight increase their risk of colon, breast, prostate, gallbladder, ovary, and uterine cancers. People with weight problems should consult their physicians to determine their best body weight, since their medical condition and body build must be taken into account. Physicians can recommend

a suitable diet and exercise regimen to help maintain an appropriate weight.

2. Cut down on total fal intake.

A diet high in fat may be a factor in the development of certain cancers, particularly breast, colon and prostate In addition, by avoiding fatty foods, people are better able to control body weight

3. Eat more high-fiber foods such as whole grain cereals, fruits and vegetables.

Regular consumption of cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended. Studies suggest that diets high in fiber may help to reduce the risk ofcolon cancer. Furthermore, foods high In fiber content art a wholesome substitute for foods high in fat.

4* Include foods rich fan vitamins A and C in your dairy diet

People should include in their diet dark green and deep yellow fresh vegetables and fruits, such as carrots, spinach, sweet potatoes, peaches, and apricots as sources of vitamin A; and oranges, grapefruit, strawberries, green and red peppers for vitamin C. These foods may help lower risk for cancers of the larynx, esophagus and the lung. The excess use of vitamin A supplements is not recommended because of possible toxicity,

5. Indudfj cruciferous vegetables in your diet.

Certain vegetables In the cruciferous family�cab-bage, broccoli brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and cauliflower�may help prevent certain cancers from developing. Research is in progress to determine how these foods may protect against cancer. Cruciferous

vegetables have flowers with four leaves in the pattern of across.

6. Eat moderately of sail-cured, smoked and nitrite-cured foods.

In areas of the world where salt-cured and smoked foods are eaten frequently, there is more incidence of cancer of the esophagus and stomach. The American food industry has developed new processes to avoid possible cancer-causing by-products,

7. Keep alcohol consumption moderate, if you do drink.

The heavy use of alcohol, especially when accompanied by cigarette smoking or smokeless tobacco, increases risk of cancers of the mouth, larynx, throat, esophagus and liver.

THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY

PROFILE

The American Cancer Society, Inc. b a national voluntary health organization of 25 million Americans united to conquer cancer through balanced programs of research, education, patient service and rehabilitation.

Organization: The American Cancer Society, Inc. is composed of a National Society, with 58 chartered Divisions and 3,232 Units.

The National Society: A 200-member House of Delegates provides a basic representation from the 58 Divisions and additional representation on the basis of population. It elects and is governed by a Board of Directors of 124 voting members, approximately half of whom are members of the medical or scientific professions.

The National Society is responsible for overall planning and coordination, arid provides technical help and materials to Divisions and Units. The National Society

administers programs of research, medical grants and clinkal fellowships, and is charged with carrying out public and professional education on the national leveL

The 58 Divisions: These are governed by members of Divisional Boards of Directors, both medical and lay, in all the states plus six metropolitan areas, the District of Columbia and Puerto Kka

The Units; These are organized to cover the counties in the United States. There are thousands of community leaders who direct the Society's programs at this level The basic strength of the Society lies in the loyal ranks of volunteers fighting cancer in their communities.

The Programs: The Society maintains Hs priorities and goals through activities developed by the departments of Research, Professional Education, Public Education, Public Information, Epidemiology and Statistics, Service and Rehabilitation, and Crusade.

PUBLIC EDUCATION

The American Cancer Society has a strong and long* standing commitment to educating the public about ways of preventing or reducing the risk of developing cancer. Because each year thousands of lives could be saved through cancer prevention, risk reduction and early detection practices, the Society's Public Ed-ucation programs are designed to inform people about cancer, tell them what they can do to protect themselves, and demonstrate related health habits and lifestyles.

The Society places its major educational focus in two areas: !) primary cancer prevention which includes smoking control and the relationship between diet

nutrition and cancer; and 2) the Importance and value of periodic, cancer-related checkups and specific cancer tests. Prompt action in the event that one of ameer's seven warning signals occurs, is also encouraged.

Six cancer sites offer the greatest opportunity for the prevention or cure of cancer: colon and rectum, lung, breast, uterus, oral cavity and skin. These sites account for the majority of cancer cases and about half of all cancer deaths, the Society's Public Education planning strategy places emphasis on the first four of these six sites where prevention, risk reduction and early detection practices realize the greatest return in terms of lives saved.

Educating the Young and Old

ACS Public Education programs are divided into two major audience categories: adults and youth. Adults are reached through the workplace clubs and organizations, at home and in neighborhoods, and through programs with other health agencies. Programa tor adults are carried out in small group settings or on a one-to-one basis, Involving two-way communication and interaction. Whenever possible, volunteers are selected on the basis of skills that can be readily adapted to Society work such as ex-smokers with group experience who can help in smoking cessation programs, and nurses who can teach breast self-examination to groups of women. The Society reinforces its Public Education messages with a variety of films, filmstrips, pamphlets and posters.

Youth programs are organized according to age-level to reach children and youth on the preschool, elementary, Intermediary and secondary levels. The program for youth is a scientific, comprehensive cancer education program with promise of significant impact on cancer risk Educational strategies are designed to teach young people good health habits, help them to make health-enhancing lifestyle decisions and understand health behavior as it relates to cancer risk reduction. Materials are available as coordinated components or program packages and are implemented through existing school curricula or as a basic introduction to health. Youth programs are usually conducted in the nation's schools and often include activities to be used in the home and community.

Reaching More People

In 19&5-86, American Cancer Society Public Education programs, carried out at local levels, tench�4 19.5 million adults and 30.5 million young people for a total of SO million.

In the decade of the 1980s, the Society, as its goals, hopes to encourage more Americans to have tests for colorectal cancer, reduce the number of smokers, and increase the number of women who have breast cancer detection tests and who practice monthly breast self-examination, get Pap tests and have endometrial tissue samples taken. To help achieve its education objectives and priorities, the Society has launched a number of new programs including Taking Control" a 10-step guide to a healthy life of reduced cancer risk a "Smoke-Free Young America by the Year 2000" initiative; and a new educational emphasis on breast cancer detection awareness.

In addition to the Society's intensive, person-to-person educational outreach, broader ACS programs blanket the nation with Uresaving messages. During the Society'! annual door-to-door fund-raising Crusade, volunteers make persona) home visits, informing individuals on how to protect themselves against cancer.

Overall the Society distributes more than 60 tafllkm educational leaflets each year, and important cancer educational messages reach nearly every US. household through television, radio and the print media.

PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION

ACS Professional Education programs on cancer prevention and detection bring the latest developments in cancer health professkmals, especially primary care physicians, nurses, and other groups.

Professional Education's National conferences, clinical fellowships, materials), professorships and scholarships provide ^formation and training in the prevention and eajjh/ detection of cancer, and in the treatment and rehabilitation of cancer patients. Its involvement in sitch programa as Breast Cancer Detection Awareness, Colorectal Health Check and Smoke-Free Young America are part of the overall ACS Professional Education effort

AtidioviwaMotaTtaJs

Videotapes, films, slide seta, audiotapes, publications and exhibits are also available for Professional Education programs m hospitals as well as in medical, dental and nursing schools, and are used by professional societies at local and national meetings. The videocassettes and slide acts are distributed through ACS Divisions and Units on a free loan, five-year lease or direct sale basis.

The ACS publishes Cm-A Cancer Journal for Clinicum*, which is directed particularly to the primary care phys-



ician and has a total circulation of more than 470,000, The Society supports the publication of Gsscrr, directed to those specializing in the care of the cancer patient

Nursing Programs

Cancer Nuning News is sent to about 90,000 muses. It keeps nurses up-to-date on cancer, oncology nursing, the American Cancer Society, and opportunities in continuing education. The newsletter is sent free to any nurse; requests for subscriptions should be sent to the Executive Editor, Owrr Nuniag New*, do American Cancer Society, 4 West 35th St, New York NY 10001

Twenty one-year nursing scholarships are awarded each year to qualified graduate students studying lor a master's degree with a specialty In cancer nursing. The recipients may apply for a second years funding. A training program to prepare nurses lor Ph.D.'a in related fields was initiated with the funding of the first three candidates in 1966.

Another recently launched program, "CHnkal Pro* kssctfships m Oncology Nursing, provides a means forACSDIvisk>nstosttPpc^8elt<te4irwirviduaUwho will develop high quality cancer teaching programs within schools of nurring.

Clinical Oncology Awards

Since 1948, the ACS National Clinical Fellowship program has spent more than $40 million to train some 7,400 physicians and dentists in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Training has been provided on two levels at centers and hospitals with qualified training program*.

The Regular Clinical Fellowship program�for hospital residents�is designed to improve the management of the patient with cancer by supporting clinical oncology training for young physicians and dentists.

The Sodety awards Clinical Oncology Career Development Awards to some outstanding individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to pursue an academic career in oncology.

During 1986-87, training will be supported for 311 Regular Clinical Fellows and 34 new Career Develop* ment Awards.

The Clinical Fellowship program has been extremely successful in achieving its goal of increasing the num-

ber of highly qualified oncologists providing cancer care, in the future, the emphasis of the program wQl be on developing academic oncologists who will acquire both clinical Oncology expertise and the ability to perform independent cjuvteal oncology research.

Unproven Methods of Cancer Management

The American Cancer Society maintains information on unproven methods of cancer management. This information is reviewed in-depth and is issued in position statements. These statements are available on request to physicians, science writers, editors and the general public, to assist in evaluating claims made for unproven methods of cancer prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment.

The Society welcomes new developments which have been proven scientifically effective and safe in the prevention, detection, diagnosis or treatment of cancer.

SERVICE AND REHABILITATION

In 1984 over one half million cancer patients were reached through the innovative service and rehabilitation programs of the American Cancer Society. Because of the many volunteers at the Division and Unit levels, the Society is able to offer a wide range of services encompassing:

1.  Information and guidance services which provide specific information about cancer as well as referral to Society services and other resources in the community to meet the social psychological and home care needs of cancer patients and their families;

2.  Home care items for use by patients;

3.  Transportation of cancer patients, assisting them in getting to and from medkal and therapy appointments;

4.  Rehabilitation programs helping patients return to their families, communities and occupations through carefully trained and selected visitor and group programs; and

5.  Patient/family education programs to provide a better understanding of the disease and its management through group education programs, pamphlets, booklets and audiovisual presentations.

Programs

CanSurmouni is a short-term visitor program for patients, and the families of patients, with many types of cancer. Hospital and home visits are made with the approval and awareness of the physician. The one-to-one visit by a person who has experienced the same type of cancer offers functional emotional and social support.

Reach to fteotxry is the largest of the Society's patient visitor programs. It addresses the many needs of women who have/have had breast cancer. Carefully selected and trained volunteer visitors provide support and information, with the approval of the attending physician. The program is designed to help women

meet the physical emotional and cosmetic needs related to their disease and tor its treatment In addition, literature and services to help husbands, children and friends of breast cancer patients are available.

Laryngectomy Rehabilitation Promm, spearheaded by The International Association of Laryngectomees (1AL), brings the message that a laryngectomee can return to a normal life. Coordinated through more than 325 dubs, laryngectomee visitors provide pre and/or postoperative support to patients who have recently undergone the laryngectomy operation.

Ostomy R/habilitatm Program�Somt patients with intestinal or urinary cancers must have abdominal ostomies (surgically constructed openings for eUmina-tion of bodily wastes). Trained volunteers who have experienced this same type of surgery offer help on a one-to-one basis. Cooperating with the United Ostomy Association and enterostomal therapists, patients are assisted in their physical and psychological adjustment.

Home Care Items�A program providing necessary, useful home care supplies, equipment, dressings and gifts for the comfort and recreation of the patient.

Transportation�Through the efforts of volunteer drivers in programs such as Road to Recovery, cancer patients receive transportation for diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and continuing care.

Patient and Family Education

The Society sponsors group and individual education programs, distributes pamphlets and booklets for an individual's use, and provides audiovisual presentations for patients of all ages and their families to help them understand, and deal with the complexities of the disease. Group programs such as I CAN COPE provide information on cancer therapy, treatment, side effects, nutrition, resource availability and other topics of interest to cancer patients and their families.

COSTS OF CANCER

A study by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) puts overall medical cost* for cancer at S715 billion for W85f $2U billion tor direct costs; $8.6 billion for so-called morbidity costs {cost of lost productivity), and Ml.2 billion for mortality cost*. The figures show that cancer accounts for 10% of the total cost of disease in the US. and that its share of the total cost of premature death is about 16% of all causes of death.

Individuals have several sources of help in paying for cancer costs; third-party payers such as Blue Cross

and private insurance companies, public agencies and private health organizations. Cancer is covered by personal insurance plans either under narrowly defined cancer policies or through catastrophic illness provisions in comprehensive insurance programs.

The Third National Cancer Survey showed that for patients under 65 years, Blue Cross andprivate insurers were the source of payment in over 77% of the cases. For patients over 65, Medicare paid expenses in nearly SS% of the cases.

THE ACS AND RESEARCH

The American Cancer Society is the largest source of private cancer research funds in the United States* second only to the National Cancer Institute, an agency of the Federal government.

The Society^ overall investment in research each year has grown steadily from $1 million in 1946 to about S80 million* today. This sum represents nearly a third of the total ACS budcet. To date, the Society has invested close to SI billion in cancer research.

The research program focuses primarily on inves-tigator�inHiated projects, rather than directed research undertaken on a contract basis. With the exception of staff and facilities to carry out its epidemiological studies, the ACS neither hires staff researchers nor operates its own laboratories. This gives the Society the freedom to place Us grants where the most innovative and promising ideas are being explored.

A key factor in the role of the Society in cancer research is providing qualified scientists with alternative funding sources to carry out their work. The Society believes U can make the most effective use of its research funds by supporting investigators working in established medical and other scientific institutions across the country. In this way there is t minimum of overhead am) a maximum of flexibility to make sure that research money has the highest probability of yielding results that will benefit people.

Applications for ACS grants are put through a rigorous process of evaluation, beginning with careful study by the appropriate one of It scientific review committees and then by two additional groups of experts. They must be given final approval by the National Board of Directors.

Kinds of Grants

The Society's research program is diverse in concept and recipients. It provides support both for established scientists and those starting out on their own independent research. It funds postdoctoral training for promising young investigators and stimulates new Ideas in cancer research among those working in universities, institutes arid teaching hospitals.

OveraU, the program offers five types of grants: (1) Research and Clinical Investigation Grants to finance investigator-initiated research; (2) Institutional Research Grants to universities. Institutes and hospitals to support pilot studies and the work of young Investigators in cancer; (3) Research Personnel Grants to outstanding scientists and fellows specializing or

Development Program Grants to provide rapid funding for priority projects; and (5) Special Institutional Grants for Cancer Cause and Prevention Research to provide

longer term funding for interdisciplinary projects for which support i* not readily available through the Society's other programs.

Research Professorships. The Research Professorship program, unique in the field, has been in existence

�Subject to madti                                                                                 26

since 1957. The Society supports 25 of the nation's most gifted scientists for long periods of time, until their retirement. These are people devoting their lives' work to cancer research. Freed of major administrative responsibilities and other restrictions, they can concentrate on their fields of scientific investigation.

Clinical Research Professorships. This novel and unique program is a new initiative of the Society to provide support for clinicians and scientists who are able to facilitate advances in clinical cancet research by bridging the gap between bask science and clinical medicine.

Physicians' Research Training Fellowships. Unique in the research world, this type of Research Personnel Grant was inaugurated in 1981 because of a dearth of MD*s in the research field. It provides an opportunity for physicians to take three years from their medical ctrcm to fafa gg re^juxhers.

Research Development Program. Established to identify and provide rapid funding for high priority projects, approved applications can be funded in less than three month*. This compares with the 10 to 18 months required by the Federal government before a new application can be funded

The kinds of research projects eligible under the Research Development Program include: (1) unique research opportunities which cannot wait for the normal lengthy funding procedures; (2) unanticipated needs relating to research already under way; (3) program coordination, especially that Involving clinical trials and the dissemination of research results to community hospitals; and (4) program integration between the American Cancer Society and other health organisations.

All applications are evaluated for merit, qualifications and productivity of the investigator, relevance!, need for rapid funding, and probability of the project's eventual contribution to cancer control More than $12 million has been appropriated so far to the Research Development Program, over half of which has been for interferon research.

Interferon Research. Interferons, a group of natural body proteins, were discovered as antiviral agents, and later found have some anticancer activity. In 1978, the Society invested an unprecedented $2 million to purchase interferon for clinical trials. At the time, interferons were extremely scarce and expensive, since they were obtained from human blood cells.

Interferons work dramatically to improve certain diseases such as hairy cell leukemia and some lymphomas and papillomas. In these the frequency of improvement approaches 90%. In other diseases, such as kidney cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma, there are dramatic responses, but they are far teas frequent � on the order of 10-30%; fan lung and colon cancer, interferon rarely causes improvement The thrust of current research with interferons is to attempt to improve their effectiveness by combining them with more conventional chemotherapeuric drugs and by

using mixtures of different interferons.

Large quantities of certain types of interferon can be produced now using the techniques of recombinant DNA. They are far cheaper and purer than the original human blood substances, and have recently been approved for marketing. The new technology is also extremely valuable tor producing complex drugs and chemicals to benefit mankind. Furthermore, other substances, called biologic response modifiers/ which use immune means to combat cancer are being developed at a rapid pace, including interleukuv2/ lymphokine activated killer cell (1L-2/LAK) reagents which appear to shrink such cancers as kidney and melanoma. Some of these reagents are very potent and quite toxic, and the search Is on to find effective and safer ways to use them in patients.

Research in the 80's

In addition to ongoing interferon studies, ACS-furtded researchers will continue to investigate broad areas of cancer research in the coming decade. For example, they will be exploring:

Genetic engineering. One method in this new technology, recombinant DNA, is already being used to produce interferon. It has among its potential uses the manufacture of powerful new drugs, correcting impaired immune systems, even modifying heredity by transplanting foreign genes. It is hoped that the process will yield other anticancer activities. Some that appear quite promising at the moment are tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-2, and certain bone marrow growth regulators.

Monoclonal antibodies. Tailor-made, highly specific monoclonal antibodies can be produced that will preferentially recognize cancer cells, and thus be able to detect cancer early, when the disease is most curable, before clinical signs appear. Monoclonal antibodies already have been used to deliver drugs directly to tumors, killing them but sparing healthy tissue.

Mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Investigators are approaching these key questions from many angles. One model, as found in animals, shows that cancer in humans develops in a two-step process � initiation and promotion. Other questions include Are there protO'Oncogenes, normal genes serving as master switches for early tfesue development, which induce normal cells to become cancerous later in life? If so, what turns them on? Can they be programmed to Hay off? Do viruses, already known to cause cancer in animals, also cause cancer in humans, perhaps by activation of these prtto-oncogenes? Conversely, a normal gene that appears to suppress cancer development has been isolated recently. Does this Rene produce a substance that stops normal cells from dividing before they become cancerous?

ChemoprererUkm. There Is strong evidence that people can perhaps be protected from cancer by what they eat or drink; or by other substances or lifestyles that serve m defense mechanisms. Clues are being pursued by ACS researchers studying such agents as vitamin A; retinoids (synthetic forms of vitamin A* vitamin C; vitamin Hi the chemical element selenium, found In the soil; and other naturally occurring

substances in brussels sprouts, cabbage, and certain other foodstuffs. This Is a new and important area which needs further research so that recommendations can be developed on how people should change their lifestyles to reduce their chances of getting cancer.

Still other AGS investigators are looking for ways to detect cancer earlier by tracing a cell's biochemical markers, They are exploring evidence that the outbreak of the rare skin cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, is linked to a breakdown in the individual's immune system. And they are testing the hypothesis that certain chemicals enhance a tumor's responsiveness to radiation therapy.

The Financial Research Picture

In fiscal 1966, the ACS made 775 grants to major institutions in this country and to scientists working here and abroad The total amount, subject to audit, was nearly $74 million. This does not include some $15 million granted directly by ACS Divisions. The following table�covering the years 1983-1966 inclusive�lists the number of applications received, the total number of dollars reouired. and those actually funded by the ACS National Office.*

Special Institutional Grants

As part of its continuing program to provide substantial and relatively long-term support for major institutions engaged ki cancer cause and prevention research, the American Cancer Society awarded 2 new and renewed 2 Special Institutional Grants in fiscal year 1981 totalling $4 muHon. Twelve Special Institutional Grants are currently in effect at the following institutions:

� Institute of Environmental Medicine, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, to conduct a broad spectrum of studies dealing with such subjects as DNA interactions, risk assessment and nutrition.

� Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, to use Innovative techniques to detect changes in DNA, hemoglobin and albumin, and changes in T-cells that could signal relatively low exposures to carcinogens; together with the Harvard School of Public Health for biochemk^stuxiies of cancer risks, involving such groups as smokers, nonsmokers and those with patrjcular dietary habits.

� Milton Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania state ItoJveraity, Hershey, PA, to research the cause, course and prevention of metastatic turner growth.

CANCER AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Most cancer cases in the United States are believed to be environmentally related, that is, associated in some way with our physical surroundings, personal habits or lifestyles.

Occupational hazards, although associated with only a small percentage of cancers, are under close surveil-lance. Virtually every suspected major chemical and other substance in the workplace presumed to be a health risk is under investigation. Each study can require yt�n and hundreds of thousands of dollars to complete.

Some environmental causes of cancer are well known. About 30% of all cancers are directly related to the use of tobacco, either alone or in conjunction with excessive consumption of alcohol.

Other causes are harder to determine. Diet is suspected as an important element in cancer risk, some say as much as 35% of all cancer deaths. There is much research underway on the role diet and nutrition play in the development of cancer.

To help identify environmental factors in human cancer, the American Cancer Society has undertaken a three-part program of environmental cancer research. This involves (1) Cancer Prevention Study It an epidemiologic study to examine the relationship of en* vironment and lifestyle ito cancer development; (2) studies of groups exposed to industrial substances suspected oi causing cancer; and (3) support of extramural cancer cause and prevention research projects.

The American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Stuffy II

One of the largest research studies ever carried out in the United States was launched in 198Z Cancer Prevention Study H a long-term prospective study, is examining the habits and exposures of mote than one million Americans to leant how lifestyles and environ* mental factors affect the development of cancer.

Modeled after the first ACS Cancer Prevention Study (1959-72), CPS*n is similar in method but wider in scope and involves mote participants.

Over 77,000 volunteers enrolled 1.2 million men and women in the study. These volunteer researchers distributed a four-page confidential Questionnaire to participants who were asked about their exposures to certain environmental conditions, their history of disease and then* lifestyles. The questionnaires were designed to elicit more than 500 pieces of Information each, which were computerized for statistical analysts.

Many of the questions focus on health issues of current concern. These include risks of certain drugs, foods and various occupational exposures; low-tar and nicotine cigarettes; consumer products; long-term exposure to low-level radiation; and the health effects associated with air and water pollution.

For a period of six years, and possibly longer, the volunteers wiS keep track of the status and whereabouts of study participants. Various suspected relationships will be tested by comparing mortality rates of differently exposed groups.

The goal of the study is to identify those factors that increase a person's chances of developing cancer, those that carry little or no risk, and those that actually may help prevent cancer.

So far, three papers have been published from the analyses of data on the original questionnaires. One showed massive changes in American smoking habits compared to 23 years earlier in CPS I. Among men* 24% smoked, half as many as in the earlier study. More than twice as many had quit cigarette smoking. Among women, the percent who had ever smoked rose 10%, but the percent of ex-smokers quadrupled. More than one-third of male smokers and one-half of female smokers smoked brands with less than 12 mg. of tar. Another paper from CPS D showed that smoking In physicians is now down to 16%, about 14% in dentists and 23% in nurses. A third paper showed that a greater percentage of women who used artificial sweeteners gained weight over a one-year period than nonusers.

Since the first study, new factors in our environment have been identified that may be related to cancer. The Society decided to Initiate a second study to respond to the concerns ol the public and scientific community about suspected carcmogena.

Research

Without the use of ACS volunteers, the cost of carrying out CPSII would total more than $100 million. With volunteers to collect the data, the study is es. timated to cost only about $9 million to complete.

Studies of Occupational Groups

A number of studies of union workers exposed to various agents have been undertaken in the Society's Intramural Research Program; the findings will have considerable public health implications.

It has been established that asbestos workers have a high risk of lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer and other conditions. Less clear, though, is the hazard asbestos exposure poses for the general population,

PuHciferh.s among people exposed lo very low levels. The ACS is studying the mortality of family members

SLSX^AP01* work*r* �w* insulation workers to determine if they ore at an increased risk of lung cancer and other asbestos-related diseases A study of shipyard workers wtH offer data on this group's cancer incidence and mortality rates.

It has been found that smoking cessation reduces the lung cancer risk of insulation workers who no longer work with asbestos materials.

Other occupational groups under continuing investigation include vinyl chloride workers, painters, rubber plant employees, those who work with poly-chlorinated biphenvte (PCB's), printing press workers, and health care and hospital employees.

studies can provide the basis upon which judgments of causality may be made.

It is recognized that no simple cause-amieffect relationship is likely to exist between a complex product like tobacco smoke and a specific disease in the variable human organism. It is also recogniied that often the coexistence of several factors Is required for the occurrence of a disease, and that one of the factors may play a determinant role; that is, without it, the other factors fsach as genetic susceptibility) seldom lead to the occurrence of the disease.

The Effects of Smoking: Principal Findings

Cigarette smoking is associated with a 70 percent increase in the age-specific, death rates of males, and to ft lesser extent with increased death rates of females. The total number of excess deaths causally related to . cigarette smoking in the U,S. population cannot be accurately estimated. In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the Committee that cigarette smoking contributes sub-stantially to mortality from certain specific disease* and to the overall death rate.

Lung Cancer

Cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs all other factors. The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction.

The risk of developing lung cancer increaws with duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day* and is diminished by discontinuing smoking. In comparison with non-smokers, average male smokers of cigarettes have approximately a 9- to 10-fold risk of developing lung cancer and heavy smokers at least n 20-fold risk.

The risk of developing cancer of the lung for the combined group of pipe smokers, cigar smokers, and pipe and cigar smokers is greater than for non-smokers, but much less than for#cigarette smokers.

Cigarette smoking is much more important than occupational exposures fa the causation of lung cancer in the* general population.

Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema

Cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of chronic bronchi' tis in the United States, and increases the risk of dying from chronic bron-otitis and emphysema. A relationship exists between cigarette smoking and emphysema but it has not been established that the relationship is causal. Studies demonstrate that fatalities from this disease are infrequent among non-smokers.

For the bulk of the population of the United States, the relative importance                                                                                             jrJJ

of cigarette smoking as a cause of chronic broncho-pulmonary disease is                                                                                          -^j

much greater than atmospheric pollution or occupational exposures.                                                                                                    -*

The Committee's Judcment in Brief

On the basis of prolonged study and evaluation of many lines of converging evidence, the Committee makes the following judgment:

Cigarette smoking it a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action,

B. COMMENTS AND DETAILED CONCLUSIONS (A Guide to Part II of the Report)

Chemistry and Carcinogenicity of Tobacco and Tobacco

Smoke

Condensates of tobacco smoke are carcinogenic when tested by application to the skin of mice and rabbits and by subcutaneous injection in rata (Chapter 9, pp. 143-145). Bronchogenic carcinoma has not been produced by the application of tobacco extracts, smoke, or condensates to the lung or the tracheobronchial tree of eiperiniental animals with the possible exception of dogs (Chapter 9, p. 165).

Bronchogenic carcinoma has been produced in laboratory animals by the administration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, certain metals, radioactive substances, and viruses. The histopathologic characteristics of the tumors produced are similar to those observed in man and are predominantly of theaqoamuiiB variety (Chapter 9, pp. 166-167).

Seven polycyclic hydrocarbon compounds isolated from cigarette srnokfl have been established to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals. The results of a number of assays for carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke tars present a puixling anomaly: the total tar from cigarettes Has many times the carcinogenic potency of ben*o(a)pyrene present in the tar. The other carcinogens known to be present in tobacco smoke are, with the exception of dibenxo f a,i) pyrene, ranch less potent than benzo(a) pyrene and they are present in smaller amounts. Apparently, therefore, the whole is greater than the sum of the known parts. This discrepancy may possibly be due to the presence of cocarcinogens in tobacco smoke, and/or damage to mucus production and

ciliary transport mechanism (Chapter 6, p. 61, Chapter 9, p. 144 and Chap-                                                                                                          Cn

ter 10, pp. 267-269).                                                                                                                                                                                                      <5

There is abundant evidence that cancer of the skin can be induced in man by industrial exposure to soots, coal tar, pitch, and mineral oils.   All of these

Surgeon General s Report

have only begun to show its vast heal th consequences, In 1965, an estimated 180,000 persons died from smoking-related diseases (USDHHS 1989); over the next two decades, that yearly estimate increased to 337,000, even though smoking prevalence had been steadily declining since the early 1970s (USDHHS 1989), First-time or long-time smokers in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s thus had far less opportunity than the next generation to personally witness the tragic but convincing demonstration of the health consequences of smoking. It might be hypothesized that this somber proof of the Surgeon General's report at last evoked a meaningful response among the surviving relatives and friends of the deceased.

From Disease Treatment to Risk Management

Another possible reason for the delayed response to the Surgeon General's report was its less-than-traditional medical perspective- The report's medical researchers were reporting not the kind of traditional clinical data that physicians were used to encountering in their literature but rather data from epidemiologic studies that indicated the risks of smoking. Eventually such data would be persuasive enough to mark a perceptual shift to "a new kind of numeracy among medical researchers and clinicians alike" (Burnham 1989, p. 19), But in 1964, most physicians were not prepared to understand�much less be persuaded by-the epidemiologic data represented in the report, nor to incorporate a public health model into their medical practice.

Accordingly, the medical profession did not quickly jump on the smoking reduction bandwagon that began rolling with the Surgeon General's report. The American Medical Association Alliance House of Delegates, in fact, refused to endorse the report when it appeared in 1964 (Burnham 1989). Medical personnel increasingly warned geople against smoking, but this precept did not carry over into practice. In 1964, smoking remained as acceptable in medical settings as it was elsewhere. Moreover, although 95 percent of physicians in that year saw smoking as hazardous, 25 percent continued to smoke (Burnham 1989); even by the mid-1970s, nearly one in five physicians was a smoker (Nelson et at. 1994). The AM A was criticized by other health organizations for not taking a more aggressive stance to reduce tobacco use. As late as 1982, for example, the association was faulted for help-tog P"^1* f�r Newsweek a 16-page "personal health care" supplement, in which the only advice provided

42   Chapter 2

on smoking was that a smoker should discuss the risks with a personal physician and should refrain from smoking in bed (Iglehart 1984). Soon thereafter, the AM A had become an active advocate (see "Toward a National Policy to Reduce Smoking," later in this chapter). By 1990-1991, only 3.3 percent of physicians smoked, although smoking rates among nurses were significantly higher (Nelson et aL 1994).

Some social critics of the time tacitly welcomed what they saw as a rare reluctance by the establishment to embrace a social movement. Sociologists and other outside observers of American medicine had noted a previous tendency of the establishment to "medicalize" social problems, such as tobacco use and alcohol abuse. From this perspective, medicine was

viewed askance as an ''Institution of social control," m a �new repository of lruth^ the pkce where abso_

lute and often final judgments are made by supposedly morally neutral and objective experts" (Zola 1972, p. 487). Implicit in this criticism was the feaT that the medical establishment was using its considerable clout��its professional domination of the world of facts�to translate all social ills into clinical terms that could be treated in a clinical setting. One such critic, medical sociologist Eliot Freidson, wrote that the physician who calls alcoholism a disease "is as much a moral entrepreneur as a fundamentalist who claims it is a sin" (Freidson 1974, p, 253).

But the medical establishment's initial hesitancy to join the movement to reduce smoking likely had little to do with scruples about overstepping its purview. There is no dispute that cancer is a disease and little dispute that the medical profession is the expert social authority for defining and treating it. The "moral entrepreneurship" of the Surgeon General's 1964 report was not to declare cancer a medical problem but rather to declare smoking a health risk�hence the central position of epidemiologic data in the report.

and sometimes reluctantly in the wake, and while social skeptics worried about the Orwellian implications, a battery of public health officials, politicians, and consumer advocates, armed with the findings of the Surgeon General's report, moved against the persisting social and medical problem of smoking.  Ultimately,

the broad cultural current that distrusted medical moral entrepreneurship embraced these efforts. The "de-medicalizing" movement, which sought to make health care both a personal matter and a political matter rather than one wholly under the guardianship of physicians (Starr 1982), supported a practice of medicine that took a preventive stance instead of an exclusively therapeutic one. Preventive action�to prevent smoking, and

Major Conclusions

The Health Consequences of Smoking

Forty years after the first Surgeon General's       2, report in 1964, the list of diseases and other adverse effects caused by smoking continues to expand. Epidemiologic studies are providing a comprehensive assessment of the risks faced by smokers who continue       3. to smoke across their life spans. Laboratory research now reveals how smoking causes disease at the molecular and cellular levels. Fortunately for former smokers, studies show that the substantial risks of       4. smoking can be reduced by successfully quitting at any age. The evidence reviewed in this and prior reports of the Surgeon General leads to the following major conclusions:

Quitting smoking has immediate as well as long-term benefits, reducing risks for diseases caused by smoking and improving health in general.

Smoking cigarettes with lower machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine provides no clear benefit to health.

The list of diseases caused by smoking has been expanded to include abdominal aortic aneurysm, acute myeloid leukemia, cataract, cervical cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, pneumonia, periodontitis, and stomach cancer.

1.   Smoking harms nearly every organ of the body, ; ; causing many diseases and reducing the health of smokers in general,

Chapter Conclusions

Chapter 2. Cancer

Lung Cancer

1.    The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer,

2.    Smoking causes genetic changes in cells of the lung that ultimately lead to the development of lung cancer.

3.    Although characteristics of cigarettes have changed during tfte last 50 years and yields of tar and nicotine have declined substantially, as assessed by the Federal Trade Commission's test protocol, the risk of lung cancer in smokers has not declined.

4.    Adenocarcinoma has now become the most common type of lung cancer in smokers. The basis for this shift is unclear but may reflect changes in the carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

5.    Even after many years of not smoking, the risk of lung cancer in former smokers remains higher than in persons who have never smoked.

6.    Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in men are now declining, reflecting past patterns of cigarette use. while rates In women are still rising.

Laryngeal Cancer

7.    The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between smoking and cancer of the larynx.

8.    Together, smoking and alcohol cause most cases of laryngeal cancer in the United States.

Oraf Civity and Pharyngeal Cancers

9.    The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between smoking and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx.

MEMORANDUM:

Study of the latest Maxwell Report in corrin nation with the latest FTC Report2 on smoke "tar" and nicotine, and other Information, leads to �* the conclusion that there is a gap in present cigarette product lines, hence an opportunity to market a unique new type of cigarette. For reasons which �will be developed below, this cigarette should deliver about 1.3 mg. of nicotine and 13 rag. of "tar", hence would have a uniquely low "tarM-to-mcotine ratio (T/N Ratio) of 10. No presently parketed cigarette falls at or near these specifications. There are good reasons to believe that the average smoker would like and use this new type of cigarette and that it ,is now possible for us to make it.

I believe that for the typical smoker nicotine Satisfaction 1s the dominant desire^as opposed to flavor and other satisfactions. There aVe wide � varieties of foods, beverages and confections from which a variety of flavor and other satisfactions may be obtained, if that were the dominant desire, but tobacco products alone provide nicotine satisfaction � therefore, that is the primary reason smokers smoke. What the smoker basically wants, I believe, is nicotine satisfaction accompanied by acceptable flavor and

mildness. Therefore, In designing any cigarette product, the dominant

*

specification should be nicotine delivery.                                                *

Data from the tiaxwell and FTC Reports, combined in Table 1, show

that the twenty leading brands deliver an average of about 1.3 nig. of

nicotine per cigarette; with individual values ranging from 1*0 rog. to

1.8 ir.g. par cigarette; fifteen of the twenty brands fall 1n the range

1,2-1.5 mg. of nicotine per cigarette.   On this basis, it is reasonable if

m.A   .f to believe that a cigarette delivering about 1.3 mg. of nicotine is $&"           satisfying and desirable to most smokers, and this 1s the basis for my

specification of this level for the proposed new cigarette.

The next specification to be determined is, in ry view, "tar'Vto-nicotine ratio (T/JI Ratio), this in turn specifying Htar" delivery.   T/N Ratio, as used here, is a measure of the amount of "tar" a smoker mist receive per milligram of smoke nicotine, and is calculated by simply dividing rog. of *tarB by rag. of smoke nicotine.                                ;                                     � -            .

t                                                      .                                              .                      i

!

In today's market it is reasonable to believe that, given the choice, the typical smoker will chtge and use the cigarette which delivers the desired, required amount of nicotine, with satisfactory flavor, mildness    � and other attributes, accompanied by the least amount of Mtar\   That 1s,

at the desired nicotine delivery, established above as" 1.3 mg. per cigarette,

*

the smoker should choose the product offering the lowest T/N Ratio, with other satisfactory qualities.

How much choice in T/H Ratio does the smoker really have? In view of the wide variety of cigarette products marketed, with wide variations in "tar" and nicotine contents, 1 had assumed that there would be a full range of T/N Ratios available. Surprisingly, such is not the case. As may be   3 seen from calculations shown in the Appendix on all 121 brands studied by  *

the FTC, only Carlton ("tar" 4 rag.; nicotine 0.4 mg; T/N Ratio 10} shows a T/N Ratio lower than 13, and at or even near our Specified nicotine delivery value of V.3trig., there is no brand with a T/H Ratio of less than 13. Thus at our specified nicotine level of 1.3 mg. the srwker must receive at least 17 mg. of "tar" � and usually considerably more � when using any existing brand. No other option is currently available to him, and therein lies a gap, an unmet need, and a marketing opportunity.

With our evolving new research technology, I believe it is possible to manufacture a high quality cigarette which will deliver 1.3 mg. of nicotine at 3 uniquely low T/H Ratio of 10, meaning that it will deliver 13 mg. of *tar\ There is no such product on the market, and I believe, given the option, a large number of smokers would choose and use this type of product if it were made available. This would be a satisfying smoke, with good smoke visibility and mouth feel; and with our current research knowledge in the areas of flavor, blending, smoke balance, and the like, I am convinced that it could have very good flavor and mildness. Using elements of the present discussion as a basis, 1 believe we might have acontpelling story to tell the consumer about our unique new product � a product with demonstr able, satis faction and quality.
pgNbr=693
DISCUSSION m REttftnEflQftHOaS:

At first glance, this proposal toidevelopa clgareUe-deliyering 1.3 mg, of nicotine and 13 rag. of "tar" wtth a T/H Ratio of 10 will . appear to be simply a restatement of the well-known objective of producing a "good-tasting, satisfying cigarette with reduced tar\   Indeed* the product proposed here does meet that definition, but in a unique way.  Host past efforts in this direction have failed, because ihty were based on nonselective reduction of "tar", letting the nicotine fall correspondingly � or deliberately reducing it further.   This, I believe, has been a backwards I,      approach, because it ignores the crucial role that nicotine plays 1n P       satisfaction and flavor, and it does nothing to reduce the amount of "tar"

"V'

per day the smoker must obtain in satisfying his relatively fixed per hour and per day desire for nicotine.        ,

,      In theory, and probably in fact, a given smoker on a given day has a I?{�***'*"'    rather fixed per hour and per day requirement for nicotine. Given a cigarette that delivers less nicotine than he desires, the smoker will subconsciously adjust his puff volume and frequency, and smoking frequency, so as to obtain and maintain his per hour and per day requirement for nicotine (or, more likely, will change to a brand delivering his desired per cigarette level

4

of nicotinej. Thus, despite the philosophy of our critics, there can be no virtue or logic in reducing per cigarette nicotine level below that desired by the smoker. Additionally,,if this be true, and if all leading cigarette brands deliver about the same amount of "tar" per unit of nicotine � that is, all have about the same T/JJ Ratio � then regardless of which

cigarette the smoker choses, in obtaining his daily nicotine requirement   �   ^!

he will receive about the same daily amount of Ktar". If. as claimed by       cu some anti-tobacco critics, the alleged health hazard of smoking is directly- J   o
pgNbr=694

related to the amount of "tar" to which the smoker 1s exposed per day, and

..,�.* 1     the smoker bases his consumption on nicotine, then a present "low tar, low �|A>V* i    �....................... '*........................ .........�..................................,......._,�^_

nicotine" cigarette#offers zero advantage to the smoker over a "regular" , filter cigarette, but simply costs him more money and exposes hira to

it

substantially .increased amounts of allegedly harmful gas phase components in obtaining his desired daily amount of nicotine. If he desires to obtain his desired per hour and per day nicotine satisfaction at reduced daily "tar" intake, the smoker currently has little or no option, A cigarette delivering 1.3 mg. of nicotine with a T/N Ratio of 10 would give

him this optfon, and Pbelieve he would take it.

�* '                                                                                       "���..

In recent months, there appears toliavs been a change 1n philosophy

among the critics of cigarette smoking. There appears to be an acceptance

of the fact that large numbers of people desire and will continue to smoke.     <

Thus, instead of arguing for prohibition or cessation of smoking, the        �

critics now turn their attention to urging that cigarettes be made as free

of the alleged hazards of smoking as possible. If we carry this to a      .

rational conclusion, we see that the reason large numbers of people will

continue to smoke is that they desire the satisfactions uniquely supplied

by nicotine; and it is entirely reasonable, then, to provide the minimum

satisfying amount of.nicotine (apparently 1.3 mg./cigarette) with the

minimum practical T/H Ratio (currently 10) in a product which the smoker

will like end use. The 1,3 mg. of smoke nicotine, T/N Ratio 10, product

proposed in this discussion would provide an affirmatjyejresponse tojhe

current position of our critics, "would fleet a currently unmet consider need,     w

and, most importantly, would be a product which the consumer would like and use. 2  ^

It should be understood that the nutrerical specifications given here for the proposed new product are not absolute, and may be altered slightly by more precise analysis of existing data (e.g., use of weighted averages, segregation of data by product type, etc.), new data, changes in smoking patterns, and the like.   What is important, I believe, is,the approach which I.have outlined, which is to:

1.    Set smoke nicotine at the minimum level necessary to satisfy the mass market.                                               ,        ".

2.    Adjust T/H Ratio to the lowest value consistent with available technology and consumer acceptance.

3.    Design blend, flavor, sraoke balance and the like, together with physical properties, to make a product pleasing to the consumer.                          x

4.    Adjust the particulate phase-to-gas phase ratio to a satisfactory level.

Jn view of the above, J recoimiend that we develop and evaluate a    *

prototype cigarette delivering 1.3 tag. of nicotine at a T/N Ratio of 10

as soon as possible.   I recommend also that we continue research ated

in this direction, with emphasis upon, enhancing the satisfying effect of

nicotine and upon further reducing T/N Ratios below the initial .level of 10.

The current meeting was called to help an ad                             ^

hoc committee, selected by the chief executives of the tobacco industry, do long-range pol'lcy planning in regard to smoking, and health. On the ad hoc committee are representatives of legal, public relations, and research executives; of vairtomis companies. Any long-range plans which' are developed are to be made known to the individual companies through their chief counsel. The ad hoc committee is to consider policy questions in general and particularly grants, contracts, the fate of CTR, etc.

As a means of introduction, Bill Shiinn described the history, particularly in relation to CTR. CTR began as an organization called Tobacco Industry Research Council (TIRC). H was set up as an industry "shield" ia 1954. That was the year statistical accusations relating smoking to diseases were leveled at the industry; litigation began; and the Hynder/Graham reports were issued. CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information, which was needed at court trials-. CTR has supplied spokemen for the industry at Congressional hearings. The monies spent at CTR provides a base for introduction of witnesses.

Bill Shinn feeUs that "special! projects'' are the- best way that monies are spent. On these projects, CTR1 has aeted as a "iron*"; however, there are times when CTR has been reluctant to serve in that capacity and in rare insWes they have refused, to serve in that capacity.

CTR began to lose their luster in the; mid-60's and the tobacco industry looked around for more beneficial ways to- spend their research' dollars on smoking and health.. It was at this time that special projects were instituted     � at Washington University, Harvard University, and UCLA.       �. Bill Shinn noted that the industry received a major public    *i relation "jplus" when monies were; given to Harvard Medical     C' School. He noted the First and Hind publication on the       �t  Sj

exposure of the nonsnwker to tobacco smoke was beeefieial     g

to the industry as. was Lacy's (Washington University) letter to Senator Morse commending th� tofeacco industry for its support of basic cancer research, at Washington University.

Major problems exist today because of the advanced! ages of most members of CTR's Scientific Advisory Board (SAB).  It: is felt that they would be of little use as witnesses today because they could not withstand the rigors of cross-examination,

Getting away from the historical story, Bill Shinn mentioned that the "public relations" value of CTB must h&  consideredf and continued, Also produet liability has to be defended*, therefore, the industry should not take any action which: will dilute the caution label on cigarette packages;. A very interesting point, made: fay Bill! SMnn, is the opposition's, "the case is closed with regard to smoking and disease." Therefore, they will not spend any more money on health researcn> fo^ wim tje willing to spend dollars on education to prevent youngsters from smoking and to discourage current smokers from continuing to smoke.  It is extremely important that the industry continue to spend their dollars on. research to- show that we don't agree that the case against smoking is closed. During the course of hiis remarks, BilU Shinn said we might need to have "baskets" into wMcb research projects can be categorized and supported. There is a "CTR basket" which, musjt be maintained for "PR" purposes. There are projects to be funded on research aimed at understanding the nature of various diseases.. There are projects which deal more directly with the diseases purported to be caused by smoking and there are projects which must be done for       ^

specific obligations.  It is interesting that this; proposal    ��

Q by Shinn is somewhat in line with the thinking; we had! planned  CJ

Janet Brown felt that there were, and still are, benefits from CTR being able to claim they are doing "free research" even though it is clearly recognised their support comes from the tobacco industry.

Jim Bowling added a bit: to the history. The TIRG was first established at Hill and Nolton PR when the government began to take action against the industry; i.e., the Blatnik Committee hearing. The Tobacco Institute: was split out of the: TIHC each to handle Its own function � science versus public opinion. Jiim* noted that in the past the industry has been very successful because it has been able to recognize: and anticipate trendls of both the government and the public; thus, when government action activity takes place,, the industry was prepared to react Immediately.

Ernie Pebbles noted that in the deliberations of the ad hbc committee,, the needs of TI have to be met. Arnold Hen son remarked that suits have been renewed against! the tobacco industry but the thrust of the: claims are now toward addiction; and drug dependence.

Bill Shinn comments that the ad hoc committee should be a broad policy making committee and not just a smoking and health committee,

At this point:, the writer discussed the

recommendations Philip Morris had for research by the

*

tobacco industry and1 the assumptions made in generating this proposal. The lawyers quickly commented that keeping negative results "quiet" would cause tremendous problems in court actions should the fact come to light that negative data was supressed. In general, the ad hoc committee was* favorable to our suggestions and plan to hear the other tobacco companies: in, the near future.

Ernie Peebles qwestiioned whether there is need for re�earcfaj funds for TI. It was thought that such fundk could be used by Horace Kornegay for political reasons- The writer felt that the rae of such funds for research should not be a unilateral decision to be made: at Kornegay's discretion.. The lieg-al counsel, in general, agreed..

Pebbles then* discussed the needi for expert witnesses; hearing in mind the members of SAB* no longer qualify. It was; questioned whether or not such witnesses should tee from TI.  It was concluded that they should not be supplied from TI, but TT people should find these expert witnesses.

The writer mentioned the impending problems with regard to cigarette additives. Alex Spears countered by sayijie we should consider the technical problems which we can envision* as a result of future protocols imposed on the tobacco industry because of OSHA regulations, etc.

Finally, those present at the meeting were asked to keep the dates of December 13,, 14, and. 15 open for the next; meeting.

article. Well-meant cooperation by True and the: cigarette industry in the promotion* of the article has been characterized as deceptive by some of the above persons and organisations, and in subsequent editorial comment in' , Advertising' Age and other publications read especially in* advertising and public relations circles.

"It can. be argued that these rebuttals and reactions have: been more harmful to the industry than if we had taken no

""action with respect to the: True article. Certainly HOI and Knowlton's employment of Mr* Prank and1 True's change of: *.---=,*-editors contributed to the plausibility of our critics'" k*r$$& statements in this case. But such unknown- ami unforeseen ,;i^ events can occur in the course of any of our projects.        �$&��'"



�';'/:.t

I believe, therefore, tha't we should1 proceed on the basis= that the technique of future projects will be checked and criticized by anti-smoking forces.

Similarly, we have to expect that the content of our efforts    . y;.

will be rebutted in detail by the same forces. In the

case: of the True article, detailed criticism was prepared

and publicized by the American Cancer Society,, andi also:

prepared, by the Public Health Service and publicized by       .. -:

Senator Magnuson. To a considerable degree the article      �...;� i,�;$*:.

was similar to the industry's own position in1 the smoking    � t ^.fe

and health controversy, as currently stated in our draft     ..;-;;.xv

"position'paper." (Tidierock, as, of April 8, is preparing!     .:���'/. V;t\

paper.):                                                                                                                        v.^ .-

It should be noted that our earlier project, the: advertisement , ,t . of the Barron's editorial, escaped noticeable rebuttal. The editorial" will be remembered, however, as an independent criticism of government activity, with no reasonable                           >;:.

.suspicion possible that cigarette interests were responsible for its preparation. The contrast with the True article is obvious both as to content and suspected source.

Assuming that both the technique and content of certain of Our efforts are thus subject to attack, including the filing of complaints with government agencies, and consequent negative publicity, the: "test" of whether we can "speak for ourselves," as proposed by Tiderock and approved in January by the Executive Committee, becomes exceedingly important, and� a priority project.

ktmonU is used by RJRT in the following tobacco processing operations, . (1) Denicotiniaation of burley tobacco (2) Aatooniation of reconstituted tobacco

Denicotlnization of Barley Tobacco

Dsnicotlnization of soma of ou- burley tobacco gives us greater flexibility in the types of tobacco we can use in our products to meet the constantly changing demands by consumers tor cigarette products with different ^ tar and nicotine levels. This process also permits w to partially or

completely compenscte for the year to year variation in the- nicotine content of burley tobacco.

In Uw RJRT ii*nieotini2ation process, burley tote ceo is first treated with gaseous sfltbonia, and then contacted with steam to renovo nicotine end excess ammonia. Since the iftajor portion of the nicotine in the tobacco Is present as nicotine salts (citrate, oxalate, relate), the major portion of tha 0resiJwil anroor.ia is present in the form of the amwniun salts of the acids.

� Denicotinizotlon produces the following changes in chemical composition of

burley tobacco and snoSce: (1) decreased nicotine content of the tob'-tceo; (2)

decreased levels of nicotine, related alkaloids, pyrazines and pyridines. In .

The ttagnitude of some of the cheiaical changes that occur in burley tobacco and smoke are shown in Table I. These-dttc were taken frow a report by C, R� Green el ah, RDK, 1976, Uo. 3.

^ Jtononlatlon of Reconstituted Tobacco

Studies on the anaoniation of reconstituted tobacco were started in 1073 as * result of R&D studies carried out during the 1950*s and early 1970- During the 1950*s, Dr. C. E. Teaguo, Jr, investigated the amsoniation of tobcoco and tobacco steals and reported drawatic improvements in the smoking qualities of avnonlcieU tobacco stews. anoke harshness ana irritation were reduced and taste properties were improved.

A  In Ui9 early 1970% i nwjor RiD program was initiated to investigate the physical chemistry of tobacco and tobacco stnoke in wi otteapt to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting sawke harshness, irritation; and strength. These studies led to the folllowing observations and conclusions.

"   (1) Tha pK of cigarette sifloke is important to smoke quslity and can be usta cs a xoasure of the physiological strength of smoke,

(2) taenia in smoke is one of the major pel controlling components.

(1) Philip Korris introduced the use of added ammonia in their cigarette

products in 1955. They use diammoniim hydrogen phosphate in their

reconstituted tobacco process to liberate arononiua pectinate prior to

casting a reconstituted tobacco sheet (RDM, 1972, Ho. 10). *

(5)  Philip Morris brands, especially Marlboro, began growing in sales very

rapidly after the introduction of edded aMmonia.

(6)  Correlation studies relating increased sinokc pH to sales trends showed a very strong positive correlation (RDM, 1971, lJo,1?>�

k   (7) studies of the effect of araaor.ia on smoke composition showed a

reduction in aldehydes, especially formaldehyde, and tn increase in the levels of pyridines, pyrannes, and minor alkaloids. Saoking ponel results stowed a decrease in smoke irritation and harshness and an increase in physiological satisfaction with increasing foMortia content.

Based en the above observations, it was decided to investigate the use of armoniated reconstituted tobacco (C7A) as a means of increasing the smoke pH of RJRT's cigarette products. MFO tests indicate that saiokers prefer produots containing 07A over products containing only C7 (untreated reconstituted tobacco). Since Uie introduction in CAMEL Filter in 1975, G7A has been tested and/or introduced in nineteen additional brands.

Analytical data show that the current ChSSt Filter, which contains both denicotinized tobacco (7.6 percent based on total blend) and G7A (27,6*1 percent based on total blend), delivers approximately 36 u^ of amnonia per cigarette in the

'BIOLOGICAL DATA Oil AMMONIA

Aiiwonia is a normal body constituent which participates in many of the body's catabolic and metabolic processes. Excess amounts of ammonia produced in the body are converted to and excreted as urea in the urine.

Aumonia or its salts are natural components of many of our foods. Also, i nuubcr of arorionia-containing compounds are considered GRAS when used as miscellaneous ?r.a/or general purpose food additives. These include awnoniura hydroxide, aananiur. bicarbonate, awoniun carbonate, amroniuni saccharin, ariroonium sulfate and araoniirfi phosphate. Other specific applications permit the use of ammonium caseinate, arajjonium a chloride, sforonia isovalerate, ammonium persulfate, ammonium sulfide, amoniua sulfite, etc. in food products.

Clearly, tte use of arononia in the processes described in this pf;per are similar to many of the applications commonly used in the food industry. Hence, there would be little reason to expect any undesirable effects.

Although the total aaroonia in tobacco saioke can be determined, the actual for* of the erosonia is probably as the salts of carbonic acid, isovaleric acid, and other Aorganic acids. Aunonia salts of acids, with the exception of the salts of strong acids such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, are usually less irritating end less toxic than free antnonia. Therefore, if we compare the level of total ammonia in cigarette smoke witf* the known biological effects of ammonia, we are no doubt # overestimating any effect.

Acute Toxicity

The acute oral toxicity (W^) of ammonia in rats is 350 ra*/kg body weight.   The maximum exposure for a two-pack-a-day CMEL Filter smoker is estimated to be )M m             �

of auti,onia per day.   A $0 kg person would therefore be exposed to 0.024 *� of esifionir    | S   �*

per kc of body weight. The LD_ i5 more than 1*1,000 times the ammonia exposure for a I w 3

Initiation Toxicity

Ammonia is & respiratory irritant and inhalation in high concentrations may cause edema of the respiratory tract, fit of glottis end suffocation* The lethal concentration in cats <LDr0) was determined to be 10,000 ppm for one hour.

Comparison of fraoker Exposure to Threshold Limit Value Exposure

Because of the extensive use of amaonia in camercial processes such as in the manufacture of fertilizer, nitric acid,.hy:lrazin* hydrate, nitriding of steel, etc., the safe exposure levels for workers in industry have been t(x>roughly investigate J. As a result of these investigations, Threshold Limit Values for emonia exposure h�ve "been established. It is of interest to compare the level of exposure permitted for ammonia in the vorlc place to the level of exposure for a two-peck-a-day CAKEL Filter smoker,

According to 1931 ACGJH recooendttions, the Threshold Limit Vtlue (TLV) for aftXttif* is 18 m/ro- of air. It is estimated that the average person Inhalus 10 %' of air in an eight-hour period < Interregional Commission on Radiology Protection: Report of Task Croup on Reference Man, Pergamon Press). During an eight-hour work day, a person working in an atmosphere containing 18 ng of ammonia per cubic meter of air would iiihole 180 mg of ammonia. This is 125 times the estimated dally dose for a

two-pack-a-day CAKEL Filter"smoker.

? These two types�of exposure may not be ccmp?r&ble because the occupational

# exposure is spread over an eight-hour day, and the cigarette exposure occurs during

irregularly spaced intervals throughout the day. According to ACGIII regulations, s

shorUten. exposure Hn.il (less than 15 minutes) to anonla et 27 �rf is

permissible. A ^rsm working in an atmosphere containing 27 mg of ammonia per cubic     w

w meter of air would inhale S.^ mg of ammonia in 15 minutes. This is over 203 tiwss ths     li
