1                           MT.   CCFER:     Thank you,   Your   Honor,   may  it   please

2                t he Court,   counsel ,   Mr.   Wilis,   meatiers  of   t he j ury,

3                good afternoon.

4                          Ji mri e Wilis  smoked cigarettes for   over

5                30 years,   and i n  1993 when  he was  52 years  old  he  had

6                surgery to  have  his voice box  removed.     At   the end of

7               t hi s t r i al ,   IvT.   Uterwyk is going to ask you to award

8                hi s  cl i ent   money because of   t he deci si ons t hat

9                Mr.   Wilis  made to begin smoking and to continue

10                smoki ng.

11                           And during  his  opening statement,   IW.   Uterwyk

12                spent   a I ot   of   t i me t al ki ng about   Phi I i p Mor r i s  and

13                R. J.   Reynolds  and the other   tobacco companies,   and  he

14                made a I ot   of   charges  and  he made a I ot   of

15                accusations.     Frankly,   I   think  he was  trying to make

16                you  mad.     And during the course of   this  trial   we're

17                going to have an opportunity to  meet   those

18                al I egat i ons.

19                          There's  one thing that   IW.   Uterwyk said that   I

20                agree wi t h and  I   ask you t o do i t   as wel I ,   and t hat   is

21                he said don't   decide this  case based on  little

22                snippets,   wait   until   you  hear   all   of   the evidence.

23                And  if   there's  anything  I   can ask you to do,   that's

24               what   it   is.     Please keep an open  ni nd  until   you  hear

25                all   the evidence,   because as you know from voir   dire, 1420

1                we go second.     We don't   get   an opportunity to talk

2               with you until   after   M.   Wilis'   attorney  has  gone

3                f i rst,   so wi I I   you  pi ease do everyt hi ng you can t o

4                keep an open  ni nd and  I i st en to t he evi dence?    I   woul d

5                really,   really appreciate it.

6                          And  I ' m goi ng to ask you to do one  more thing for

7                me.     As you  listen to the evidence that's  presented in

8                this  case,   I   ask you just   to  have in your   rri nd,   what

9                does  any of   t hi s  have to do with Jinmie Wilis,

10                because it   is  IW.   Wilis after   all   who's  in court

11                today who's  asking you for   money?    So what   does this

12                evidence have t o do wi t h  IW .   Wilis?    Is  there any

13                evidence,   will   you  hear   any evidence,   that   Philip

14                Morris  or   RJ.   Reynolds  fooled Jinmie Wilis  in any

15               way?    Q   did  M".   Wilis  have the information that   he

16                needed to make an informed decision,   an informed

17               decision,   whether   to smoke or   whether   to quit   smoking?

18                          And f i nal I y  I   t hi nk a key  issue that   you  have to

19                ask yourself,   did  M".   WI I i s  at   all   times  have the

20                abi I i t y t o qui t   smoking?    So did  he  have the

21                information  he needed and did  he have the ability to

22                quit?    So from the defense perspective,   what   is this

23                case about?    We think this  case comes down to really

24               three pretty  simple,   straightforward questions.

25                          The first   one is,   why did Jinmie Wilis  smoke?

1                Did he smoke because he liked cigarettes,   because they

2                gave him pleasure,   or   did  he smoke because he was  so

3                hel pi essl y addi ct ed t hat   he was  si mpl y unabl e to qui t ?

4                D'd  M".   Wilis  understand that   smoking could cause  him

5                to get   sick,   or   was  he in the dark about   the risks  of

6                srroki ng?

7                          Guest i on two:     Wiy did  he wait   so long to quit?

8                It   is  undisputed that   in  1993 after   he had the surgery

9               where he had  his voice box  removed,   that   he never

10                smoked again.     But   more i rrport ant I y,   members  of   the

11                jury,   he testified that   after   the surgery  he never

12                desired cigarettes,   craved  nicotine,   or   had any

13               withdrawal   syrrptorrs  ever   again.     IW.   Wilis  testified

14               that   when  he got   cancer,   it   gave hi m t he incentive to

15                qui t   and t he wi I I   t o qui t.

16                          The question  is,   why didn't   IW.   Wilis  quit

17                earlier?    Is  it   because addiction prevented  him from

18                qui 11 i ng or   i s  i t   because  he was  not   truly  motivated

19                t o qui t   unt i I   it   was  t oo I at e?

20                           IW.   Wilis  adnitted that   i n t he  1960's when  he

21                saw t he first   warning  label   go on the cigarette pack

22                he t r i ed t o qui t   because he knew,   he knew i t   would  be

23                better   for   his  health  if   he qui t .     Fie testified that

24                he t r i ed t o qui t   by  leaving  his  cigarettes  i n t he car

25               when  he went   to work;   that   was  his  method. 1422

1                           You wi I I   have t o deci de,   merrbers  of   t he j ury,

2               whether   that   was a serious quit   attempt,   because the

3                evi dence wi I I   be t hat   if   IW.   Wilis  had qui t   at   t hat

4               t i rre  he would  have  had  no  risk from smoking and we

5               wouldn't   be  here today.

6                           Dr.   M chael   Cumri ngs,   their   expert,   their   second

7               wi t ness  i n t he case,   wi I I   t el I   you t hat.     Fie wi I I   t el I

8                you that   if   IW.   Wilis  had quit   smoking  i n t he '60s

9               when  he saw t hat   warning and  he said  he knew t hat   it

10               was  bad for   him,   he would  have had  no risk and we

11                wouldn't   be  here today.     IW.   Uterwyk  i n  hi s  opening

12                talked about   dosing,   dosing,   it   takes years  of   smoking

13                to cause cancer.     That's why doctors,   the Surgeon

14                General,   public  health,   advise smokers to quit.

15                           Next   question:     Wiat   if   anything,   did  Philip

16                Morris  or   R.J.   Fteynol ds  do to cause  IW.   Wilis  to get

17                sick?    Philip Morris  and  Reynolds  manufacture

18                cigarettes.     They  manufactured the cigarettes that

19                IW.   Wilis  smoked.     IW .   W I I i s t est i f i ed t hat   he

20                smoked a number   of   the brands  made by  Reynolds  i n t he

21                '40s,   '50,   '60 and  '70s.     He said sonet i me i n t he

22                '80s,   IWarlboro,   made by  Philip Morris,   became  his

23                pri mary  brand.

24                          IW.   W I I i s  cannot   tell   us why  he smoked the

25                brands  he did,   although  he adni t s  he does  not   remember 1423

1                ever   trying a cigarette because of   any advertisement

2                or   promotion  he saw.     Now,   that's  not   what   IW.

3                Uiterwyk told you  in opening.     And as  the Court   has

4                reminded you  many times,   what   I   say  is  not   evidence,

5               what   IW.   Uiterwyk says  is  not   evidence.     Evidence

6                comes from the witness  stand.     Evidence comes  from

7               witnesses who are under   oath who are sworn t o t el I   the

8                truth,   and you're going to  have an opportunity to  hear

9                f rom IW .   W I I i s  hi rrsel f .

10                           I   t hi nk t hey' re goi ng t o cal I   hi m t o t he st and.

11                In addition,   he's  had three days  of   depositions taken

12                on three different   days.      I   t hi nk t he first   was August

13                2nd,   the next   was  a couple weeks  later,   the next   was

14                in  Novenrber.     So you're going to  have an opportunity

15                to hear   how M .   W I I i s  hi msel f   answer ed t hese

16                quest i ons.

17                          Now,   M.   Uiterwyk suggested that   we were going to

18                try to put   a spi n on  M-.   Wl I is'   testimony.     Let   me

19                tell   you something:     We're  not   going to try to put   a

20                spin on  his  testimony  because  I   have too  much

21                confidence and  respect   in you,   and  if   I   ever   tried to

22                do i t,   you would see through  it   and you would

23                rightfully  punish  me and  nry client.

25                present   the evidence and we're going to present 1424

1                Mr.   Wilis'   own words,   and you can decide.     You can

2                deci de what   t hey  mean,   you can deci de what   t hey  mean

3                f or   t hi s  case.

4                          So M".   W I I i s  t ol d  us  at   hi s deposition  he cannot

5                remenrber   ever   trying a cigarette because of   any

6                advertisement   or   promotion  he saw.      In fact,

7                M'.   Wilis  could not   identify a single statement   that

8                any t obacco conpany ever   made t hat   caused hi m t o begi n

9                or   continue smoking.     We asked  hi m t hese questions;

10               we'll   show t hat   you that   testimony.

11                           Now,   you know,   the fact   is,   and  M.   Uterwyk

12                alluded to this  in  his  opening statement,   anyone in

13                this  court room who wants to can walk out   of   it   at   a

14                break,   can walk across the street,   can buy a pack of

15                cigarettes.     I   t hi nk  IvT .   Uiterwyk mentioned at   a

16                7-El even.     Most   people choose  not   to;   some people

17                choose to.     And you know what ?    As  a society,   we

18                decided,   that's  okay.     Those are decisions.     We've

19                decided that   adults  in this country are free to make

20                t hem

21                           So what' s  M-.   Wilis'   cl ai m?    I n t hi s  case,

22                Mr.   W I I i s  cl ai ms  t hat   Phi I i p Morris  and  RJ.   Reynolds

23                hi d  i nf or mat i on f r om hi m and f ool ed  hi m about   t he

24                ri sks  of   snroki ng.     Thi s  is  hi s  case.     Fie cl ai ms we  hi d

25                i nf or mat ion f r om hi m and f ool ed  hi m     Fie cl ai ms t hat 1425

1                i f   he had t hat   i nf or mat i on,   if   he j ust   had t hat

2                information,   he would  have made different   choices  and

3                he would not   have smoked and  he would  not   have gotten

4                si ck.

5                          So those are the issues  I   want   to focus on wi t h

6                you this  afternoon,   but   first   let's  talk for  just   a

7                rri nut e about   what   i s  not   in dispute.     Can everyone see

8                that   okay,   read that   okay?    First   of   all,   there is  no

9                dispute,   of   course,   that   cigarettes  cause cancer.

10                IVT.   Wilis  alleges that   he has three separate cancers,

11                three separate cancers  caused by cigarette smoking:

12                Laryngeal   cancer,   bladder   cancer,   and small   cell   lung

13                cancer.     And  it's  true that   smoking can cause all

14               three of   those cancers,   no dispute about   that.

15                           Now,   let   me t el I   you what   we adni t.     We adnit

16                that   smoking was a medical   cause or   a cause in fact   of

17                Mr.   Wilis'    laryngeal   cancer.     Wiat   does  that   mean?

18                If   Mr.   Wilis  had  not   smoked as  long as  he did,   he

19               would  not   have gotten  laryngeal   cancer.

20                           But   Judge Nicholas  is  going to instruct   you,   I

21                believe,   that   that's  not   the end of   the story.

24                cigarettes were a medical   cause of   his cancer   or   were

25                a cause in fact   of   his  laryngeal   cancer.     Fie has  to 1426

1                show that   his addiction to nicotine was  a legal   cause.

3                That's what   I   was  trying to preview,   the difference

4                between cause in fact   and  legal   cause.     And  here --

5                you'll   hear   words  like this  --   in other   words,

6                Mr.   Wilis  has  to convince you that   but-for   his

7                addiction to cigarettes  he would  not   have smoked and

8                he would not   have gotten sick.

9                           Let   me say  it   a different   way.      If   M".   Wilis  had

10                not   been addicted --   that's what   he has to prove --   if

11                he had  not   been addicted,   he would  not   have smoked and

12                he would  not   have gotten sick.     Even  if   he proves  he

13               was  addicted,   he has to prove that   the addiction was a

14                substantial   factor   in  keeping  hi m snroki ng;   but-for

15                that   addiction  he would  not   have smoked,   would  not

24                cigarettes  behind  him

25                           I ' m not   going to talk  nruch  more about   legal   cause 1427

6                           Now,   I et' s  t al k for  j ust   a moment   about

7                Mr.   Wilis'   other   cancers,   bladder   cancer

9                that   smoki ng was a medi cal   cause or   a cause i n fact   of

10                his  laryngeal   cancer,   we believe the evidence will

11                show t hat   smoki ng  had  not hi ng t o do wi t h  hi s  bl adder

12                cancer.     Wiy do  I   say that?    It's  certainly true that

13                cigarette smoking can cause bladder   cancer,   but   there

14                are a number   of   reasons why we believe the evidence

15               will   show from the witness  stand why  it   did  not   cause

16                M.   Wilis'   bladder   cancer.

17                           Fi rst ,   t o put   i t   i n perspective,   half   of   the

18                people who get   bladder   cancer   who are M.   Wilis'   age

19                are  nonsnrokers.     Nonsnrokers  get   bladder   cancer,   too.

20                          Second,   M-.   Wilis  quit   smoking  in  1993.     He

21                didn't   develop bladder   cancer   --   wasn't   diagnosed with

22                bladder   cancer   for   more than ten years.     The evidence

23               wi I I   be that   once a smoker   quits  smoking,   his  risk

24                generally  of   getting cancer   from smoking goes  down

25                substantially.      It   really  goes down with  bladder 1428

1                cancer.

2                           If   a smoker   quits  smoking early  enough  --   and

3                t hi s  i s why the Surgeon  General's warning says

4               quitting smoking  now greatly  reduces  serious  risk to

5                health  --   if   a smoker   quits  early enough and stays

6                quit   long enough,   at   some point   his  risk of   getting a

7                cancer   becomes  almost   that   of   a nonsmoker.     After   ten

8                years  of   nonsmoking,   M.   Wilis'    risk of   bladder

9                cancer   was  about   the same as  a never-smoker.

11                Mr.   Wilis  never   had a primary small   cell   lung cancer.

13               what   he  has,   but   let   me t el I   you about   primary  small

14                cell   lung cancer.      It   is  one of   the  most   deadly

15                cancers there is.     In fact,   half   of   all   people with

16                small   cell   lung cancer   di e i n 6 t o 9  months with

17                state-of-the-art   treatment.     90 to 95 percent   with

18                small   cell   lung cancer   are dead in five years.

19                           In fact,   Dr.   Lui s  Vi I I a,   the oncologist   and

20                pathologist   f rom M arri   that   IW.   Ut erwyk  hired to

21                testify as  an expert   witness  in this  case on behalf   of

22                Mr.   Wilis,   testified  i n  hi s  deposition that   in

23                30 years  of   a very  active cancer   practice,   in 30 years

24                he has  seen only four   or   f i ve - -   no,   I   take it   back  --

25                he has  seen only three or   four   patients with small 1429

1                cell   lung cancer   who survived five years.

2                          Well,   not   only  has  M".   Wilis  survived  more than

3                five years,   whatever   was  i n hi s  chest   is  cured.     It's

4                gone.     M".   Wilis'   bladder   cancer   was  treated with

5                chemotherapy.     The chemotherapy  killed whatever   cancer

6               was  i n t he chest.     Wiat ever   it   was,   it   is  not   there

7                anymore,   it   hasn't   been there for   six years.     There is

8                no reason to believe it's  coning back.     Wiat ever   was

9                there i n t he chest   was  gone.

10                          And f i nal I y,   menrbers  of   t he j ury,   i t' s  i nrport ant

11                to know t hat   the tumor   that   was  i n  M.   Wilis'   chest

12               wasn't   found  i n t he lung;   it   was  found in a I ynph  node

13                outside the lung.     It   was the same type of   cancer   as

14               was found i n the bladder,   so no cancer  was  ever   found

15                i n t he  I ung  i t sel f .     A smal I   eel I   cancer   was f ound  i n

18                           Now,   the bot t om I i ne is,   medical   testimony  is

20                repeat   it   so we' re very  cl ear   where we are.     Phi I i p

21                Morris  and  R. J.   Reynolds  adni t   that   smoking was  a

22                cause in fact   or   a medical   cause of   the  laryngeal

23                cancer.     We bel i eve t he evi dence wi I I   show t hat   i t   had

6                           Ivenrbers  of   the jury,   it   is  undisputed,

7                undisputed,   that   even addicted smokers can and do quit

8                smoking.     The evidence will   be that   literally tens  of

9                ni I I i ons  of   addicted smokers  have quit   smoking.

10                90 percent   of   those have quit   cold turkey without   any

11                professional   help.     All   of   the experts  in this  case

12               will   agree --   theirs  and ours,   everybody  --   that   the

14                somebody  is  able to successfully quit   smoking  is

15                motivation and persistence.

19                efforts to quit,   chances are they're not   going to

25                either   Tuesday  morning or   Monday  afternoon.     And  Dr. 1431

1                Curmri ngs,   among other   things,   runs  a smoking cessation

2                cl i ni c  i n  upstate  New York  City.

3                           Fie wrote a brochure that   he gives t o hi s  patients

4               that   he treats for   smoking cessation,   and he asks

5                these patients:     Do you  have what   it   takes to stop

6                smoking?    There is  no  magic cure that   can  help you

7                stop.     Fie then tells  smokers  that   if   they can answer

8                yes  to these three questions:     Do you want   to stop

9                snroki ng,   are you wi I I i ng to make some changes  i n your

10                dai I y  r out i ne,   Ar e you wi I I i ng to put   up wi t h some

11                uneasy  moments  after   stopping?

12                           Do you  know what   M chael   Curmri ngs t el I s  hi s

13                patients?    Fie says,   if   you can answer   yes to those

14               three questions,   100 percent   of   you will   be

15                successful.      100 percent,   if   you can answer   yes to

16                those three questions.     So one question you will   have

17               to decide is,   what   would IW.   Wilis'   answer   have been

18                to those questions  before he got   sick with cancer?

19                           D d  IW .   W I I i s  real I y want   to stop smoking?    Was

20                he wi I I i ng t o make some changes  in  hi s dai I y  rout i ne?

21                Was  he wi I I i ng to put   up wi t h some uneasy  moment s

22                af t er   st oppi ng?    IWerrber s  of   t he j ur y,   you wi I I   have t o

23                decide whether   Ji mri e Wilis was  any different   than

24               the  ni I I i ons  of   Americans who were addicted to

25                cigarettes who quit   smoking. 1432

1                           There's  no such thing as  a safe cigarette.     All

2                cigarettes  cause cancer.     Filtered cigarettes,

3                nonfiltered cigarettes,   light   cigarettes,   menthol

4                cigarettes,   addi t i ve-f r ee cigarettes  all   cause cancer.

5                Do you  know why?    Because it's the burning tobacco

6                that   creates the cherri cal s that   cause cancer.     Bottom

7                I i ne i s,   as  long as a cigarette has tobacco in it   and

8                as  long as  you  burn it,   it   can cause cancer.     And the

9                fact   that   cigarettes  can cause cancer   has  been common

10                knowledge and known t o t he American  public for

11                I i t eral I y decades.

12                          46 years  ago --   I   was  nine years  old at   the

13                t i me - -   46 years  ago the Surgeon  General   published  his

14                landmark  report   concluding cigarette smoking is  a

15                proven cause of   lung cancer.      It   was  a bi g deal.      It

16                got   a bunch of   publicity.     I   was  literally,   I   mean,

17                literally,   front   page  news.      It   was  the  lead story  on

18                all   nightly  news,   and at   t he t i me IW.   Wilis was

19                23 years  ol d.

20                           Now,   let   me just   digress for   a second because IW.

21                Uiterwyk talked about   addiction and  how t he conrpani es

22                denied addiction.     Well,   the Surgeon  General   in  1964

23                i n  hi s  landmark  report   decided something else.     Wiat

24                he di d i s  he had --   he got   a blue ribbon panel   of

25                experts to look at   all   the studies  and all   the experts 1433

1                to write a def i ni t i ve r eport   once and f or   al I :     Does

2                smoking cause cancer,   is smoking addictive,   what's

3                going on?    And  he considered  --   the Surgeon  General's

4                conmittee considered,   is  cigarette smoking  properly

5                cl assi f i ed as an addi ct i on or   a habi t ?

6                          And do you  know what   the Surgeon  General   decided

7                in  1964?    It   was  a habit.     And the  reason why  is

8                because literally for   decades the test   for   addiction,

9                it   had to be intoxicating and it   had to have an

10                antisocial   component,   like drugs,   like heroin and

11                cocaine that   did things that   put   yourselves  at   risk to

12                use i t.

13                          So t he Surgeon General's  cormittee in  1964

14                expressly said,   looking at   all   the evidence --   and

15                they  knew about   brain effects.     Caffeine has  brain

16                effects.     We- experience life with our   brains.     Wien  I

17                see nry daughter   and  I   sni I e,   that   has  brain effects.

18                Everything we interact   with  has  brain effects.

19                Surgeon  General   knew t hat.     That   conmittee said,   when

20               we look at   drugs of   abuse and we look at   the

21                def i ni t i on,   accept ed cl assi c def i ni t i on of   addi ct i on,

22                cigarettes don't   meet   it   because they're not

23                i nt oxi cat i ng and t hey don' t   have an el enrent   of

24                antisocial   behavior.

25                          And let   me t el I   you something else,   members  of 1434

1                the jury,   lest   you  be confused.     The Surgeon General

2                never   concluded smoking was  addictive until    1988,

3                24 years  later.     And do you know how t hey got   there?

4               They  changed t he def i ni t i on.     They  sai d we  no  Ionger

5                require intoxication for   antisocial   behavior.     And

6                that's  okay.     That's  okay,   because the fact   is whether

7               you cal I   it   a habi t   or   an addi ct i on or   a dependence,

8                that   doesn't   mean it   can't   be hard to quit,   and it

9                doesn' t   mean you can' t   qui t.

10                           But   the fact   of   t he mat t er   is  up until    1988,

11                Reynolds  and  Philip Morris,   when they  said  it's  not

12                addi ct i ve,   agr eed wi t h t he Sur geon Gener al .     So we' I I

13                hear   more about   that   i n t r i al ,   but   just   for

14                perspective,   because as  IVr.   Uiterwyk pointed out,

15               we're looking at   events that   happened a long time ago,

16                and even for   some of   us that   were there at   t he t i me --

17                I   don't   know about   all   of   you,   but   for   me i t' s

18                sometimes  hard to  remerrber   exactly what   I   knew when  --

19                but   we're going to have an opportunity to do that

20                t hroughout   t hi s  t r i al .

21                           The next   fact.     Well,   since  1966,   that's,   what,

22                44 years  ago,   there has  been a warning on every

23                cigarette pack sold in this  country.     So what   happened

24               was,   you  have the Surgeon  General's  report   that   made

25                t he concl usi ons   I   j ust   di scussed.     Bi g deal .     Wei I , 1435

1                what   happens whenever   there i s a bi g deal,   Congress

2                gets  involved;   right?    So Congress  had a series of

3                hearings,   and they  passed something called the  Federal

4                Ggarette  Labeling Act.

5                          So one of   the things  that   Congress  required,   they

6                said,   effective January  1,   1966,   you,   tobacco

7                corrpani es,   you're going to put   a warning on the pack.

8                And t hat' s what   t he war ni ng is  goi ng t o say,   and

9                that's where on the pack it's  going to be,   and that's

10                how bi g it's  goi ng to be.     So we' r e goi ng to tell   you

11                exactly what   it   says,   exactly where you place it,

12                exactly what   the typeset   is,   and that's what   you do.

13                And that's what   the corrpani es  did.

14                          Three years  later,   they  said,   you know,   we're

15                going to change that   warning,   and we're going to make

16                it   stronger.     Then  in  1984,   they  said,   you  know what,

17               we' r e goi ng t o amend t hat   I aw agai n,   we' r e goi ng t o

18                have a series  of   rotating warnings.     Most   of   you are

19                probably f arri I i ar   with those.     Those are the ones that

20                have been on the packs  since  1984.

21                           Look at   the second one.     Can you  read  it?    That

22               was   1984.     Look at   the third one:     Smoking causes  lung

23                cancer,   heart   disease,   errphysema.     The second one:

24                Qui 11 i ng smoking  now greatly  reduces  serious  risk for

25                your   heal t h. 1436

1                           Let's  go back to the first   warning.     This  is the

2               warning that   IW.   Wilis  testified that   he saw.     At   the

3                t i me  he was  a 25- year - ol d  man.     Fie was  in t he A r

4                Force --   actually,   he  may  have been  --   no,   he wasn't,

5                he was  25,   because  I   t hi nk  hi s  bi rt hday  i s

6                January  2nd.     January  2nd,   IW.   Wilis?    I   believe this

7                came out   January  1st.      Fie was  a 25-year-old  man,   he

8               was  in t he Ai r   For ce,   he was  st at i oned i n  Li ncol n,

9                Nebraska.

10                          And  IW.   Wilis testified that   when  he saw t hi s

11                warning,   he realized that   smoking can be bad for   hi rn

12                and so he tried to quit.     And  he testified  he tried to

13                quit   for   two  reasons:     One,   he knew i t   would be better

14               for   his  health,   and also it   would save hi m money.

15                Now,   the method  he used was when  he would drive to

16               work,   instead of   taking  his cigarettes out   of   the car

17                and t aki ng t hem in wi t h  hi nq   he woul d  I eave t hem i n

18                the car.     Fie testified that   these quit   attenrpts  lasted

19                a couple of   days,   maybe at   most   a week,   and then  he

20               would go back to smoking.

21                           Now,   IW.   Wilis  said  he tried to quit   many times

22                over   the years.     Cbvi ousl y we asked  hi m about   the quit

23                attenrpts,   you  heard voir   dire,   that   was  important

24               testimony,   at   least   we thought.     And  he  really

25                couldn't   provide us  much information  more than that. 1437

1                IW.   Uterwyk told you  i n  hi s  opening statement   that

2                during  --   I   t hi nk  he said,   I   may  have gotten this

3               wrong,   so trust   your   memory  if   I   don't   quote this

4                exactly  right   --   but   I   thought   IW.   Uterwyk said that

5                sometime during the '70s  and  '80s  IW.   Wilis tried to

6                qui t   10 t o  15 t i mes.

7                          Wei I ,   I et   me  rem nd you t hat   what   Hi s  Honor   has

8                instructed,   what   the  lawyers  say  is  not   evidence,

9                because t hat' s  not   what   Ji nmri e Wilis  sai d.     Wiat

10                IW.   Wilis  sai d  - -   and we asked  hi m,   how many t i mes  he

11                t r i ed t o qui t   - -   he could  not   tell   us whether   he tried

12                to quit   more than five times  or   less  than five times

13                i n  hi s  ent ire life.     The  10 to  15 t i mes  in t he ' 70s  or

14                '80s,   I   heard that   for   the first   t i me as   I   sat   in

15                court   today  and  more importantly  I   did  not   hear   it

16                from the witness  stand.

17                          So we should  have our   listening ears  on about   the

18                quit   attempts,   when and  how many,   because respectfully

19                I   suggest   that   that   will   be important   testimony.

20                IW.   Wilis did say that   he used the patch once,   but   he

21                continued to smoke even with the patch on.     Fie also

22                sai d t hat   someone gave hi m a pi ece of   gum once,   but   he

23                doesn't   know whet her   or   not   it   was  nicotine gum     And

24                as  IW.   W I I i s admitted i n  hi s deposition,   he doesn't

25                know i f   he was  t ryi ng as  hard as  he coul d to qui t

3                away,   he never   got   rid of   his  ashtrays,   he  never   threw

4                away  his  matches or   his  lighters.     Fie testified he

5                never   tried  hypnosis,   behavior   modification classes,

6                he never   went   to a stop smoking clinic.     And you  know

7               what?    IVaybe those weren't   accessible f or   hi m     Fie di d

8                say  he  never   asked a doctor   for   help or   any  health

9                care professional.     Fie i s  a veteran and  has  access to

10                medical   care.     Fie said  he  never   tried to quit   with

11                anyone else,   he  never   asked anyone that   he knew who

12                had quit   how t o quit   or   for   any tips.

13                          So,   again,   merrbers  of   the jury,   going  back to

14                Dr.   M chael   Cunnings,   their   expert,   the question that

15                I   suggest   we think about   is,   di d  IVr.   Wilis  really

16               want   to st op smoki ng?    Wis  he wi I I i ng to  make some

17                changes  in  his  dai I y  r out i ne?    Was  he wi I I i ng to put

18                up wi t h some uneasy  moments  after   stopping?    Because

19               we do know t hat   IVr.   Wilis  quit   for   good  in  1993.

20                           He was  asked,   "Wiy did you wait   until    1993 to

21                quit   smoking cigarettes?"

22                          "I   had cancer. "

23                           Fie said that   getting  --   "You said getting your

24                larynx  out   helped you quit   smoking.      How di d that   help

25                you qui t   smoki ng?" 1439

1                           "It   gave me i ncent i ve.     11   gave me t he wi I I . "

2                          "And what   do you  mean when you say  incentive,

3                t hat   i t   gave you i ncent i ve?"

4                          "Gave  me t he wi I I   is what   I   mean. "

5                           It   is  undisputed that   after   IVr.   Wilis'   surgery,

6                he never   smoked another   cigarette,   but   more

7                irrportantly  he testified that   after   his  surgery  he

8                never   craved a cigarette,   he never   desired a

9                cigarette,   he never   had any withdrawal   syrrptorrs.     The

10                evidence will   be that   after   he got   sick  he never

11                wanted  nicotine again.

12                           IVerrbers  of   t he j ury,   IVt.   Wilis'   own expert   wi I I

13                adrri t,   as  they  must,   IVr.   Wilis  always  had the ability

14               to quit   smoking.     W believe that   unfortunately the

15                evi dence wi I I   be t hat   he di dn' t   have t he i ncent i ve or

16                the  motivation to quit   smoking until   he got   sick.     But

17               t hat' s  a question for   you to decide based on the

18                evi dence.

19                          So wi t h t hat   introduction,   let's  talk a little

20                bi t   about   Ji mri e WI I i s.     I   put   t oget her  j ust   a little

23                1941   in a little t own  i n Tennessee.     And as  IVt.

24                Uiterwyk told you,   when  he was young  his  f am I y could

25                no longer   take care of   him so from--   I   thought   it   was 1440

6                from their   dad's  garage,   and they went   in,   you  know,

7                hid behind the haystack and tried to srroke cigarettes.

he got   cigarettes  by asking people that   he saw on the

streets  or   people at   the Children's  Home for

cigarettes,   said that   as,   you  know,   a 7 --   5,   6,   7,

8-year-old boy  he would walk up to adults and say give

me ci garet t es.

And he testified that   as  a young boy,   none of   the adults  he bunrmed cigarettes from ever   told  hi m he should  not   be smoking.     IVr.   Wilis testified that   he had  no idea that   he should  not   be smoking,   although  he adnitted that   while he lived i n t he Children's  Home he used to hide his cigarettes  under   a tree because he di d  not   want   anyone t o t ake t hem

Now,   as  IVr.   Ui t er wyk t ol d you,   when Ji nmri e Wilis was  16 years  old his  mom came and got   hi rn   and  he moved with  his  mother   and  his  stepfather   to  Florida,

and  he lived with them     Fie dropped out   of   high school ,   he wor ked f or   a whi I e at   a gas st at i on,   and t hen when  he was  20 years  ol d  he j oi ned t he Ai r   Force.

IVr.   Wilis  spent   --   was  in the Air   Force from 1961   to  1967 in  Lincoln,   Nebraska.     After   he served his  country,   he was discharged,   came  home,   moved to Bradenton,   and except   for   going up to Tennessee sometimes  i n t he summers,   he basically spent   the rest of   his  life here.     So that   just   kind of   orients  us to where IW.   Wilis was  at   various  points  in his  life, various  points  in  his  time.     And this  may  be helpful as we get   t o t he next   topic,   which is  his smoking, because t hi s  is  a snroki ng case.     So I et' s t al k about hi s  snroki ng.

Wii I e it's  cl ear   t hat   Ji rmi e Wilis was a smoker, it's  not   clear   when he became a regular   smoker   or   how much  he smoked.     And that   is  because IVt.   Wilis  has told  us  many different,   inconsistent,   contradictory versions of   those basic facts.     In this  lawsuit, IW.   Wilis  has told us four   different   versions  as to when  he became a regular   smoker.

Now,   at   the beginning of   this  lawsuit,   IW.   Wilis f i I I ed out   somet hi ng cal I ed a veri f i ed worksheet,   and this  is  a legal   document   where you provide basic information,   you know,   about   yourself,   your   smoking

history, et cetera. So he see he si gned i t under oat f i I ed it wi t h t he Court . amended it once to make su i nf or mat i on t hat he want ed a second t i me, and, agai n, IW.   Uterwyk filed  it   with

Now,   i n  hi s veri f i ed first   information that   was about   when  IW.   Wilis  beca said,   I've been a regular that's  5 years  old,   born i worksheets,   1946.     Well,   o one of   the first   things  yo hi s deposi t i on,   you have a that's  a regular   smoker.

So we asked hi m i n  hi "Wien did you become a reg

" I   don' t   know when  i t

"Wien was  it   t hat   you regular I y  every day?"

f i I I ed out   on h,   and t hen  IW And t hen t hi s re t hat   we had

us to have.

22                          " I   can' t   renrenrber. "

23                          "Was  it   before you became a teenager   or   after?"

24                          " Now t hat,   I   can't   renrenrber."

25                           Fie then  had an opportunity to  review his 1443

1                deposition,   meet   with  his  lawyers and prepare

2                something called an errata sheet.     And what   happens

3                af t er   a deposi t i on is  if   you want   you can r evi ew i t ,

4                and you can  make changes  i n i t.     And t hen you si gn

5                that,   you  make it   under   oath,   and then you  provide it

6                t o t he ot her   si de.

7                          And in  his  errata sheet,   he changed  his  answer

8                to,   "I   don't   know exact I y when it   was,   but   it   was  in

9                nry younger   teens."     Then you  heard  M.   Uiterwyk

10                ment i on  Neal   Benowi t z,   t he addi ct i on expert   who wi I I

11                be t he f i r st   wi t ness  i n t he case,   so - -   and  I   t hi nk i t

12               was  July 3rd,   I'll   have the exact   date,   I   t hi nk i t   was

13                Jul y  3rd,   2009.

14                          M-.   W I I i s went   t o  M .   Uiterwyk's  office,   they

15                called  Neal   Benowi t z on the telephone,   I   believe

16                Mr.   Wilis was  by  himself   when the conversation took

17                place.     Dr.   Benowi t z  interviewed  hi rn   and this  time

18                Ji mri e Wilis told  Dr.   Benowi t z that   he became a

19                regular   smoker   at   age  16,   that   at   age  16 he was

20                snroki ng two ci garettes  a day.

21                           So,   you  know,   basi c quest i on,   when di d you become

22                a regular   smoker?    Well,   the first   information we

23                have,   the sworn document,   was  age 5,   then,   I   don't

24                know,   I   don't   know whet her   it   was  before  I   was   13 or

25                after   I   was   19.     Ckay.     Then we get   an errata sheet. 1444

1                Wal I ,   I   don' t   know if   it   was  i n  my younger   teens,   and

2                then we get   Benowi tz,   and  it's  age  16.      It's  been  kind

3                of   a nrovi ng t ar get .

4                          Now,   why  is  it   inrportant?    Because  Dr.   Benowi t z

5               wi I I   t el I   you,   and  Cunmri ngs will   tell   you,   that   until

6                you become a regular   smoker,   you're not   addicted.     So

7               you  may  be smoking,   but   you're smoking for   reasons

8                other   than addiction.     So it   makes  a bi g difference.

9                Was  it   20?     It   wasn't   5.     Wien was  i t ?    But   the bottom

10                I i ne i s we  have a moving target,   and  it's  an inrportant

11                question.     Now,   sinilarly,   M.   Wilis  had trouble

12                t el I i ng  us  how nruch  he smoked.     So back to t he t i me

13                I i ne t o ki nd of   ori ent   you.

14                           I n  hi s  deposition  he adnitted when  he was  growing

15                up i n Tennessee from age 5 to  16,   he would

16                occasionally smoke a cigarette but   has  no idea how

17                often.     Then  his  mother   came and got   hi m when  he was

18                16 and  he moved to  Florida,   and  he testified he didn't

19                know how nruch  he was  smoki ng  between  1957 and  ' 61   and

20                t hat   he woul d j ust   be guessi ng.     Wei I ,   at   age 20,

21                IW .   W I I i s  i s an adul t   and  he j oi ns t he ser vi ce and  he

22                moves to Lincoln,   Nebraska;   that's where  he's

23                stationed.     And the first   account   of   how nruch

24                Mr.   Wilis was  snroki ng when  he was  i n t he ser vi ce,

25                again,   comes  from the verified worksheet. 1445

1                           Now,   in those worksheets  M.   Wilis  swore under

2                oat h,   and,   agai n,   t hese were f i I ed wi t h t he Court ,

3                that   he was  smoking three packs  a day.     Three packs  a

4               day for   the '90s  --   from the '60s to the '90s.     So we

5                t ook  hi s deposi t i on,   and we asked hi m about   t hat.

6                          "And  how nruch were you smoki ng then?"

7                          "I   don't   remember   how much  I   was  smoking then."

8                          "Do you t hi nk you were snroki ng a pack of

9                ci garet t es  a day?"

10                          "I   don' t   remember. "

11                           "It   night   have been  more;   it   night   have been

12                I ess?"

13                          "I   st i I I   don' t   remember. "

14                          "And what   was  your   brand of   choice?"

15                          "I   really  can't   remember   which ones   I   was

16                snroki ng. "

17                          So three times,   doesn't   remember.     Later   i n t he

18                deposition we come back because,   you know,   obviously

19                i t' s  i nrpor t ant   t est i nony,   and we  have a ver i f i ed

20               worksheet   that   says three packs  a day,   and we want   to

21                get   a better   handle on  how much  he was  smoking  i n t he

22                service because  how much you're smoking,   some experts

23               will   say,   goes  to your   level   of   addiction,   whether

24               you' r e addi ct ed.      I nrpor t ant   i nf or mat i on we want ed t o

25                have. 1446

1                           So we asked hi m i n the deposition later,   an  hour

2                later,   same deposition,   first   day,   August   2nd,   2008.

3                Ckay.     "You do  recall   the brands,   but   can you tell

4                me - -   I ' I I   ask  it   this way  --   whether   you were smoking

5                I ess t han a pack or   more t han a pack whi I e you were i n

6                t he A r   Force a day?"

7                          "I   can't   remember   how many  packs  a day  I   was

8                snroki ng. "

9                          "And just   because you said  I   can't   remember   how

10                many  packs,   by that   do you  mean you can  remember

11                because you were snroki ng more than a pack a day?"

12                           Fifth time:     "No,   I   can't   remember   at   all.

13                          So we leave the deposition and  IW.   Wilis  has  an

14                opportunity to  meet   with  his  lawyers  and  review his

15                deposition,   and do you know what   happened?    We got   an

16                errata sheet,   and  he changed the answer   to,   "I   believe

17                I   was  smoking two packs  a day,   after   thinking about

18                i t,   I   remember. "

19                           IW .   W I I i s was asked these same questions  by

20                Dr.   Benowi t z  i n t hat   i nt er vi ew I   told you about,   and

21                he t ol d  Dr.   Benowi t z that   it   was  a pack and a hal f   a

22                day.     So you  have three verified worksheets,   February,

23                July,   and July  of   2008,   and you  have three packs  a

24               day,   you  have  I   don't   remember,   five times   I   don't

25                remember   on August   2nd,   you've got   after   thinking 1447

1                about   it   two packs,   I   remembered,   in October.     You

2                have a meeting with the expert,   one and a half   packs a

3                day.     Wiy does  the story  keep changing?    Nobody

4                expects  anyone to have absolute precise crystal   clear

5                recollection,   but   why does  the story  keep changing?

6                          So i n  1992  IW.   Wilis was  i n Tennessee wi t h  hi s

7               dad,   and he noticed that   his father   was  hoarse and  he

8                had a sor e t hr oat,   so IW.   W I I i s t ook  hi s dad t o a

12                Wilis was  hoarse,   not   just   his dad,   but   he was

13                hoarse,   too,   so  he scoped  him     And what   he found was

14               that   IW.   Wilis  had a lesion on  his  vocal   cords.

15                           Now,   we know f rom an  i nt ervi ew we' I I   t al k about

16                in a moment   that   IW.   Wilis  had with another   one of

18                t hi s t i me t hat   that   lesion was cancer,   and  he said,

19                you  need to get   that   taken care of.     Unfortunately

20                IW.   W I I i s  di d  not   f ol I ow Dr.   El I i s'   advi ce and  he

21                wai t ed a year   unt i I   t he I esi on had grown so bi g and

22                had gotten so massive that   it   was  making  it   hard for

23                hi m t o swal I ow and  hard for   hi m t o breathe.

24                          So i n October   of   1993  IW.   Wilis went   to see

25                Dr.   Howel I .     Dr.   Howel I   is  an ear,   nose and throat 1448

1                surgeon i n Tennessee.     And  here' s a medi cal   report

2                prepared by  Dr.   Howel I   on  November   3rd,   1993,   and

3                here's what   it   said.     "This  is  a 52-year-old white

4                mal e wi t h  history  of   four   years  of   hoarseness  and then

5                increasing dysphasia.     Fie was  seen approximately one

6                year"   --   this  is  November,   ' 93 - -   "he was  seen

7                approximately one year   prior   to  my  evaluation of   him

8                and told that   he had a lesion of   the  larynx that

9                needed to be evaluated.     Fie di d  not   pursue that."

10                           Now,   members  of   t he j ury,   it's  i rrport ant   t o

11                remember   that   this  record was written by one of   IW.

12                W I I i s'   t reat i ng physi ci ans  i n  1993  I ong  bef ore t hi s

13                case was filed,   long before anyone ever   thought   about

14               f i I i ng a I awsui t,   and t hi s  is what   IW .   W I I i s'   doct or

15               wrote.     And  Dr.   Howel I   deter nined that   the tumor,   the

16                lesion,   had grown so big,   it   had grown from the vocal

17                cords  up through the entire larynx.      It   was  so big and

18                so massive that   really the only choice at   t hi s t i me

19               was  a complete  laryngectomy.     So  Dr.   Howel I   performed

20                that   surgery,   he got   IW.   Wilis  some  radiation,   and  he

21                cured his  cancer   and saved  his  life,   but   unfortunately

23                           Now,   members  of   the jury,   this  past   August

24                Dr.   Francisco Civantos,   who's  a director   of   the

3                had  previously  retained  Dr.   Ci vant os  as  an expert

4               witness  on  behalf   of   IW.   Wilis.

5                           Dr.   Q vant os,   plaintiff's  expert,   will   tell   you

6                t hat   IW.   W I I i s  had cancer   that   started on the vocal

11                starts  experiencing persistent   hoarseness,   the cancer

16                take a very close look at   the larynx  because he

17               doesn't   want   to  ni ss  an early  cancer.

18                          The evidence will   be i n t hi s case,   members of   the

19               jury,   that   the same disease process that   was causing

20                that   hoarseness  ultimately  became the massive cancer

3                that   if   M.   Wilis  had only gone t o t he doctor   when  he

4               first   started experiencing  persistent,   chronic

5                hoarseness  and got   it   checked out   and got   the

6                treatment   he needed,   he never   would  have gotten

7                advanced laryngeal   cancer,   his disease could have been

8                ni pped  i n t he bud.

9                           He wi I I   f urt her   t el I   you t hat   if   M .   Wilis woul d

10                have just   followed  Dr.   Ellis'   advice when he was told

11                that   he had a lesion on  his vocal   cords,   it's  likely

12                that   lesion could  have been treated with  radiation or

13                a laser   or   by scraping the vocal   cords,   and again they

14                could have saved the voice box.     But,   of   course,

15                that's  not   what   happened.     Instead  M.   WI I i s wai t ed

16                until   the lesion got   so bi g t hat   it   became hard to

17                breathe and  hard to swallow.

18                          So that   takes  us  up through  '93,   beginning of

19                1994.     Ten years  later   in 2003,   ten years  after   his

20                last   cigarette,   M.   Wilis  noticed blood i n  hi s  urine,

21                and  he waited two  months  before  he did anything about

22                it   because he kept   thinking that   the symptoms would go

23                away.     Now,   because he was  a veteran,   he went   t o t he

24                VA hospi t al   in Tampa and i n 2004 he was  di agnosed wi th

25                bladder   cancer.     The cancer   was  a nixed-eel I   type with 1451

1                small   cell   components  and  had invaded the bladder

2                   wal I .

3                          As you will   learn,   the cell   type of   that   bladder

4                cancer   is  important.     Now,   because it   was an

5                aggressive tumor,   the doctors  ordered  CAT scans  and

6                PET scans  --   basically those are sophisticated x-ray

7                imaging studies  --   to see whether   the cancer   had

8                spread beyond the bladder.     And what   they found was  a

9                density  in the  hilar   I yrrph  node,   which is  a region  in

10                the chest   next   t o t he  lung.     They  ultimately took a

11                biopsy from that   area and found that   it   had cancer.

12                          At   some point,   they did some tests where they

13                corrpared the cancer   i n t he bladder   with the cancer   in

14               the I ymph  node and they found that   they were both

15                small   cell   cancer   and they  had si ni I ar   features.     Now,

16               why  is  that   i nrpor t ant ?    Wiy  is that   inrportant   in this

17                case?    Well,   it's  inrportant   because one of   the

18                questions  in this  case is whether   IW.   Wilis  ever   had

19                I ung cancer.

20                           Now,   I   want   you to t hi nk about   what   t he

21                pi ai nt i f f' s  posi t i on is.     PI ai nt i f f' s  posi t i on is t hat

22                Mr.   Wilis  si nrul t aneousl y  suffered from two completely

23                independent   cancers  both caused  by  smoking ten years

24                after   his  last   cigarette.     Their   position in this  case

25                i s t hat   he was  st r uck  by  I i ght ni ng t wi ce in 2004 - -1452

1                           IVR.   UI TERWnX:     I ' m goi ng to obj ect.

2                          THE COURT:     I'll   sust ai n t he obj ect i on.     That's

3                argument.

4                          IvR   COFER:     Ckay.      I'm sorry.

5                          So t he bot t om I i ne is,   did  he ever   have cancer   in

6                hi s  chest ?    We beI i eve t he evi dence wi I I   show - -   or

7               di d  he ever   have it   i n  hi s  I ung.     We bel i eve t he

8                evi dence wi I I   show t hat   he  never   had a pri mary  smal I

9                cell   lung cancer.     We believe the evidence will   show

10                that   what   they found  i n t he I yrrph  node came from the

11                bladder.

12                          We know he had a bi g  mass,   we know he had an

13                aggressive tumor   i n t he bladder.     We know because of

14               that   cancer   --   that's why they even did the  PET scans

15                and the CAT scans  --   we know t hey found the same type

16                of   cancer   i n t he I yrrph  node.     They  never   found any

17                cancer   i n t he lung,   and we believe that's  an inrportant

18                fact   that   you will   hear   further   from the experts who

19                take the stand,   and they'll   talk about   cancer,   how

20                cancer   spreads  or   metastasizes and what   happens.

21                           But   bot t om I i ne is,   everyone agrees  that   whatever

22               was  i n t he chest   is gone,   whatever   was  i n t he chest   is

23                gone,   it   was  cured.     Because what   happened is when  he

24                had the bladder   cancer,   they did surgery  and gave  him

25                chemotherapy.     Chemotherapy  is  a syst erri c treatment. 1453

1                You get   chemotherapy  if   they're afraid your   cancer   has

2                spread,   or   if   it   has  spread,   because basically  it

3                attacks  cancer   cells wherever   they are in the body.

4                So t he chemotherapy that   was  adrri ni st ered when

5                Mr.   Wilis  had bl adder   cancer   ki I I ed what ever   was  i n

6                t he chest.

7                          So  IW.   WI I i s  had cancer,   cancer   was found in

8                three parts  of   his  body,   his  larynx,   later   his

9                bladder,   and  his chest.     It's  undisputed that   whatever

10               was  i n  hi s  chest   and  his throat   is  cured.     But   as  IW.

11                Uiterwyk told you,   unfortunately the cancer   of   the

12                bladder   keeps com ng back.     So the question is,   did

13                smoking cause the cancer   i n t he bladder?    As  I   told

14               you as  a preview,   smoking can cause bladder   cancer.

15                Approximately  half   of   the people who get   bladder

16                cancer   are smokers,   half   are not.

17                          We bel i eve in t hi s  case t he evi dence wi I I   be t hat

18                IW.   Wilis'   bladder   cancer   was  not   caused by smoking,

19                and that's for   a couple reasons.     One,   as  I   told you,

20               when you quit   smoking,   your   risk of   getting  bladder

21                cancer   goes  down substantially,   it   goes  down quickly,

22                it   goes  down dramatically.     And the bot t om I i ne is

23                after   ten years,   a former   smoker's  risk of   bladder

24                cancer   is just   about   the same as  a never - smoker.

25                           In addition,   the type of   cancer   you get,   bladder 1454

1                cancer   for   a smoker   is  called transitional   cell

2                carcinoma.     This  bladder   cancer   was  a nixed-eel I   with

3                a small   cell   component.     Now,   he's  had recurrences

4                over   the years,   some have been transitional,   some have

5                been smal I   eel I .

6                           But,   agai n,   t he bot t om I i ne wi I I   be - -   and we' r e

7                going t o cal I   Dr.   Lonni e  Epstein to testify  in this

8                case.     Dr.   Epstein is  a board certified urological

9                oncologist   who's  literally,   literally treated over   a

10                thousand bladder   cancers;   that's  his  specialty.

11                           And  he'll   tell   you  it's  his  opinion that   smoking

12                had  nothing to do with it   because of   the cell   type and

13                the ten years  between the first   cancer   and the last

14               t i me  he smoked.     And we  heard today that   IW.   Wilis

15                recently  had another   tumor.     That's  been  19 years

16                now--   or   17 years,   I   apologize,   17 years  since he

17                smoked  his  last   cigarette.

18                          So for   those reasons,   we believe the evidence

19               wi I I   be t hat   whi I e smoki ng was a medi cal   cause of

20                laryngeal   cancer,   it   had  nothing to do with the

21                bl adder   cancer

22                          Wii ch finally,   that   takes  us to GOPD.     IW.   Wilis

23                claims  to  have  moderate to severe COPD or   chronic

24                obstructive pulmonary disease as  a result   of   smoking.

25                Wei I ,   yes,   snroki ng causes  CCPD.      15 percent   of   smokers 1455

1                will   eventually  get   CCPD.     And what   happens,   CCPD

2                includes  enrphysema and chronic  bronchitis.     And it

3                basically  reduces  a person's  lung capacity and can

4                cause a person to become short   of   breath,   can  I i ni t

5                t hei r   act i vi t i es.

6                          Wth  nild  CCPD,   there's  not   really  rruch of   an

7                effect   on a person because we have so nruch excess  lung

8                capacity,   that   even if   some of   it   --   if   you  lose some

9                of   i t,   you're still   okay.     In fact,   as we age,   we all

10                lose  lung function;   that's just   the  natural   process  of

11                agi ng.

12                           Now,   if   COPD get s  more severe,   if   it   gets  more

13                advanced,   it   can develop into a serious disease.     The

14                good  news  is,   though,   that   when a person stops

15                smoking,   then any  loss  of   lung function from smoking

16                also stops.     There's  no  latency  period;   it's  literally

17                any damage t hat' s  bei ng done i s  bei ng done whi I e you

18                smoke.     So that's why  I   say stop smoking  now,   if   you

19                stop now,   your   CCPD f rom snroki ng does  not   get   worse.

20                          And  IW.   WI I i s qui t   smoking  in  1993.     We'll

21                produce the x-rays,   the CAT scans,   and all   the

22                objective medical   records,   and they'll   demonstrate

23                t hat   IW.   W I I i s  suf f er s  f r om rri I d COPD.     So what ever

24                lung function  he has  that   was  caused  by  smoking got   no

25               worse after   1993,   and  it   will   be undisputed that   had 1456

3                          Ckay.     Let's  shift   gears  and talk about   another

4                issue you'll   have to decide.     Che of   the issues for

5                you t o deci de in t hi s  case i s t he ext ent   to whi ch

6                IW.   WI I i s was  responsible for   his  own injuries.      In

7               the conrpl ai nt   that   IW .   Uterwyk f i I ed on  IW .   Wilis'

8                own behalf,   he alleged that   IW.   Wilis was  partially

9                responsible for   his  own  injuries.

10                          You'll   remember   in voir   dire IW.   Uterwyk told

11                you that   IW.   Wilis was  partially  responsible for   his

12                own  injuries,   and  i n  hi s  opening statement   today  IW.

13                Uterwyk said  IW.   Wilis  accepts  responsibility for

14                starting,   continuing,   and  not   trying  harder   to quit.

15                          Well,   two comments.     Che is what   the lawyers  tell

16                you  is  not   evidence.     Wiat   comes  from the witness

17                stand is evidence.     The second thing is,   that's  really

18                i nt er est i ng because t hat' s  not   what   IW .   W I I i s  sai d i n

19                his deposition.     I n hi s deposition we asked

20                IW .   Wl I i s,   " IW .   W I I i s,   do you  believe it's your

21                fault   for   causing snroki ng-r el at ed injuries?"

22                          "IW/ fault?    No.      I   snroked cigarettes  and  I

23                coul dn' t   qui t . "

24                          "Is that   the  reason you're  not   at   fault?"

25                          "Yes." 1457

1                           We t hen asked  hi m,   wel I ,   whet her   he coul d  have

2                tried harder   to quit.     "Could you have tried harder   to

3                qui t   smoki ng?"

4                          " I   don' t   know. "

5                          "Wiy don' t   you know?"

6                          "Because  I   don't   know."

7                          IW.   W I I i s was then asked,   "If   somebody told you

8                back  in  1960's,   IW.   Wilis,   you're going to get   throat

9                cancer   unless you stop smoking,   would  it   be f ai r   to

10                say that   you would  have tried  harder   to quit   smoking

11                then?"

12                          "I   would  have said to  hi rn   prove it   to  me."

13                          " Wil I ,   I et' s  assume he woul d have sai d,   I   can' t

14                prove it   to you,   but   I ' m t el I i ng you,   I   know t hat   if

15                you keep smoking you're going to get   throat   cancer,   so

16                you  need to quit.     W)ul d you  have tried  harder   to quit

17               then?"

18                          "I   wouldn't   have believed him"

19                          "Can you think of   anything as  you sit   here today

20                that   somebody could  have told you back i n t he  1960's

21                t hat   woul d  have  made you qui t   smoki ng?"

22                          " I   don' t   know. "

23                          So f i nal I y  he was  asked,   " Wei I ,   IW .   Wilis,   how

24                nuch of   the fault   would you say  should be placed on

25                you?" 1458

1                           " I   woul d  have to t al k to  my  I awyer   on al I   t hat . "

2                          "Hownruch of   the fault   have you  placed on the

3                t obacco defendant s,   IW.   Wilis?"

4                          " I   woul d  have to t al k to  pry  I awyer   on t hat. "

5                          Actually,   menrbers  of   the jury,   that   is  not   a

6                question for   the lawyers to decide;   that   is  a question

7               for   you to decide based on the evidence you  hear   in

8                this  case from that   witness stand.

9                          And let   me suggest   to you that   the evidence will

10                be that   IW.   Wilis  knew t he risk of   smoking.

11                IW .   W I I i s  adnri t s  t hat   when  he was  gr owi ng  up hear i ng

12                cigarettes  referred to as  coffin tacks and cancer

13                sticks.     Fie testified  his  mother   was  a smoker   and  had

14               trouble breathing;   IW.   Wilis testified  he believed it

15                caused  her   emphysema.

16                           IW .   W I I i s testified that   when  he saw t he first

17                Surgeon  General's  report   he was  25 years  old and  he

18               was  i n t he service in  1966;   he somewhat   ignored it

19                because the warning didn't   tell   hi m why  smoking was

20                hazardous.     But   he said  it   also caused  hi m t o try to

21                quit.     Fie testified  he  never   threw away  his

22                cigarettes,   his  ashtrays,   or   his  lighters.     Fie  never

23                asked a doctor   for   hel p i n quitting smoking.

24                          And f i nal I y,   menrbers  of   t he j ury,   t he evi dence

25               wi I I   be that   IW.   Wilis  ignored the symptoms  of   his 1459

1                throat   cancer   until   it   was too late.     If   he had been

2                di I i gent   in f ol I owi ng  up on  hi s  chr oni c  per si st ent

3                hoarseness  or   if   he had at   least   followed up when

4                IW.   Ellis  said you  have cancer   of   your   throat,   he very

5                I i kel y woul d  have saved  hi s voi ce box.

6                           Ivenrbers  of   t he j ury,   t he evi dence wi I I   be t hat

7                since IW.   Wilis was  i n  hi s  20's,   he was  on  notice

8                about   t he ri sk of   smoki ng.     And t he evi dence wi I I   be

9                that   if   IW.   Wilis  had quit   smoking when  he saw t hat

10               warni ng  I abel   i n t he  1960' s,   he woul d  have  had  no  ri sk

11                whatsoever   from smoking and we wouldn't   be  here today.

12                          The evidence will   be that   IW.   Wilis smoked

13                because he wanted to smoke,   that   at   all   times  he had

14               t he abi I i t y t o qui t.     Fie understood that   his decision

15                to continue to smoke put   his  health at   risk.

16                          And f i nal I y t he evi dence wi I I   be,   members  of   t he

18                to quit   --   made up his  ni nd to quit   --   he di d quit.

10                Wfe're going to take that   15 m'nutes.     That   takes  us  to

12                           (Jury  out   at   2: 45  p. m )

13                           (A recess was  t aken f rom 2: 45 p. m   to 3: 01   p. m

14                after   which the following  proceedings were  had:)

15                           MR   UlTERWnX:     Your   Honor,   I   would  like to make

16                an objection.     You  know,   I   didn't   interrupt   him during

17                his  opening.     Fie started to argue the  law,   and  he

18                started to say what   the I aw i s  regarding  legal   cause.

19                Fie rri sst at ed the I aw as far   as  legal   cause.     Fie forgot

20                that   legal   cause you are required and that   involves

21                concur r i ng cause.

22                          And all    I ' m aski ng for,   Judge,   is what   he's  asked

23                and  both of   these guys  have asked during  nry  opening

24               t hat   advi se t he jury t hat   anyt hi ng the at t or neys  say

25                is  not   what   the  I aw i s;   you'll   get   instructions.     You 1461

1                did that   twice in  nine,   and  I   would ask --   I ' m not

2                even asking  it   for   twice.      I ' m aski ng  in  between the

3                t wo of   because he did  make an argument   regarding the

4                I aw.

5                          THE COURT:     I   probably would  have done that   at

6                t he t i me.     11' s  goi ng t o seem a little out   of   context

7                now.      I ' m not   sure what   t he jury  - -   what   t hey' I I

8                attach that   instruction to,   so  I'm going to deny the

9                request.

10                           I f   t hat   happens  during  IW.   Boyce's  opening and  I

11                f eel   i t' s  appropriate,   I   will   instruct   them,   rerrind

12                t hem t hat,   again,   this  is  not   their   instructions  on

13                the  I aw and that   happens  nruch,   nruch  later.      I   have

14               done that   many times,   I   think,   but   I ' m goi ng to

15                decline the  request   to do it   now,   only  because there's

16                no context   for   the jury.

17                          They  certainly won't   remember   M.   --   I   don't

18                think --   IW.   Gofer's  reference to that   an  hour   ago or

19                so and attach  nry warning to that   statement   at   least   at

20                t hi s  t i me,   at   t hi s  I at e t i me.     So  I ' I I   deny t hat

21                request.

22                           But   by  all   means,   if   you  believe that   an

23                objection  is  appropriate or   necessary during

24                IW.   Boyce's  opening,   don't   hesitate t o voi ce i t.     So

25                I ' m goi ng t o send t he j ury  home and we' I I   t ake up 1462

1                whatever   issues for   a good part   of   the remainder   of

2                the afternoon after   that.

3                           IVR.   UlTERVwK:     All   right,   Judge.     Thank you.

6                          THE COURT:     Good afternoon,   ladies  and gentlemen.

7               Wei come back.

10                          JURORS:     Yes.

11                           THE COURT:     Terrific.     As  long as you  have those,

12                t hat   wi I I   al I ow you t o par k i n any  of   t he desi gnat ed

13                lots  next   week.     I   wanted to make sure that   happened.

14               And as  long as  that   happened,   that's  terrific.

15                          The counsel,   IVr.   Boyce,   for   RJ.   Reynolds,   will

16                now present   RJ.   Reynolds'   opening statement.     You  may

17                proceed.

18                           MR.   BOYCE:     Thank you,   Your   Honor.     IVay  it   please

19                t he Court.

20                          Good afternoon,   ladies  and gentlemen.      It's  nice

21                to see all   of   you again.     I   know we met   yesterday

22                duri ng j ury  sel ect i on,   but   agai n  nry  name i s  Kevi n

23                Boyce,   and along with John Yarber   over   there,   we are

24                proud to represent   the  men and women who are the  RJ.

25                Reynol ds Tobacco Conrpany. 1463

1                           RJ.   Reynolds  is  an American conrpany that   was

2                founded  in  1874.     RJ.   Reynolds  has  been  making things

3                i n t hi s  country for   136 years,   and they're still   an

4               American conrpany today,   one of   the  last   conrpani es  that

5                still   enrpl oys American workers  and actually  makes

6                something  here in America.

7                           RJ.   Reynolds  currently  enrpl oys  several   thousand

8                people in just   about   every  state in the country.

9                They're  located  not   too far   away,   in  North  Carolina,

10                and they  buy their   tobacco f r om Amer i can farmers  in a

11                relationship that   goes  back centuries.

12                           Now,   today,   R. J.   Reynolds  is  owned  by  another

13                company.     That   conrpany  is  publicly  owned.     And what

14               that   means  is that   Reynolds  is  owned  by  stockholders;

15                and for   Reynolds,   that   includes  institutions,   pension

16                funds,   mutual   funds,   and  men and women all   around this

17                nation.     And that's what   Reynolds  is  today.

18                           In fact,   you'll   learn  in this  case that   R. J.

19                Reynolds  of   today  is  a markedly different   one than the

20                one  IVr.   Uterwyk wants  you to believe.     The one that

21                IW.   Uterwyk would  have you believe is  based on

22                documents  and snippets  of   testimony,   documents  that

23               were written decades  ago by  men and women who were

24                born around the turn of   the Century.     That's  one of

25                the things   I   want   you to remember   in this  case. 1464

1                           Wien you see a document   from the '50s  or   the

2                '60s,   ask Your   Honor   when that   author   was  born.     These

3                are  men and women who were born around  1900,   1910,

4                1920.     Thi s  real I y  i s  a very  I ong t i me ago.

5                          Wiat   Reynolds  is  not   is  some sinister   entity

6                defined by these snippets  and documents,   nor   is

7                Reynol ds def i ned by t he opi ni ons  of   t he publ i c  heal t h

8                advocates that   plaintiffs  are going to bring into this

9                case,   the kind of   people who would prefer   that   we di d

10                not   have the  right   to choose to smoke in this  country,

11                if   you want   t o.

12                          One of   the guys you'll   see in this  case actually

13                got   a f eder al   gr ant   t o si t   i n  hi s of f i ce and r ead

14               documents  about   tobacco,   and a grant   is  sort   of   like

15                an earmark,   but   he got   money that   comes  f rom t axpayers

16                from the federal   government,   and  he sits  in an office

17                i n Buf f al o and  he reads documents and then  he goes

18                around the country testifying against   the conrpani es.

19                And that's  Dr.   CunrrTi ngs,   and you've  heard about   hi m a

20                I i 111 e bi t ,   and you'll   see  him early  next   week.

21                           Now,   Fteynol ds  is  a conrpany that   makes  things,   and

22                I ' m goi ng t o  I et   you  in on a little secret.     Reynolds

23                actually wants  people to buy the products they  make.

24               They  have advertised their   products,   they  have

25                marketed their   products;   they want   people to buy their 1465

1                products.     And there's  nothing wrong with that.

2                Cigarettes  are a legal   product   in this country.     Cur

3                society  made its  peace with the risks  of   cigarettes

4               decades  ago.

5                           In fact,   the  risks  of   smoking  have been known  --

6                           IVR.   Ul TERWnX:     Your   Honor,   I ' m goi ng t o obj ect ;

7                i t' s  I egal .

8                          THE COURT:     It's  a little argunrent.      I'll   sustain

9                t he obj ect i on.

10                           IVR.   BCYCE:     You wi I I   hear   evi dence in t hi s

11                case --   and you  heard this  fromlVT.   Uiterwyk --   that

12               when  Christopher   Col urrbus  came here,   he saw t hat   his

13                men  liked to smoke,   he observed that   it   was  bad for

14               their   health,   and that   they  had a hard time trying to

15                qui t .

16                           1492 Col unrbus  --   before America was  America --

17                people  have known that   smoking was  bad for   you and

18                t hat   i t   was  hard to quit.      1492.      It's  2010 today.

19                           Now,   one of   the products  Reynolds  makes  is

20                cigarettes,   and cigarettes  are a dangerous  product.

21                There's  no doubt   about   it.     But   cigarettes  are a legal

22                product.     And  like  most   risky  products,   they  present

23                consumers wi t h a choice.     Everyone who smokes  has  to

24               decide:     Do the  risks  of   the product   outweigh the

25                benef i t s  I   get   f rom snroki ng?    That' s  a deci si on t hat 1466

1                each and every smoker   makes every time they decide to

2                have a ci gar et t e.

3                          And for   IVT.   Wilis,   the answer   to that   question

4               was yes.     The benefits  of   smoking outweighed the risks

5                of   smoking for   IVT.   Wilis.     Fie chose to smoke.     And

6                that's  one of   the main issues you're going to have to

7               decide in this  case:     Are you going to excuse

8                Mr.   Wilis  f rom responsi bi I i t y for   the choices  he  made

9                or   are you going to reward  hi m f or   the choices  he made

10                to smoke throughout   his  life?

11                           Now,   we talked a little bit   about   this yesterday,

12                but   you  have a very  irrportant   role in this  case.     And

13               when  it's  over,   you'll   be asked to  make several   very

14                irrportant   decisions.     And as we've discussed,   you  have

15                all   pronised to decide this case on i t s  own  merits  and

16                the facts  rel at ed t o  IVT.   Wilis,   and  not   si npl y on the

17                basis  of   some generic findings  made by that   jury  in

18                M ani .

19                          The facts  of   this  case are very  irrportant,   and  no

20               jury  has  ever   heard them before.     The jury  i n  M arri

21                di d  not   know IVT .   Wilis.     They  knew not hi ng about   hi s

22                case.     You,   and you al one,   wi I I   be t he j udge of   t hese

24                          Now,   you've probably  noticed that   we all   stand  up

2                have also  notice that   we rise when you enter   as well,

3                and t hat' s  because you' re t he j udge of   t he f act s.

4               You,   and you al one,   are t he j udge of   t he f act s  in t hi s

5                case,   and  i t' s  a very  i rrport ant   rol e.

6                          And so at   the outset,   I   want   to take a ni nut e to

7               thank each and every  one of   you  --   not   only for   your

8                cormi t ment s  to serve on this jury,   but   for   your

9                cormi t ment s to gi ve t he def endant s  a f ai r   shot .

10                          As  M".   Gofer   explained,   nruch of   what   you  heard

11                fromM".   Uiterwyk  had  nothing to do with  M.   Wilis.

12                I   was  sitting over   there and  I   t hi nk  i t   was  an  hour   or

13                so before  he even  mentioned  IW.   Wilis's  name.      It   was

14                Defendants  this  and  Defendants that,   and  it   was  a very

15                long time before he got   to Wf.   Wilis,   and  he  never

16                actually connected anything to Mr.   Wilis.

17                           Fie sai d  i t   quickly,   so  I   want   to  repeat   it,   but

18                he actually said --   he sort   of   asked a question and

19                answered it   himself:     Can we connect   any  advertisement

20                to IW.   Wilis?    No.     They  cannot   connect   anything the

21                tobacco conrpani es did or   said to M.   Wilis.     Because

22                of   that,   they  have a real   problem with their   burden of

23                proof   in this  case,   and  it   i s  t hei r   burden.     They  have

24               to prove their   claims.

25                          This  case is  not   about   whether   the cigarette 1468

1                conrpani es  acted in ways that   they should  not   have;

2                that   has already been decided.     It's  not   something

3                t hat   you,   t he j ury  in t hi s  case,   has t o deci de.

4                          The purpose of   this case is to determine whether

5                Mr.   Wilis was  affected  by  any of   this  conduct   such

6                that   he's  entitled to  recover   money  in this  case.     And

7                make no ni stake about   it:     Thi s  i s  a case about   money.

8                          Thi s  i s  not   a case about   publ i c  heal t h or

9                cormrunity  health.     This  is  not   a case about   whether

10                cigarettes  should be legal   or   illegal.     This  is  not   a

11                case about   the way cigarettes  are marketed or   sold or

12               whether   they should be sold at   all.     None of   those are

13                issues  in this  case.     This  is  also not   a case about

14               whether   cigarettes  are dangerous  or   not.     We all   know

15                that.

16                          There is  no safe cigarette,   and  no one who comes

17                in  here to testify will   dispute that   for   you.     But

18                t hi s  case wi I I   not   change t hose f act s.     Peopl e in t hi s

19                country will   continue to choose to smoke,   knowing the

20                risks.     And  none of   those issues  are  here for   you to

21                deci de.

22                          As  a result   of   the class  action  nature of   this

23                case,   there are certain findings that   we've discussed.

24               We've discussed them during jury  selection,   and you

25                saw t hem a bit   during  IW .   Uterwyk's  presentation. 1469

1                And as  much as  I   would  like to have a chance to

2                di scuss  t hose f i ndi ngs wi t h you  i n det ai I ,   I   can' t.

3                I ' m si nrpl y  not   al I owed t o chal I enge t hose f i ndi ngs  i n

4               this  case,   and  I   will   make no attempt   to do so.

5                           In fact,   unlike  M.   Uiterwyk,   I ' m not   going to

6                try to  retry those issues.     They  have been decided.

7                But   there are some significant   limitations  on the use

8                of   those findings,   and  I   want   to go over   t hem wi t h you

9                r i ght   now.

10                          The first   limitation:     The  Phase  I   jury did  not

11                consider   whether   any  class  members  relied on

12                Defendants'    misrepresentations  or   were injured  by

13                Defendants'   conduct.

14                          The second  I i rri t at i on on t he f i ndi ngs  - -

15                           IVR.   UlTERWnX:     Your   Honor,   this  is  totally

16                argument   --

17                          THE COURT:     Cverrul ed.

18                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     - -   of   I aw.

19                          THE COURT:     Cverrul ed.

20                           IVR.   BOYCE:     Thank you,   Your   Honor.

21                           The second  Ii rri t at i on  --

22                           IVR.   Ul TERW/K:     Can we  have an  i nst r uct i on on

23                that,   Your   Honor?

24                          THE COURT:     Ladi es  and gent I emen,   as  I   have

25                expressed previously,   I   will   give you the instructions 1470

1                on t he I aw t hat   speci f i cal I y appl i es to t hi s case.     I

2                have given the lawyers wide latitude in discussing

3               what   they think the evidence is  going to be,   what   they

4               t hi nk t he I aw i s goi ng t o be,   even t o t he ext ent   of

5                havi ng a verdi ct   f or m - -   part   of   a verdi ct   t hat   you

6                may see at   t he end of   t he case.

7                          But   at   this  point,   again,   just   recognize that

8                t hi s  i s  al I   t hei r   bel i ef   as t o what   t he evi dence and

9               what   t he I aw i s  goi ng to be,   not   necessari I y what   t he

10                evidence is  --   you are actually going to hear   and what

11                t he I aw i s t hat   I   wi I I   act ual I y  i nst r uct   you on at   t he

12                end of   t he case.

13                           IVR.   BOYCE:     Thank you,   sir.

14                          Secondly,   the  Phase  I   jury did  not   deter nine

15               whether   Defendants were  liable to anyone.

16                          The si nrpl est   way to think about   this  is  if   the

17                Phase  I   jury decided those issues,   there will   be no

18                need for   this case.     You're here to deterrrine this

19                case,   and those findings  can't   answer   the questions

20                t hat   you  need t o answer.

21                           They don't   answer   whether   IW.   W I I i s  r el i ed on

22                anything.      In fact,   you  heard f r om pi ai nt i f f s  already

23                that   they  can't   even connect   an advertisement   to

24                IW.   Wilis.     This  lawsuit   deals with the issues  left

25                unanswered  by the  Engl e case. 1471

1                           Now,   at   the end of   this trial,   you are going to

2                know al I   about   IW.   Wilis.     You' I I   know t he f act s  of

3                hi s  I i f e,   you'll   know t he information  he  had,   you'll

4                know t he deci si ons  he made about   smoki ng,   and you' I I

5                know t he reasons why  he decided why  he decided to

6                start   and continue smoking.     None of   that   relates  to

7               the  Phase  I   findings.     Those findings  can't   answer

8                t hose quest i ons  in t hi s  case.

9                          One of   the things you'll   see in this case --   and

10                IW.   Gofer   touched on this  briefly --   is the difference

11                between what   IW.   Wilis told us  in  his first

12                deposi t i on - -   and a deposi t i on is  r eal I y j ust   an

13                opportunity  before a t r i al   for   lawyers to ask

14               witnesses  questions  under   oath.

15                          So t hey' r e swor n  i n j ust   I i ke t hey  ar e i n cour t,

16               we get   to ask t hem quest i ons,   we get   to hear   their

17                answers,   and  it's  all   written down on a transcript.

18                           But   there  have been  numerous  changes  between

19                IW.   Wllis's  first   statements  under   oath,   his

20                subsequent   testimony,   his  revisions  t o hi s  testimony,

21                his  statements t o hi s  own experts,   and the evidence

22                that   IW.   Uiterwyk wants  you to believe in this  case

23                now.

You,   and you alone,   are going to have to decide whet her   you can  bel i eve any of   t hi s  or   whet her,   gi ven

all   the changes  and all   the revisions,   you can believe anyt hi ng.

But   the changes  to Wt.   Wilis's  testimony  are  not t he onl y i nconsi st enci es you' I I   see in t hi s  case, a her  witnesses  have also changed their   testimony.     So I   woul d  I i ke you t o wat ch f or   t hose i nconsi st enci es  as this trial   goes  on,   and to think about   this  issue as we di scuss what   t he evi dence wi I I   show in t hi s  case.

Now,   I ' m goi ng to do  nry  best   dur i ng this  t r i al not   to  repeat   what   you  heard fromlW.   Gofer,   but   we do overlap and  I   would ask for   your   patience if   you think I ' m repeat i ng sonret hi ng.     But   I'm goi ng t o do  nry  best to focus on some unique and special   issues.

And because of   that,   there's just   two issues that I   want   to discuss with you  here during  nry t

ssues

me.

s  chose

have Morri s. .   Wilis

to

And IW. Wilis he want ed to be bi g remenrber nruch about remenrbers the brand.

Fi r st, t he evi dence wi I I show t hat IW. W I I begin and continue smoking for reasons that not hi ng to do wi t h  R J.   Reynol ds  or   Phi I i p

Second,   t he evi dence wi I I   show t hat   IW former   smoking did  not   cause the bladder   cancer   that he developed ten years  after   he quit   smoking.

Let's focus on the first   issue in a little bit more det ai I .     The evi dence in t hi s  case wi I I   be t hat IW.   Wilis  had  hi s f i r st   ci gar et t e wi t h  hi s  br ot her when  he was  about   five years  old.     Pis  brother   got

some cigarettes from their   father's  garage,   brought t hem out,   and  he and  IVr.   Wilis went   and  had one behi nd t he hayst ack.

t est i f i ed t hat   he di d t hi s  because or   grown  up.     IW.   Wilis doesn't that   first   cigarette,   but   he Fie doesn't   remenrber   how i t   made hi m f eel   or   if   he coughed or   if   he got   sick,   but   he remembers  it   was  a Camel.     The only thing  he remenrbers i s t hat   it   was  a Camel,   a Camel-brand cigarette,   and Camel   is  made by  my client,   R. J.   Reynolds.

But   t he evi dence in t hi s  case wi I I   be t hat   t hese are very conmron  reasons  for   trying a cigarette.     IWiny people started smoking because their   friends smoked or their   siblings  smoked or   their   parents smoked.     It's very  conmron.

But   what   i s cl ear   i s t hat   t here wi I I   be no evidence that   IW.   Wilis  had that   first   cigarette because of   anything that   the  Defendants  in this case did or   did  not   do.     There is  simply  no connection between the  Defendants  and  IW.   Wilis'   choices  about snoki ng.

But   you  know what   is  interesting about IW .   W I I i s' s  first   ci gar et t e?    Even t hough  he was  f i ve years old,   he knew enough about   smoking at   t he t i me t o

hide.     Fie and his  brother,   they didn't   light   up in front   of   their   father.     They went   and  hid behind a haystack.     Fie's five years  old.     Fie knows enough about snoki ng at   f i ve t o hi de what   he' s doi ng.     Fie knew i t was wrong.     That' s what   t he evi dence wi I I   be i n t hi s case.     Fie went   and  hi d behi nd a hayst ack wi t h  hi s brother   when  he had that   first   cigarette.

Now,   IW.   Wilis didn't   become a regular   smoker   at

9                t hi s  t i me,   and you've  heard this  already.     That

10                happened  nruch  later,   when  he was  probably around  18.

11                16,   17,   18,   somewhere in there is when  he became a

12                regular,   daily smoker   of   cigarettes.

13                           But   for   this  very first   cigarette,   when  he was

14               five years  ol d  i n  1946,   he already  knew enough about

15                smoking to  hide what   he was doing.     Even though  he

16                knew enough to hi de when he was f i ve,   when we t ook  hi s

17               deposition in this  case,   he couldn't   tell   us that   he

18                knew t hat   smoking was  something that   children

19                shouldn't   do.

22                is  M'.   Wllis's  stepdaughter   that   you  heard about   from

23                IW.   Uterwyk.     Her   full   name is  Donna Rouse.

24                          As  a father   figure,   did you try to teach  Donna

25                r i ght   f rom wrong? 1475

1                           I   woul d say so.

2                           D d you  know at   t hat   t i me or   di d you bel i eve at

3                that   time that   smoking was wrong for   children?

4                          Answer:     I   don't   know at   that   time.

5                          We took  NTs.   Ftouse's deposition in this case as

6               wel I .     And t he f i r st   t i me we t al ked to IW s.   Ftouse,   she

7               t ol d  us  that   she recalls  IW.   Wilis  telling  her   --

8                and,   again,   I   think they  lived together   somewhere in

9                the  nrid-'70s  --   the dates  are a little unclear   --   but

10                Mr.   Wilis was  married to  rvT s.   Rouse's  mother   from

11                1970 to  1975,   and so it's  somewhere i n t he early to

12                rri d-' 70s that   they  are  living together.

13                          And  Mrs.   Rouse told us that   she  recalled clearly

14               t hat   IvT.   Wl I i s t ol d  her   that   smoking was a bad,   nasty

15                habit,   and that   she shouldn't   get   started.     M-.   Wilis

16                said  he didn't   want   her   to smoke because it's

17                unhealthy,   and  he told  her   that   he didn't   like

18                Mrs.   Ftouse buying cigarettes  for   their   grandmother

19                because she was  ni ne and because she was too young.

20                          That's  the same t hi ng  M*.   Wilis  knew when  he was

21                five.     11' s  not   a habit   or   something that   kids  should

22                be doing.     There's  nothing wrong with that,   but

23                Mr.   Wilis  couldn't   adnl t   that   i n  hi s  deposition.

24                          But   you  know what' s  really weird?    rvT s.   Rouse

25                changed  her   story,   too.     There's  a second deposition 1476

1                of   IWs.   Ftouse.     Now,   this  one wasn't   taken  by the

2                Defendants;   this  one was taken by  IW.   Uterwyk

3                hi msel f .

4                          And in  her   second deposition,   NTs.   Rouse said

5                Mr.   Wilis  never   told  her   that   smoking was  bad for

6                her,   and she explained that   IW.   Wilis  never   discussed

7               with  her   whether   cigarettes were  harmful.

8                          You will   hear   fromM".   Wilis'   aunt,   IVargaret

9                Tester,   that   she t ol d  Mr.   Wilis  that   he shouldn't

10                smoke,   that   it   was  bad for   him     Same thing  he knew

11                when  he was five years  old.

12                           But   Mh.   Wilis  couldn't   adnl t   this  either.

13                M'.   Wilis  actually testified in this  case that   no one

14                ever   in  his  life told  hi m t hat   he should  not   smoke.

15                And  here's  his  testimony:

16                          Wien's  the first   time you can  remember   anybody

17               telling you that   you shouldn't   smoke?

18                           I   can't   remember   that,   or   anybody told  me that.

19                           Do you  remember   growi ng  up that   you  had a

20                conversation with anybody where they  said,   Ji rmi e,   you

21                shoul dn' t   be smoki ng?

22                           No.

23                           M*.   Wilis's  testimony  is that   no one told  him

24               t hat   he shoul dn' t   smoke.

25                           Now,   I adi es  and gent I enren,   you don' t   check your 1477

1                common sense at   t he medi cal   det ect or   when you come

2                i nt o t hi s  courthouse.     You  bring  it   with you into this

3                r oom,   and you' I I   t ake it   wi t h you i nt o t he jury  r oom

4               when you go to deliberate.

5                          And  I   ask you to keep that   sense of   common sense

6                keenly tuned in this  case,   and ask yourself   as  it   goes

7                along:     Wiat   sounds  right   and  believable and what

8                sounds  scripted for   litigation?    Wiat   sounds  like it's

9                been changed or   revised or   prepared to help someone

10                prove their   case in court?

11                           I   ask you  now t o I i st en t o al I   of   the evidence

12                f rom bot h si des  of   t hi s  case.     You wi I I   have t o

13                decide,   when it's  over,   whether   to believe the

14               detailed account   that   Mrs.   Ftouse gave in  her   first

15                deposition,   or   whether   to believe her   revised story  in

16                her   second deposition where she says those

17                conversations  si nrpl y  never   took  place.

18                           But   I'll   tell   you this:     Wfe' I I   hear   from

19                Dr.   Benowitz,   who you've heard f rom descr i bed already,

20                an expert   on addiction.     Dr.   Benowitz  acknowledges

21                that   people suing for   money  have a motivation to give

22                him scripted answers,   and  he explains  that   if   there

23                are marked inconsistencies  between what   he's told and

24               what's  in a sworn deposition,   that   that   creates  real

25                problems.     Fie's  not   quite sure which to believe. 1478

1                           Dr.   Cunnings  offered the same opinion.     Fie noted

2                that   M".   Wilis  answered the same question one way  in

3                his deposition,   and answered it   differently  later   when

4                he was  meet i ng wi t h t he exper t   he hi r ed t o  hel p hi m i n

5                this  case.     And  Dr.   Cunnings  acknowledges that   the

6                answers  are inconsistent.

7                          Now,   Plaintiff's  attenrpt   to shape his  case aside,

8                t he evi dence wi I I   be t hat   M".   Wilis  act ual I y  knew f ar

9                more about   smoking than  it   was  something that   kids

10                should  not   do or   that   it   was  bad for   him

11                           IVr.   W I I i s  t est i f i ed t hat   when  he was  gr owi ng  up,

12                he knew t hat   people called cigarettes  "coffin tacks"

13                and  "cancer   sticks."     Fie remenrbers  hearing  both of

14               those terms when  he was  growing  up,   and  he  remenrbers

15                hearing both of   t hem used to describe cigarettes.

16                That's  a level   of   personal   awareness that's  hard to

17                match.

18                           Knowi ng t hat   a ci gar et t e wi I I   put   anot her   t ack  i n

19                your   cof f i n or   t hat   i t' s a st i ck of   cancer   i s

20                something that   IVr.   Wilis  knew before  he ever   made  his

21                choice to become a regular,   daily smoker.     Fie knew

22                enough to  hi de when  he was  f i ve.

23                          And as  he was  growing  up,   before  he started

24                smoking every day,   before  Plaintiff's  experts  argued

25                that   he  lost   control   of   hi s  abi I i t y t o control 1479

1                smoki ng.

2                          And that's  really  --   just   on a side  note,   that's

3                really what   this case is about.     It's  one thing to say

4                someone is  addicted,   or   dependent,   or   has a habit.

5                The  real   issue is:     Can you control   your   behavior?

6                           PI ai nt i f f s want   you to bel i eve t hat   M .   Wilis

7               was  unable to control   himself,   that   he smoked because

8                of   an addi ct i on to ni cot i ne.     That's the cause

9                question.     Did  he  lose control   of   himself?    D d  he

10                lose the ability to control   his  behavior?

11                           But   regardless of   when that   happened --

12                PI ai nt i f f' s  expert s t hi nk it   happened sonret i me when  he

13               was   16,   17,   or   18,   and we'll   talk about   this  in detail

14                i n a ni nut e.     But   before  Plaintiff's  experts  say that

15                he couldn't   control   his  behavior,   when  he was  in this

16                experimentation  phase that   M.   Uiterwyk described,   he

17                knew enough to hide,   and he knew peopl e called

18                cigarettes  "cancer   sticks"   and "coffin tacks."

19                "Cancer   sticks"   and "coffin tacks."

20                           Now,   I   do want   t o t ake a ni nut e to comment   on

21                this  experimentation  phase that   M.   Uiterwyk described

22                because  I   t hi nk  i t   shows two important   points:     One,

23                it   shows that   IW.   Wilis was  in control   of   his

24                smoking.      If   you don't   smoke every day or   if   you just

25                smoke a coupl e ci gar et t es  a day,   even  PI ai nt i f f' s 1480

1                experts  acknowledge,   you're in control   of   your

2                smoking.     Addiction to  nicotine is  not   controlling

3                your   behavior.      If   t hat' s  t he amount   you smoke,   you're

4                in control,   you're choosing to smoke.

5                          The second  point   is:     It   shows  that   there  had to

6                be something to smoking besides  nicotine that

7                Mr.   Wilis  I i ked.     And it's  not   a cont r over si al   poi nt.

8                I'm sure he liked cigarette smoking.

9                           But   in t hi s case,   once t he  PI ai nt i f f s wer e done

10                preparing  hi rn   he couldn't   even adnri t   that   he  liked

11                smoking.     As  you  heard fromlvV.   Gofer,   he changed  his

12                testimony to say:     I   never   liked smoking.     The only

13                reason  I   smoked was t o avoi d  ni cot i ne wi t hdrawal .

14               That's  his  testimony  in  here,   that   throughout   his  life

15                for   30  more years  of   smoking,   he  never   liked smoking.

16                That' s  how f ar   he' s wi I I i ng to go to  hel p hi s  case

17                here.

18                           Now,   let's just   take a ni nut e to think about   what

19                the experimentation phase  really  means for   M.   Wilis

20                i n t hi s  case.     Well   before  Plaintiff's experts  claim

21                he's  addicted,   well   before  Plaintiff's experts  claim

22                that   he  had  lost   control   of   himself,   that   he no longer

23                had the ability to control   his  behavior,   think about

24               what   M.   Wilis  knew about   cigarettes.

25                           Fie  had started smoking at   five,   he got   the 1481

1                occasional   cigarette from other   people when  he was  in

2                the children's  home,   and well   before --   according to

3                Plaintiff's  experts  --   lost   control   of   himself,   he

4                knew how ci gar et t es tasted,   he knew t he effects of

5                snroki ng,   he knew what   i t   was  I i ke to go wi t hout

6                cigarettes,   he knew t hat   smoking was  bad for   hi rn   and

7                he knew t hat   people called cigarettes  "coffin tacks"

8                and "cancer   st i cks."

9                          And it's  only  after   all   of   this  experience and

10                al I   of   t hi s  personal   knowledge that   IW.   Wilis  makes

11                his decision to become a regular,   daily smoker.     Fie

12                had  been experimenting with cigarettes for   more than

13                t en years.

14                          By t he t i me he made his  choice to become a

15                regular   smoker,   he knew more about   cigarettes than

16               just   about   anyone  his  age.     Fie had  been experimenting

17               wi t h t hem si nee he was f i ve.     Fie knew what   t hey t ast ed

18                like,   he knew what   they did to hi na   and  most

19                i nrport ant I y,   he knew what   i t   was  I i ke to go wi t hout

20                t hem

21                           And wi t h al I   t hat   know! edge and al I   t hat

22                experience,   he decided to become a regular   smoker   when

23                he was  growing  up.     IWiybe  he's  16,   maybe  he's   17,

24                maybe he's   18.     The record  is  not   clear   on this.

25                           But   what   i s cl ear   is t hat   he had a I evel   of 1482

1                personal   awareness  and personal   experience that   is

2                unique.     Fie knew more about   cigarettes than just   about

3                anyone his  age when he made his  choice to start   buying

4                ci garet t es  and snroki ng on a dai I y basi s.

5                           Because he knew what   he was doi ng,   because he had

6                this  knowledge,   because he had this  experience,   it   is

7               the  Defendants'   position that   he is  responsible for

8                that   choice,   not   the  Defendants,   not   some executive in

9                North Carolina,   not   some factory worker   putting

10                cigarettes  in a box  in  Kentucky.     IW.   Wilis.

11                Mr.   W I I i s  i s  responsible for   the choice he made to

12                start   and continue smoking.

13                          And when you think about   these issues,   think

14                about   his  experimentation  phase because  IW.   Uterwyk

15                made a bi g deal   of   this during his  opening statement.

16                And  he  made it   clear   that   they're in control   during

17               this  experiment   phase.

18                          Wfel I ,   Mr.   W I I i s' s  experiment   phase was  more than

19                a decade long.     Fie had a couple cigarettes  here and a

20                couple cigarettes there,   but   his  experimentation phase

21                lasted a decade.     And it   was  only after   he went

22                through all   of   that   and demonstrated all   of   that

23                control,   all   of   that   abi I i t y t o control   his  behavior

24                and to control   his  use of   cigarettes that   he

25                started  --   he decided to start   buying and smoking 1483

1                cigarettes  on a regular   basis.

2                           I   mentioned this  earlier.     But   even though

3                Mr.   Wilis  smoked for   more than 30 years  and claims

4               t hat   he was  unabl e t o cont r ol   hi msel f ,   t her e was  never

5                anyt hi ng t hat   he I i ked about   snroki ng,   and  I'll   show

6                you,   if   we have it   --we don't   have it.

7                          We'I I   t al k about   it   later  when  IW.   Wilis  is  on

8                the stand,   and  I   prom'se you,   this  is the one t i me  I

9                get   to talk to you at   the beginning of   the case and

10                one  more t i me at   closing arguments.

11                           And so  make a note.      I   will   show you the

12                testimony where  he changed  his  original   sworn

13                statement   and it   now reads:     I   never   liked anything

14                about   smoking.     The only  reason  I   smoked was to avoid

15                ni cot i ne wi t hdr awal .

16                          You  heard  IW.   Uterwyk talk about   some of   the

17                Defendants'   conduct   over   the  last   60 years,   some of

18                the things  they  said,   some of   the things  they wrote,

19                but   you didn't   hear   anything connecting that   conduct

20                t o IW.   WI I i s  hi msel f .

21                           Plaintiffs  have to show,   as  you  heard from

22                IW .   Uterwyk,   that   IW .   W I I i s  rel i ed on something the

23                Defendants  did or   did  not   do about   smoking,   something

25                          And what   do  I   mean  by  "rel i ed on" ?    Wei I ,   i t' s 1484

1                more than  mere exposure.     It's  not   enough just   to see

2                something.     You  have to  rely  on  it,   and  it's  almost

3                like another   but-for   test,   and but-for,   quite frankly,

4                is a conrpl i cat ed standard.

5                          So  I   have an exanrpl e t hat   wi I I   hopef ul I y  make i t

6                a little easier.     Che way to get   to Bradenton is to

7                come down  Ftout e 41   and go over   what   I   t hi nk  used to be

8                called The Green  Bridge.     Not   sure if   it's  The Green

9                Bridge anymore.      It's  right   out   that   window.     Cn one

10                si de i s  Palmetto,   one side is  Bradenton,   and i n t he

11                nl ddl e i s t he IVanat ee  Rver.

12                          Wei I ,   i n t hi s  case,   the  Defendants  are on one

13                side of   the  IVanat ee  Rver,   and  IW.   Wilis  is  on the

14                other   side.     And it   is  Plaintiff's  burden to build a

15                bridge between the two,   and it   has t o be a bridge of

16                facts.     It   can't   be a bridge of   guessing or

17                supposition or   assurrpt i ons,   and that's what   IW.

18                Uiterwyk's  chart   was.

19                           Remember,   he showed you the chart.     Fie said:

20                Well,   he smoked  Pall   IVal I   then and  it   was the  most

21                popular   brand ever.     And then  he smoked  Kool ,   and that

22               was  a popular   brand.     And then  he smoked  IVferlboro,   and

23                that   was  a popular   brand.     Those aren't   facts.     That's

24                not   a sufficient   bridge.     Those are just   guesses.

25                Just   assurrpt i ons. 1485

1                           I f   PI ai nt i f f   can't   build that   bridge,   they can't

2               wi n t hi s  case.     And when t hi s  case i s  over   I   wi I I   be

3                back to argue that   at   best   --

4                          IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Your   Honor,   he's  actually  arguing

5               what   he's  going to argue.

6                          THE COURT:     Cverrul ed.

7                          IVR.   BOYCE:     Hold t hem t o that   burden to build

8                that   bridge.     IVfeke sure it's  a bridge of   facts  because

9               when this  case is  over   I   will   come back and argue to

10                you that   at   best   they  built   one of   those infamous

11                bridges to nowhere,   because they don't   have the facts

12                to meet   their   burden.

13                          And you  heard  it   from M-.   Uiterwyk.     Can  I

14                connect   an advertisement   t o IW.   Wilis?    No,   that's

15                f rom PI ai nt i f f s,   that's  not   from me.     Let's just   look

16                at   IW.   Wilis'   own testimony  on this.     And,   again,

17               your   testimony was  that   you didn't   ever   buy  a

18                cigarette because of   any of   these advertisements?

19                Answer:     Not   that   I   remember.     Thi s  i s  IW.   Wilis'

20                case.     Fie's  got   the burden of   proof.

21                           11' s  not   enough to say  I   don't   remember   and then

22                have your   lawyer   fill   i n t he gaps.     And there's

23                nothing wrong with  being the type of   person who smokes

24                because they  like it.     Not   everyone is  influenced  by

25                advertising or   public  statements,   and  here there will 1486

1                be evidence that   IW.   Wilis  never   even saw t hem,   let

2                alone relied on them--   this  but-for   test,   that

3                but-for   something the  Defendants  did,   he  never   would

4                have smoked and  never   gotten sick.     This  evidence is

5                not   i n t hi s  case,   and if   he di dn' t   even see it,   it's

6                i rrpossi bl e for   t hem t o  meet   their   burden.

7                          Let's  look at   this  evidence two different   ways.

8                On t he one  hand,   let's  look and see if   anything the

9                Defendants did affected what   IW.   Wilis  knew about   the

10                risks  of   smoking.     And then on the other   hand,   we'll

11                look at   what   IW.   Wilis  actually  knew,   his  actual

12                personal   awareness.     And  I'll   give you an exanrpl e.

13                You  heard about   the  Frank statement.     IVr.   Uiterwyk  put

14                i t   up on the board,   it   was  a statement   issued by the

15                tobacco conrpani es  back  in  1954.

16                           I   just   want   to make one point.      Ftemenrber   they

17                showed the picture of   the  Plaza Hot el   and there was  a

18                secret   meeting and all   the executives were there and

19                they  locked arms?    You  know what   IVr.   Uterwyk didn't

20                tell   you?    The tobacco conrpany  invited the government

21                to attend that   meeting.     How secret   could that   meeting

22                have been  if   they  invited the government   to attend?

23                          The t obacco conrpani es  cal I ed t he publ i c  heal t h

24                authorities,   they called the government,   and said,

25                come with us,   we would  like to talk about   these 1487

1                issues.     Now,   the government   didn't   go,   but   it   was  not

2                a secret   meeting.     Nonetheless,   the  Frank statement

3                came out,   and it   was  published.     But   IVt.   Wilis  never

4                saw it.     No one in  hi s  f anri I y  ever   saw i t.     None of

5                his friends  or   colleagues  even saw t he Frank

6                st at ement.     11' s  i nrpossi bl e to be af f ect ed by a

7                statement   that   you  never   see,   but,   again,   I   want   you

8                to remerrber   as this case goes  on,   that   there's  a world

9                of   difference between exposure and  reliance.

10                           Ftel i ance i s t he green bridge,   the bridge of   facts

11                t hat   PI ai nt i f f s  have to build in this  case.     Exposure

12                i s,   I   remerrber   the  IVkrlboro IVan.     There's  a world of

13                difference,   and  Plaintiffs  are going to try to prove

14               their   case through assurrpt i ons and guesses  and

15                supposition,   and it's  not   good enough.

16                           Now,   you  heard that   at   one time the  Defendants

17               debated the risk of   smoking,   and  I   want   to make one

18                point   here.     That   debate is  long gone.     Both  Reynolds

19                and  Phi I i p Mor r i s  adni t   t hat   snroki ng causes  a var i et y

20                of   serious diseases,   nicotine is  addictive,   and

21                smoking will   shorten your   life;   it   is that   simple.

22                Ther e wi I I   be no di sput e about   t hose f act s  in t hi s

23                case,   but   what's  clear   is  that   smokers  have known

24                about   the  risk of   smoking and the difficulty of

25                quitting for   decades  in this  country. 1488

1                           The evi dence wi I I   be t hat   you woul d  have had t o

2                live under   a rock  not   to know t hat   smoking was  bad for

3                you or   hard to quit   back i n t he '50s.     And  M-.   Wilis

4               didn't   live under   a rock,   he knew t hi s.     And knowing

5                t hi s,   he st i I I   made hi s  choi ce to st art   and cont i nue

6                snroki ng.

7                          So  I et' s t ur n t o t he other   side of   the coin.

8                Wiat   di d  Mr.   Wilis  actually  know about   the  risks  of

9                smoki ng?    Wo have a t i me I i ne her e t hat' s a little

10                hard to see,   so  I ' I I   walk through it   with you.     But

11                you can see that   in  1946 IW.   Wilis  hides  behind a

12                haystack to smoke his first   cigarette.     Fie hears

13                people call   them coffin tacks  and cancer   sticks.

14                          Somewhere towards  the  late '50s,   he begins

15                smoking one pack every ten days,   and that's  the  1957

16                era t here.     And t hi s  is when  he' s somet i mes  cal I ed a

17                chipper,   social   smoker   or   a chipper.      It's  someone who

18                smokes  one or   two cigarettes  a day,   and,   again,

19                plaintiff's  experts will   concede that   that   type of

20                person  is  in conrpl et e control   of   their   behavior.

21                           M".   W I I i s  begi ns  snroki ng one pack a day

24               t here t hat   f rom 1961   to  1967,   t he Ai r   Force Ti mes,

25               whi ch i s  a magazine that   t he Ai r   Force publishes  --1489

1                t he A r   Force Times  had frequent   treatments  of   the

2                risk of   smoking and the difficulties  of   quitting.

3                           In  1964 --   this  is just   a couple years  after   he

4                started smoking  regularly  --   the  landmark  U.S.   Surgeon

5                General's  report   on smoking came out.      It   was  the very

6                first   report,   and  it   was front   page  news  everywhere.

7               And  it   concluded that   smoking caused  lung cancer.

8                That' s   1964.

9                          And in  1966,   the first   warning  label   went   on the

10                side of   the pack:     Caution,   cigarette smoking  may  be

11                hazardous  to your   health.     And we have the entries  in

12                there for   t he t i me periods  that   he's  living with  IVts.

13                Rouse and  reflects,   again,   this  personal   knowledge of

14               the  risk of   smoking that   he had  by telling  IVts.   Rouse

15                that   she shouldn't   smoke and it's  not   good for   her.

16                           I n t he early  '80s,   M".   Wilis  quit   smoking

17                Reynolds'   brands,   and  in  1993  M.   Wilis  quit   smoking

18                per manent I y.

19                          There is  a button on this that   I   was  not   to

20                touch.     I   appeared to have touched it.     I   told t hem I

21                would  hit   it.     There we go.

22                          These are the warning  labels that   have appeared

23                on the cigarette packs  over   the years.     The first   one

24                i s  on t he t op I ef t ,   t hat   cigarette smoking  may  be

25                hazardous  to your   health.      In  1970 it   changed,   and 1490

1                t hat' s  t he one on the top right   that   the Surgeon

2                General   has deter rrined that   cigarette smoking is

3                dangerous  to your   health.

4                          And then in  1984/1985.     They went   to the full

5               warnings that   you see on the bot t om of   that   chart,   and

6                they  rotate.     One says that   it   causes  lung cancer,

7                heart   disease,   errphysema and  may complicate pregnancy.

8                One explains  that   it's  not   something  pregnant   women

9                should do.     One notes that   cigarette smoke contains

10                carbon  monoxide.     And the one on the bottom right

11                reflects that   quitting cigarette smoking  now greatly

12                reduces  serious  risks  to your   health.

13                           Now,   in this  case,   as  you saw from the worksheet,

14                IW .   W I I i s  cl ai ms that   he smoked three packs of

15                cigarettes  a day for   almost   30 years.     Three packs  a

16                day for   almost   30 years.      If   you think about   that,

17                between  1966 and  1993,   because the warnings were on

18                the side of   the pack,   IW.   Wilis was warned  more than

19                500,000 times  about   the  risks  of   smoking.

20                           I   di d a I i 111 e numbers chart   so that   we could

21                walk through this  together.     There's  365 days  in a

22                year,   and if   you believe t hem,   that   he's  smoking three

23                packs  a day,   that's  1,095 packs  a year.     There's

24                27 year s  bet ween t he first   war ni ng  I abel   i n  1966 and

25                t he t i me he qui t   i n  1993,   and t hat' s  a t ot al   of   29, 565 1491

1                total   packs.     And since there's  20 cigarettes  in a

2                box,   each t i me he goes for   a cigarette pack,   there's

3                20 i n a pack,   he goes to each pack 20 ti mes,   he was

4               warned 591,300 t i mes.

5                          Almost   600,000 times  the  Defendants  in this  case

6               warned  IW.   Wilis  about   the risk of   smoking.      It   says

7                bad for   your   health,   it   causes  cancer,   quit   now,   it's

8                good for   you.     Almost   600,000 warnings.     Every t i me  he

9                saw t hat   warning,   he could  have decided to make that

10                last   cigarette his very  last   one,   but   he didn't.     Fie

11                kept   smoking.     Fie smoked all   the way  up until    1993,

12                and t hen  he qui t.

13                          And you  know how he qui t   in  1993?    Fie qui t   col d

14               turkey.     And they want   to contend there are these

15                various  shots and painkillers  i n t he hospital,   and

16                t hat' s  t he onl y  reason  he quit.     But   you  know what' s

17               funny?    Fie said  he  never   even felt   the urge to smoke

18                afterwards,   never   even felt   the urge.

19                          Ve  heard duri ng j ury  sel ect i on  how many f or mer

20                smokers  there were say,   I   feel   the urge to this day;

21                t hat' s  not   rvt.   Wilis.     Wien  he quit   in  1993,   he  has

22                not   had a si ngl e ci gar et t e in t he I ast   17 year s,   and

23                more inrportantly  he's  never   even felt   the urge.

24                          That's  the type of   individual   who is  able to

25                cont r ol   his  behavi or.     That' s  the t ype of   i ndi vi dual 1492

1                who is  not   being controlled by addiction to nicotine.

2                Fie's  i n control,   and  because  he's  in control   it's

3                appropriate to conclude that   he is  making a choice to

4                smoke.     And  here it   i s  t he  Defendants'   position that

5                he should  not   be rewarded for   the choices  he made.

6                The  Plaintiffs want   you to excuse him from

7                responsibility  on one  hand and on the other   hand they

8               want   you to  reward  hi m wi t h  money.     Fie knew what   he

9               was  doi ng and  he was  i n control .

10                           Now,   we' ve sai d a f ew t i nes t hat   the first

11                warning  label   went   on the pack in  1966,   and  I   think

12                sonet i nes  it's  hard t o  remember   j ust   how I ong ago  1966

13                really was.     But   in  1966 Lyndon Johnson was  president,

14               the Vi et nam war   was still   going on.     It's actually

15                three years  before  man walked on the  moon.     Three

16                years  before man walked on the moon,   the  Defendants

17                started warning  M.   Wilis  about   the  risks  of   smoking

18                on every pack of   cigarettes  he had.

19                           In fact,   the first   Super   Bowl   wasn't   until    1967.

20                In  1967,   a year   after   the warning  labels went   on,   that

21                was the first   t i me t he hand- hel d calculator   was

22                invented,   except   it   cost   $2,500 and weighed several

23                pounds.      1966 was  a long,   long tine ago,   and 44 years

24                i s  a I ot   of   war ni ngs.

25                          There should  be  no doubt   that   M".   Wilis  knew t he 1493

1                risks of   smoking,   had control   of   his  behavior,   and

2                made a choi ce t o smoke.     Now,   we know M .   Wilis  - -

3                           I   should tell   you if   you ever   need a break,

4                please just   raise your   hand and we can stop.     I   should

5                al so I et   you know I ' m act ual I y comf or t abl e in  her e so

6                I   know i t   nest   be an icebox.     Laurie is  kind enough to

7                keep it   col d whi I e  I   was goi ng to t al k to you.

8                           Now,   we know M .   Wilis  saw t he f i r st   war ni ng

9                label   and paid attention to it   because that's the

10                first   time  he quit   smoking.     We've  heard a I ot   of

11                people talk about   trying to quit,   and quite frankly  I

12                don't   know what   that   means.     You either   smoke or   you

13                don't.     You can quit   for   an  hour,   you can quit   for   a

14               day,   you can quit   for   a week.      I   don't   know what   tried

15                to quit   means.     You can quit   and start   smoking again,

16                and  I   understand that,   but   I ' m not   sure where this

17               quit   attempt   language cane from

18                           But   i n  1966 IW.   WI I i s qui t   smoking.     And  he did

19                so because of   the first   warning  label.     If   he had

20                stopped smoking  permanently at   that   time,   he would

21                have avoi ded al I   of   hi s  i nj ur i es.     No wi t ness  in t hi s

22                case wi I I   di sput e t hat   t he f i r st   ti rre M".   W I I i s  qui t

23                i n ' 66,   i f   he had followed through on that,   that   he

24               would have avoided  his throat   cancer   and that   he would

25                have avoi ded al I   t he ot her   di seases  in his  life,   but 1494

1                he went   back to smoki ng.

2                           Now,   he doesn't   remenrber   how I ong  he quit   smoking

3                f or   i n  1966.     Fie night   have quit   for   two or   three

4               days,   he night   have quit   for   a week.     But   the evidence

5                i n t hi s  case wi I I   be t hat   ni cot i ne i s  out   of   your

6                syst em i n two or   three days.      If   you quit   for   two or

7               three days,   nicotine is  gone from your   body.     And  if

8                you go back to smoking after   that,   it's  not   because of

9                ni cot i ne.     Sonet hi ng el se is  goi ng on.

10                           Fie liked smoking;   that's what's  going on  here.

11                But   when he got   to this  case,   when  he filed this

12                lawsuit   in 2007 for   money,   under   oath  he  never   liked

13                anything about   smoking;   that's  his  testimony  here.     Fie

14                never   liked anything about   smoking.

15                           Now,   M".   Wilis  does  not   recall   rruch about   the

16                times that   he claims  he quit   smoking over   the years.

17                But   he di d t est i f y t hat   f r om 1966 or   ' 67 unt i I   some

18                t i me i n t he  1980's,   that   all   he di d t o quit   was  leave

19                his  cigarettes  i n  hi s  car   when  he went   to work;   and

20                you  heard this  fromlvV.   Uterwyk this  morning.

21                           And  I   just   want   to  make two points  about   that:

22                Wien you go to work an ei ght - hour   shift   and you  leave

23                your   cigarettes  i n t he car,   you're in control   of   your

24                behavior.      If   you can go eight   hours without

25                cigarettes,   nicotine is  not   causing you to smoke.     You 1495

1                are not   addicted such that   you're unable to control

2                your   behavior,   you're in control.      If   you can  leave

3                t hem i n the car   --   we can judge whether   that's  a

4                sufficient   way t o qui t   --   but   at   a ni ni rrum i t   shows

5                that   M".   Wilis was  able to control   his  behavior   when

6                he wanted to.     And  he proved that   by  leaving  his

7                ci garet t es  in hi s  car   f or   basi cal I y  hal f   t he day.

8                           Beyond t hat,   I   t hi nk  i t   says  sonnet hi ng about

9               whether   he was  motivated to quit.     Ask yourselves,   for

10                any  other   personal   behavior,   is  that   sufficient

11                motivation?    If   you  had a friend who was  out   of   work

12                i n  1966 and  he t ol d you,   al I    I   want   is  a j ob.     And you

13                met   up wi t h  hi m agai n  i n  1993 and  he st i I I   di dn' t   have

14                a j ob,   and  he sai d,   you know what,   I   want   a j ob more

15                than anything.     You'd go,   what   did you do?    Well,

16                t here were t wo or   t hree days  back i n  ' 66 where  I

17                I ooked f or   a j ob,   and t her e wer e a coupl e ot her   t i noes

4                          Now,   we t al ked a little bi t   about   addi ct i on and

5                t er ni nol ogy and  habi t   i n what   you cal I   ci gar et t es,   and

6                IVr.   Cof er   explained how there used t o be a scientific

7               definition for   addiction,   and then the Surgeon  General

8                el i rri nat ed a f ew of   t hose el ement s  and concl uded t hat

9                ni cot i ne was  i ndeed addi ct i ve in  1988.

10                           But   the  label   is  not   inrportant;   it's just

11                something that   we cal I   a personal   behavior.     Wiet her

12                you call   it   habit   or   dependence or   addiction,   it's  not

13               what's  inrportant   in this  case.     Wiat' s  inrportant   in

14               t hi s  case i s who i s  i n cont rol ,   and you' I I   hear   t hi s

15                from Dr.   Benowitz.     Dr.   Benowi t z testified that

16               whether   you  use the t er m addi ct i on,   habituation,

17               dependence,   the real   issue i s t he control   that   people

18                have over   their   behavior,   and that's what   Dr.   Benowitz

19               wi I I   say  in t hi s  case.     The i ssue i s  cont rol ,   not   what

20                you cal I   it.

21                           You'll   also see this  from the Surgeon  General.

22                Wiet her   you cal I   it   addi ct i on or   habi t,   dependence,   i t

23                doesn't   matter,   it's  a personal   behavior,   and people

24                have the ability to control   their   behavior   if   they're

25                sufficiently  motivated.     And so as this  case goes  on, 1497

1                I   ask you to keep that   i n  ni nd,   to think about   whether

2                IW.WIIisisin control   of   his  behavior   or   whether

3                he's  out   of   control.      Is  nicotine causing  hi m t o

4                smoke?    Because if   IVr.   Wilis was  in control,   if   he

5               was  abl e to cont rol   his  behavi or,   t hen  PI ai nt i f f s

6                can't   win their   case,   they can't   prove that   addiction

7                caused  hi m t o smoke.     Plaintiffs  can't   win;   i t' s  t hat

8                si nrpl e.

9                          So as you go through this case,   think about   these

10                issues  and think about   what   you would expect   somebody

11                t o do i f   they were sufficiently  motivated and conrpare

12                t hat   t o what   the facts  show for   IVr.   Wilis.

13                           Now,   we t al ked a little bi t   about   how bad

14                cigarettes  are for   you and  IVr.   Uiterwyk's  opening

15                statement   was  really an attack on the  Defendants  and

16                cigarettes  in general,   but   I   just   want   to spend a

17                couple  ni nut es  to talk about   some of   the things you

18                did  not   hear   fromM'.   Uiterwyk,   some of   the things  the

19                Defendants  have done over   the years to reduce the

20                risks  of   smoking that   you didn't   hear   fromM'.

21                Uiterwyk.

22                          And we  have a chart   that   goes  through some of

23                these,   but,   first,   Defendants did not   dispute that

24                cigarettes  are bad for   you.     Anytime you  burn organic

25                material   and  inhale it,   you're doing something  bad to 1498

1                your   body.     But   what   the  Defendants  have tried to do

2                over   the years  is  reduce those risks.

3                           Fi rst   t hey  put   a f i I t er   on  it.     Next   t hey

4                invented reconstituted tobacco.     Then they expanded

5                t obacco.     And t he goal   of   bot h of   t hose i s  i f   you can

6                get   I ess t obacco i n a ci garet t e,   t hey' I I   be I ess

7                smoke,   less  tar.     So everyone knows  that   the bad stuff

8                in cigarettes  i s  i n t he t ar.      11' s  not   nicotine.     You

9                saw t hat   one document   t hat   sai d  ni cot i ne i s  a poi son;

10               what   that   actually  means  is  in its  pure form nicotine

11                is a poison.     They actually use it   as  an insecticide,

12                but   it   doesn't   cause cancer,   it's  not   what   they worry

13                about   when they think about   the  risks  of   smoking.

14                Nicotine in smoke,   other   than the effects  it   has  on

15                the smoker,   doesn't   cause cancer.     The stuff   that's

16                bad in cigarettes  is  in the tar   part   of   it.

17                          So t he  Defendants  tried to  reduce the tar.     They

18                reduced the ci r currf er ence,   they  puffed up the tobacco,

19                they added filters,   they  made more porous  paper   and

20                faster   burning  paper,   and they  put   ventilation  holes

21                on t he f i I t er,   al I   i n an effort   to  reduce the amount

22                of   tar   and  nicotine that   the smoker   would get,   and

23                they were successful.     They  reduced those levels  by

24                more than 60 percent.     The tobacco conrpani es did this.

25                          They went   further.     You'll   hear   evidence from the 1499

1                witnesses  in this  case that   R. J.   Reynolds developed

2                revolutionary  new products  that   don't   even  burn

3                tobacco.     One is called  Prenier   and one is  called

4                Eclipse,   and what   they tried to do there was just   heat

5                the tobacco.      It's  this  burning of   organic  material

6                that   creates the bad stuff   in smoke,   and you'll   learn

7                all   about   this  chenistry and  more than you  probably

8                ever   wanted to know about   how i t   works.

9                          And some of   it   i s  ki nd of   interesting and  neat,

10                but   basi cal I y every t i me you  have i nconrpl et e

11                combustion of   organic  material,   you  result   --   the

12                result   is  some weird cherri cal   corrpounds,   and they're

13                bad.     They  cause cancer,   and they're  nasty.     And

14               that's what   the  Defendants  are trying to get   out   of

15                the smoke.     That's why they add filters,   that's why

16                there's  reconstituted tobacco,   that's why there's

17                expanded tobacco,   and that's why  Reynolds  eventually

18                developed cigarettes that   don't   even burn tobacco.

19                They  have a little heating element   on the end of   it,

20                and t hey' r e  nruch di f f er ent   t han a t r adi t i onal

21                cigarette.     They spent   a tremendous  amount   of   money to

22                devel op t hat .     Phi I i p Mor r i s  devel oped a pr oduct

23                t hat' s  cal I ed Accord t hat' s al ong t he same I i nes.

24                          The Defendants also developed and marketed

25                products that   have basically  no  nicotine.     The  levels 1500

1                are so I ow t hat   you almost   can't   measure t hern   ultra

2                I ow t hi s  and  ultra I ow t hat,   but   M.   Wilis  never

3                smoked any  of   these brands.     Fie  never   went   to an  ultra

4                I ow-1 ar   brand or   tried a Prenier   or   an  Eclipse,   and

5                t hat' s  anot her   choi ce t hat   he made.

6                           11' s  not   t he  Defendants'   fault   that   M.   Wilis

7               wasn't   interested in going to a product   with reduced

8                risk;   it's  a choice he  made.      It's  not   the  Defendants'

9                f aul t   t hat   he wasn' t   i nt er est ed in this  st uf f.

10                           Now,   Reynolds  does  not   add  nicotine to its

11                cigarette,   none.     In fact,   nicotine is actually

12                removed f r om ci gar et t es  during the  manufacturing

13                process.     They  have to take nicotine out   of   tobacco.

14               And you  heard  IW.   Uterwyk talk about   controlling the

15                ni cot i ne and  mani pul at i ng t he  ni cot i ne.     A I ot   of

16                those allegations  come from the reconstituted tobacco

17                process.

18                          One of   the problems with  making cigarettes  is

19                that   tobacco is  an agricultural   product,   and nicotine

20                i s  i n i t   nat ural I y.      It   gets  absorbed  into the plant

21                f rom t he soi I   whi I e i t' s  growi ng.     So when  Reynol ds

22                goes  and gets tobacco,   nicotine is  already  in there.

23                But   i t' s  not   the same amount   in every  crop of   tobacco

24               t hey get.     They  have t o - -   j ust   I i ke Coke want s t o

25                have the same amount   of   sugar   i n each can --   in order

1                to ensure a consistent   product,   Fteynol ds  has to

2                control   these levels,   so they take nicotine out   and

3                they  make sure that   i t' s t he same in each cigarette.

7                IVbrris were alone in these efforts,   but   they weren't.

8                For   a decade or   more  Fteynol ds  and  Phi I i p IVbrri s worked

10                hand-in-hand to develop a cigarette with  reduced  risk.

11                It   was  called the National   Cancer   Institute Tobacco

12                W)rki ng  Group.

13                           For   ten years  the government,   the National   Cancer

14                Institute,   and the  Defendants  in this  case worked

15                together   to come up with the reduced-risk cigarette.

16                And as   I   mentioned earlier,   Reynolds  didn't   stop

17               there.     They went   on to develop  Prenier   and  Eclipse,

18                and all   kinds of   alternative products that   you'll   hear

19                about   in this case.     But   I   just   want   to take one

20                ni nut e t o point   out   that   there is  no safe cigarette.

21                Nothing they can do can  make a cigarette safe,   but

22                that   doesn't   mean the  Defendants  stopped trying.

23                          Your   Honor,   I   have one more topic,   I   wonder   if   we

11                anytime that   you think we need to take a break,   by all

12                means  I et   me know.

13                           M.   Boyce,   you  may  continue.

14                          IvR   BOYCE:     Thank you,   Your   Honor.

15                           I've got   good  news,   ladies  and gentlemen,   I   went

16                back through  my  notes  during the break and just   one

17                more topic,   I'll   have you out   of   here by  7:00.

18                          All   right.     We'll   go for   4:15.      I   j ust   wanted to

19                make sure you were st i I I   I i st eni ng.

20                           I   mentioned before that   there were two issues

21                that   I   wanted to talk about,   and that's the last   topic

22                that   I   have for   you,   and that's what   happens to your

23                body when you quit   smoking.     As we've talked about,

24               there are bad things  in cigarettes,   and when you

25                smoke,   they do bad things  to your   body. 1504

1                           But   t he evi dence in t hi s  case wi I I   be undi sput ed

2                that   the ni nut e you quit   smoking,   the very  rri nut e you

3                stop,   your   body  begins to repair   itself   and to reverse

4               t he damage t hat' s done by snroki ng.     And t hi s  is cal I ed

5                decl i ni ng  ri sk.     And t hi s  is  t he poi nt   t hat' s

6                reflected  in that   one Surgeon  General's warning that

7               we looked at:     That   quitting smoking  now greatly

8                reduces  serious  risk to your   health.     Your   body will

9                repair   itself   over   time and if   you quit   for   long

10                enough,   your   risks  for   getting snroki ng- r el at ed

11                diseases come down very steeply.     They get   almost   to

12                the point   where it's  as  if   you never   smoked at   all;

13               where if   you quit   for   long enough,   you get   your   risk

14               down t o t he point   where you  never   almost   smoked at

15                    al I .

16                           Now,   as  you  heard earlier,   neither   Fteynol ds  or

17                Philip Morris contests that   ci garet t e-smoki ng causes

18                bladder   cancer.     In fact,   if   you smoke,   the evidence

19                i s t hat   you' re t wo or   t hree t i mes  more I i kel y to get

20                bladder   cancer   than a nonsnroker   --   about   two or   three

21                more t i mes.

22                           But   there's  also  no dispute that   once you stop

23                smoking,   your   risk for   getting a smoki ng-rel at ed

24                bladder   cancer   disease.     And  here the evidence is that

25                M'.   Wilis  stopped smoking  in  1993.     Ten years  later, 1505

1                he developed bladder   cancer.     Now,   during those ten

2                years that   he did  not   smoke a single cigarette,   his

3                risk of   bladder   cancer   went   down.     And  I   have a chart

4                here t hat   ref I ect sit.

5                           But   as  you can see on t he I ef t   in  1993 as  a

6                smoker   he's  two or   three more times  likely,   so  I

7                st art ed  my  I i ne a I i 111 e over   2.5 and you'll   hear

8                testimony about   various  numbers,   relative risk,   and

9                that   sort   of   thing.     But   basically,   it's  undisputed

10                that   by t he t i me he gets to 2003,   his  risk is  under

11                1.5.      It's  probably somewhere around  1.4,   somewhere in

12                there,   but   it's  not   an exact   science.

13                           But   one thing  I   want   to point   out   about   this

14                chart   is when they do these studies,   no one knows  for

15                sure  how cancer   starts.     They  call   that   the  mechanism

16                No one knows  for   certain the  mechani sm of   causing

17                cancer.     So what   they do,   when they try to deter nine

18                the  risks  of   smoking  is  they do a mass  study,   an

19                epi deni ol ogi cal   study.

20                          And they take one group of   smokers  and one group

21                of   nonsnroker s,   and they try to make t he t wo groups  as

Page 37

22                identical   as  they  can,   so that   the only difference

23                between the two is that   one group smokes.     And if   they

24                observe a disease or   a response i n t he group they can

25                concl ude i t   comes  f rom smoki ng.     And t hat's  the way 1506

1                epi deni ol ogy wor ks,   and it's  a f i ne and f ai r   sci ence.

2                           But   when they do these studies  everyone comes  in

3               wi t h a baseline risk.     Nonsnrokers get   lung cancer,

4                nonsnrokers  get   bladder   cancer,   nonsnrokers get   throat

5                cancer.     And so when they do an epi deni ol ogi cal   study,

6                they sort   of   set   up 1.0 as  a baseline risk.     It's  a

7                r i sk t hat   has  not hi ng to do wi t h smoki ng.      11' s  a r i sk

8                that   we're all   born with.     As   I   said,   nonsnrokers  get

9                t hese di seases,   t oo.

10                          And as  you can see,   that   in 2003,   after   ten years

11                of   nonsmoking,   IW.   W I I i s's  r i sk f or   developing

12                bladder   cancer   had declined to where hi s t ot al   risk

13               was  about   1.4,   somewhere in that   range.     But   the  1.0

14                has  nothing to do with smoking.

15                           H s  excess  r i sk,   t hat' s  a t er m you' I I   I ear n  more

16                about   as this case goes  on.     Hs  excess  risk,

17                attributable to smoking,   is  under   1.0.      It's  probably

18                0.4,   0.5.     So  I   just   want   you to think about   this  as

19                this  case goes  on.     That   if   your   total   risk  is   1.4,

20                but   only 0.4 of   that   is  attributable to smoking,   think

21                about   the scales again.     I   won't   do my airplane;   I

22                know t hey don't   I i ke  my  airplane,   but   I   don't   do the

23                ai r pi ane.

24                          But   let's just   think about   that.      1.0,   that   has

25                not hi ng to do wi t h smoki ng,   i s  bi gger   t han 0. 4.     That 1507

1                i s st i I I   residual   excess  risk attributable t o hi s

2                former   smoking.     But   i n t hi s  case,   the standard is

3                more  likely than  not.     That's  the burden of   proof.

4                          And when you  look at   where  his  risk was for

5                bladder   cancer   in 2003,   what's  more  likely?    The  1.0

6                t hat' s  bi gger,   or   t he 0. 41?

7                          No one is  going to contend that   smoking doesn't

8                play a role in causing bladder   cancer,   but   he didn't

9                get   bladder   cancer   when  he was smoking;   he got   it   ten

10                years af t er   t he f act.

11                           Hs  risk for   getting  bladder   cancer   from smoking

12                declined during that   entire ten-year   period,   but

13               what's  interesting  is  there are other   risks  for

14                getting  bladder   cancer.     And as  you  heard from

15                IW.   Oof er   - -   you can see there's  the  (inaudible).      I

16                nrust   confess  I   was  surprised to see that.     That   was

17                kind of   neat,   but   I   didn't   know t hat   was  going to

18                happen.     But   that's just   the point   I   was just   talking

19                about.     The excess  risk is  smaller   than the baseline

20                r i sk by t he t i me he gets to  1.0.

21                           But   during those ten years,   IW.   Wilis  got   older.

22                The si rrpl e fact   i s t he group that   gets  bladder   cancer

23                more than anyone is white  men over   50.     That   group

24                accounts for   the largest   percentage of   bladder   cancer,

25               whi t e men over   50.     IW.   Wilis  has  al ways  been a whi t e 1508

1                man.     That   didn't   change in those ten years.     But   his

2                age went   up.

3                          So  his  risk for   smoking  is  going down,   but   his

4                risk for   getting older   is  going  up.     And that's why

5                t hat   1. 0,   t hat   ri sk  has  not hi ng to do wi t h smoki ng.

6                Bigger   than the 0.4 that's  left   over   from his  last

9                          And you'll   actually  hear   that   his  risk for

10                getting bladder   cancer   for   reasons that   have nothing

11                t o do wi t h smoking  is  actually  higher   than  1.0.

12                           But   I   wanted to take a ni nut e to explain a little

13                bit   about   epi deni ol ogy to you,   and preview some of   the

1                Wiat   this  case is  about   is whether   you're going to

2                absolve hi m of   responsibility for   his decision to

3                smoke,   and whether   you're going to  reward  hi m f or   his

5                          Wiet her   that   choice was  right,   or   whether   that

6                choice was wrong is  not   what   this case is about.     No

7                one disputes  the consequences  of   that   choice.     But

8               whether   you agree wi t h i t   or   disagree with it   is  not

9               what   t hi s  case i s  about .     Thi s case i s about

10                responsibility,   personal   responsibility for   the

12                          We al I   have the freedom to choose to engage in

13                risky  behaviors  in this  country,   but   the price of   that

14               freedom is  responsibility,   and that's what   this case

15                is about.

18                smoke?

19                          The plaintiffs want   you to second-guess

20                M.   Wilis's  lawsuit   --   M-.   Wllis's  decision.      It's

21                really just   that   si rrpl e.     They want   you to come in as

22                a jury after   the fact   and second-guess the choices

23                that   M-.   Wilis  made.     It's that   si rrpl e.

24                           I   know we t al ked a little bi t   dur i ng j ury

2                issues   I   was  trying to get   to.

3                          We couldn't   talk about   the case yesterday,   and so

4                I   t r i ed t o  make sure that   with the findings  in this

5                case,   with the defendants  being tobacco compani es,

6               wi t h t he personal   experience you all   have with smoking

7                and  knowing  people who smoke,   that   you could still   be

8                fair.     And each and every  one of   you  pronised to do

9                that.     And we all   feel   very good about   having you as

10               j urors.

11                           But   now I   t hi nk  - -   I   hope you' I I   under st and why

16                           But   it   was  your   answers  and your   cormri t rrent s  to

23                burden and that   the Defendants are entitled to a

25                          Thank you very  rruch,   ladies  and gentlemen. 1511

1                           THE COURT:     Ladies  and gentlemen,   I   told you that

2                your   par t i ci pat i on  in this  t r i al   as  a j ur or   woul d add

3                a very  unique patch t o t he qui I t   that   is  your   life.

4                11   wi I I   certainly  be interesting going forward.

5                           Now,   the obvious  inclination is  to  rush  home and

6                t o t al k t o your   loved ones  and f ani I y  menbers,   talk to

7               your   son who's  the  lawyer,   talk to your   f arri I y  menbers

8               who you  live with,   and to say:     W)w,   this  is  going to

9                be interesting because blah,   blah,   blah,   blah,   blah.

10                Or   this  is what   the openings were,   or   I   have a I ot   of

11                issues to decide over   t he - -   I ' m goi ng t o be hearing a

12                I ot,   i s t o begi n engagi ng in t hi s di al ogue.     11' s  a

13                natural   inclination;   I   can well   understand that.

14                           However,   I   have told you  repeatedly,   and  I   just

15                can't   enrphasi ze enough,   that   it   would be in violation

16                of   t he I aw t o have those conversations.

17                          A,   you're  not   per nit ted to begin the process  of

18                discussing even the opening arguments.

19                           B,   you' r e  not   per rri 11 ed to al I ow anyone t o

20                discuss with you the facts  or   their   opinions  regarding

21                facts  regarding tobacco conrpani es,   cigarette smoking,

22                heal t h-rel at ed illnesses,   et   cetera.

23                          So as difficult   as  it   is,   resist   the t errpt at i on

24               to have those conversations.     Ve are going to break

25                for   the day.     We're not   going to begin the testimony 1512

1                today.

2                           I   know i t' s  onl y  4: 15.      It's  been a f ai r I y  I ong

3               week.     You certainly  have worked  hard over   the  last

4                couple of   days  during the jury selection  process.     We

5                got   started  Monday  morning at   8:30 and  have been going

6                ever   since,   so it's  okay to break 45  rri nut es  early  on

7                Fr i day  af t er noon.

8                           Havi ng sai d t hat ,   we pr obabl y wi I I   wor k a little

9                bi t   I at er,   even after   4:15,   to resolve some of   the

10                issues  that   will   likely  come up early  in the trial

11                next   week.     So we' re  not   I eavi ng  ri ght   behi nd you,   but

12                hopef ul I y we won' t   be t oo,   t oo I at e t hi s  eveni ng.

13                           Do  not   do any  research on your   own,   do  not   go on

14               the  Internet,   do not   pick  up any  books  or   magazines  or

15                any  reports  about   any  of   these topics.      I   know t hat

16                t hat ,   t oo,   i s a natural   inclination.     We like to

17                educate ourselves  about   things that   we're going to

18                need to make decisions  about.     That's  our   natural

19                i ncl i nat i on.

20                           But   resist   that   t errpt at ion.     All   the evidence,   a

21                you the facts,   all   the evidence,   and  particularly  all

22                t he I aw t o make a wi se and t hought f ul   deci si on  has t o

23                come from this  court room and from this  courtroom

24                al one.

25                           I   t hi nk  I ' ve sai d i t   before,   but   resist   the 1513

3                received  no testimony,   or   at   any time during the

4                proceedings.     That   process  needs  t o wai t   until   you've

5                heard all   the evidence,   the argument   t o t he attorneys,

6                and the instructions  on the I aw gi ven  by  me.

7                           If   you  have been taking  notes,   they will   be

8                secured over   the weekend.     No one will   read your

9                notes.     No one wi I I   ever   read your   notes.     They wi I I

10                be destroyed after   the deliberations.

11                           I ' m goi ng t o ask you to  report   at   9:00  Ivbnday

12                morning.     You've got   your   parking pass,   so that's

13                f i ne.     We wi I I   I i kel y  st art   ear I i er   t han 9: 00  Monday

14                morning,   but   at   least   for   Monday  morning,   I ' m goi ng to

15                ask you t o  report   downs t ai rs  to t he j ury  hoi di ng  room

16                           It   may  be a little bit   crowded  Monday  because

17               we' r e br i ngi ng  nror e j ur or s  i n f or   ot her   t r i al s  t hat

18                start   next   week,   so just   be aware that   you won't   be

19                the only ones down there.     But   I   think you're a little

20                more comfortable down  here than  rri I I i ng around  up

21                here.      I ' m conf i dent   that   we can start   right   at   9:00,

22                but   I   was  confident   that   the selection process would

23                only take an  hour   or   two yesterday  and you could see

24               that   I   woefully  underestimated that.

25                          So  I ' m goi ng to  leave you downstairs  next   Monday 1514

1                at   9:00.     Hopefully  right   at   9:00,   I'll   send  my

2                bailiff   down;   he'll   escort   you upstairs.

4                          IVR.   UITERWYK:     No,   Your   Honor.     Thank you.

5                          THE COURT:     Anything else from the  Defendants?

6                           IvR   COFER:     No,   sir,   Your   Honor.

7                          THE COURT:     All   right.     Thank you,   ladies  and

8                gentlemen.     We appreciate your   continued cooperation.

9                Don' t   get   si ck over   t he weekend.     Don' t   engage i n any

10                hazardous  behavior   so that   you're not   here  IVbnday

11                morning.     We'll   see you  Monday  morning at   9:00.

12                           Leave those here.     They will   be secured.     Don't

13                take your   notepads  home.     They will   be i n a secure

14                location over   the weekend.

16                          THE COURT:     All   right.     The j ury  i s  secur e.      I

24                so --   that's  my  observation.      I   don't   want   to stay

15                           IVR   HUIVPHRI ES:     I   can't   say  so clearly.      I   was

16                trying to  look at   it   today.

17                          IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     But   we did,   so the answers  corrport

18               wi t h t he stipulation,   you  know,   there were a couple of

19                issues with,   and those answers  now corrport   with the

20                stipulation,   et   cetera.     So hopefully we're on the

21                same page,   but   you' II   I et   us  know.

3                but   if   there's  anything that   either   side thinks they

4               would like to have resolved before the weekend in

11                week ago,   I   think,   it   seems  I i ke a month ago --   and

12               went   through those,   we  resolved a number   of   them

13                However,   we still   have some issues that   need to be

14                resolved by the Court.

15                          We  have al so t he oncol ogi st   f r om t he VA hospi t al ,

16                Dr.   Mow! azadeh.     As you  recall,   he was taken very

17                late,   pr i or   t o t r i al ,   and  he's  been designated.     You

18                count erdesi gnat ed.     I   honestly  have not   had time to do

19                the objections  since  I've been busy  here i n t he

20                court room t hi s  last   week.      I   t hi nk t hat' s  not   quite

21                ready.

22                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Here would be rry  suggestion,   Your

23                Honor.     Wiy don't   you do the objections  to

24                Dr.   IVbwl azadeh over   the weekend?    I   know you  have got

25                plenty  of   t i me t hi s weekend.     And then we can address 1517

1                that   at   some point   during the break,   and  I'll   be t he

2                one to go through those with you.     We can  hopefully

3                hammer   t hem out .

4                          We do  have to deal   wi t h  Dr.   Wei nst ei n and there

5                are some objections to resolve wi t h t hat .     We do have

6                to address  some of   the exhibit   issues  related to

7                Dr.   Cunmri ngs,   but   I   understand  he's  coning on  IVbnday

8                afternoon or   Tuesday  --

9                           IVR.   Ul TERWYK:     No.     What   I   pi an on doi ng,   and

10               what   I ' m hopi ng to do --   obviously,   the best -1 ai d

11                plans  is to start   Dr.   Benowi t z on  IVbnday  morning and  I

12                actually think  he probably  can get   off   by  noon.

13                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Ckay.     Then  --

14                          IVR.   COFER:     Wt h  cross?

15                           IVR.   UITERWYK:     Yes.

16                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     I   think that   we should address  --

17                because what's  going to happen is we've got   the

18                exhibits for   Dr.   Cunmri ngs  and we're prepared to argue

19                any objections we have with regard to those exhibits.

20                Wfe can do t hose  now.

21                           THE COURT:     Ckay.

22                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Wfe got   Dr.   Benowi tz's  mat er i al s

23                late  last   night.      I   t hi nk  IVt.   Bigger   --   they were

25                argue those  now.     We'll   need to probably do that   first 1518

1                thing  Monday  morning,   but   I   t hi nk t he problem would  be

2                i s  i f   we have Benowi t z t o deal   wi t h  Ivbnday  nror ni ng and

3               we don't   deal   with  Cunrri ngs today,   then  both of   those

4                col I i de and t hat   may cause a I i 111 e bi t   of   a del ay.

5                So i t   probably  makes  sense to do that.     That   to me

6               would be the  most   urgent   thing.

7                          IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     I   wi I I   tell   you  Dr.   Wei nst ei n wi I I

9                           IVR.   JOHNSON:     I   wouldn't   say that   necessarily.

10                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     You think  it   could take  more than

11                a f ew ni nut es.

12                           IVR.   JOHNSON:      It   could.

13                           IVR.   COFER:     Chris  hasn't   been  i n t he courtroom

14                          IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Chris,   are you a betting person?

15                           IVR.   JOHNSON:     No,   I ' m not   a betting  person.

16                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     We'll   do i t   i n a hal f   an  hour   or

17                45 rri nut es.

18                          THE COURT:     So who's  f i r st ?

19                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:      Dr.   Benowi tz.

20                          THE COURT:     Benowi tz.     Ckay.     And then  Cunmi ngs.

21                Ckay.     Well,   I et' s  do Cunmi ngs.

22                           IVR.   BIGGER:     And  I   think there's  only  one,   I

23                mean,   one argument,   I   was  told --   maybe there's  more.

24               And there's  some things  that   need to be preserved for

25                t he  record. 1519

1                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     We  need to put   some issues  on the

2                record.     There is  an issue with  regard to a privilege

3                document   that   will   need to be addressed by the Court,

4                and we can address  that   all   right   now.

5                          THE COURT:     I   woul d  I i ke to get   as  nruch of

6                Cunmi ngs  problematic  issues  out   of   the way today  so

7               that   when we  meet   IVbnday  morning,   we're  left   with

8                Benowi t z.

9                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     And with  regard t o t he doctors,

10                Judge,   they're not   goi ng t o - -   I ' m not   going to use

11                any of   those depositions  probably until   Wednesday,

12                I'll   use one.     And  I   may  use one on Tuesday  and one

13                on --   I'm sorry  --   Wednesday.     One on Thursday,   one on

14                Friday,   but   I   can't   figure that   out   now.     And  I'm j ust

15                t hi nki ng when we' re goi ng to have t i me t o do - -   we' ve

16                also got   Dr.   Far one still   to do the first   part   of   next

17                week.

18                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     I   haven't   gotten any designations

19                from you for   Dr.   Farone yet.

20                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Dave,   you  know we  have t hem

21                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     No,   I   know t hat ,   but   I ' m j ust

22                saying  I   haven't   received your   designations.      If

23                you're using the second transcript   --   or   the second

24               trial   preservation.     So as  soon as  you get   those --

25                           MT.   Ul TERVWK:     Well,   the first   or   second doesn't 1520

1                matter.     Wiat   I ' m sayi ng i s t hat   i s  al so going to have

2                to have time.     And all    I'm trying to figure out,

3                Judge,   is  let's  assume we don't   get   squat   done on the

4               deposi t i ons  t hi s  af t er noon.     And  knowi ng t he way t hi s

5                goes  usually,   we probably won't,   because  I   don't   think

6                the Court   wants  t o st ay  I at e.      It's  Friday  afternoon,

7               we' ve had a I ong week.     Nunrber   one.

8                           Nunrber   two,   assuming that   we don't,   when do you

9                envision that   we're going to be able to do these four

10                deposition designations?

11                           THE COURT:     Wei I ,   what   I   woul d  I i ke to try to do

12                i s st ay about   two days  ahead of   the witness  actually

13                testifying.     So --   we're not   doing that   with  Benowitz.

14               We're probably  not   going to do his  until   IVbnday

15                mor ni ng,   but   we' re  not   abl e t o,   at   t hi s  poi nt,   f r om

16               what   I   understand.     But   nry  preference i s  t hat   we stay

17                about   two days  ahead.

18                          So  IVbnday  afternoon,   after   the testimony,   we wi I I

19                make sure that   at   least   all   the designations that   are

20                going to be problematic on Tuesday will   be taken care

21                of.     I f   we get   ahead --   you know,   if   we're okay with

22                Tuesday,   we'll   start   Wednesday's.     Does  that   make

23                sense?    I   would  like to stay a couple of   days  ahead of

24               the next   witness that's  intended to be called.

25                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Because we've got   to do some 1521

2                desi gnat i on.

3                           Do you want   t o do a designation today,   Judge?

4                          THE COURT:     I   don' t   ni nd doi ng a desi gnat i on

5                today.      I   would  prefer   to do Curmri ngs  today  if   there's

6                a reasonabl e I i kel i hood t hat   he' s goi ng to be

7               testifying on  IVbnday.

8                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Curmri ngs will   be,   I   think,   pretty

9                brief,   but   I   could be wrong.     I   was told there was  one

10                document.

11                           THE COURT:     I   don't   want   to  leave both  Curmri ngs

12                and  Benowitz for   IVbnday  morning.

13                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     We  need to make our   record with

14                regard t o t he exhibits  and  I   don't   know t hat   it's

15                goi ng t o take that   long.     But   we need to be able to go

16                t hrough and get   t he j udge to rul e on each exhi bi t ,   and

17               we'll   need to preserve any  issues we have with  regards

18                tot hose exhi bi t s,   and we' I I   do t hat   as  expedi t i ousl y

19               with Your   Honor   as we possibly can.     But   as  you know,

20               we are al I   about   maki ng a proper   record.

21                           THE COURT:     Sure.

22                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     You  have got   written objections  --

23                Brent,   hold on a ninute.     You  have got   written

24                objections which  make the WIN arms,   State  Farm,   all

25                this,   and why don't   we --1522

1                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Because what   you're suggesting  is

2                that   the Court   would si rrpl y take the objections

3               wi t hout   ever   at   I east   I ooki ng at   t he document   and

4                rule.     And you can't   --   I   mean,   I   think that   would  be,

5                i n  nry opinion,   I   don't   think the Court   can si rrpl y

6                overrule our   objections without   even at   least   looking

7                at   t he document s.

8                          THE COURT:     I   don' t   ni nd doi ng  i t   now.      I   woul d

9                prefer   not   to do both  Curmri ngs  and  Benowitz  IVbnday

10                morning,   if   there's a reasonable likelihood that   both

11                of   t hem wi I I   be called on  IVbnday.

12                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And we're prepared to deal   with

13                Curmri ngs  now.

14                          THE COURT:     Okay.

15                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And  I   wi I I   say this.      I f   we can

16                get   through  Curmri ngs  and we'll   go through as

17                expeditiously as we can,   and we can deal   with

18                Dr.   Wei nst ei n,   the designations,   then  --

19                unfortunately,   I'm not   going  home this weekend,   so we

6               we can kind of   work it   that   way,   if   that's

7                per rri ssi bl e.

8                          THE COURT:     Sure.

9                           IVR.   COFER:     Your   Honor,   IVr.   Tepi ki an  has  asked

10                t hat   I   leave.      Is  that   okay with you?

11                           IVR.   BIGGER:     I   prefer   that   as well,   Your   Honor.

12                          THE COURT:     You are excused.

13                           IVR.   BIGGER:     I   thought   it   was  going to be pretty

14                straightforward on this  issue.     IVkybe  I   rri sunder st ood.

15                           IVB.   HUIVPHRI ES:     Your   Honor,   while they're

16                gathering their   things,   I   do want   to take a moment   to

17               tell   you both sides  have been kind enough to bombard

18                you with proposed orders while you've been  i n t he

19                courtroom   which  rright   be sitting  right   next   to you.

20                          So we  have worked out   the vast   majority of   them

21                I've seen their   correspondence,   they've seen  nine.

22                There's  a few sets where we have given you conrpet i ng

23                orders which are relatively si rri I ar.     So  I   don't   know

24                if   you want   to --   if   you appreciate  having that   before

25                you to begin your   weekend. 1524

1                           THE COURT:     I   have those --   I   have the ones  that

2                have been agreed upon and  I   have the ones that   are

3                st i I I   i n di sput e.

4                          IVB.   HUIVPHRI ES:     Wel I ,   we  have broken t hem out,

5                Your   Honor,   by  hearing dates,   just   because there's

6                been a large  number.     So rry  understanding is you  have

7                IVarch 29th agreed  upon and then two sets  of   not   agreed

8                upon,   and then April   9th,   you should also have some

9                IVarch 5th,   I   think,   but   --   there's  a couple  more

10                coning to you,   but   the bulk of   it   should  have gotten

11                to you  by  now.

12                          THE COURT:     I   got   them   I   believe.     That's what

13                t hi s  paperwork  i s.

14                          IVB.   HUIVPHRI ES:     Thank you.

15                           ( Di scussi on off   the record.)

16                           IVR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   the first   one is

17                Plaintiff's  Exhibit   12.      11' s  an advertisement   from

18                Reynolds from 1984,   entitled:     Can we  have an open

19                debate about   smoking?

20                          We've  laid out   all   our   written objections  and

21                what   we filed,   but   the biggest   objection  here is

22                relevance.     There's  no evidence that   IVT.   Wilis  ever

23                saw t hi s.      It   was  publ i shed i n  1984.     Fie was  al ready

24                43 years  old.     Fie wasn't   smoking a Reynolds  brand at

25                t he t i me.     So we woul d obj ect   to t hi s  on  rel evance 1525

1                grounds.     We also observed unfair   prejudice,   WI I i arms

2                and  St at e  Far m

3                          THE COURT:     I'll   overrule that   objection.     You

4                can certainly cross-exarri ne  Dr.   Cumri ngs with  regard

6                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And Your   Honor,   for   the  record,

10                part   of   the  record for   the Court.      I'm turning to the

11                page where we have laid out   the objections  by exhibit,

14                          THE COURT:     I   have seen these.

15                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   ex hi bi t   is  PI ai nt i f f' s  307.

16                It's  t he  Frank statement,   cigarette smokers,   that   IW.

17                Uiterwyk showed during opening.

18                          Again,   relevance.     There's  no evidence  IW.   Wilis

19                ever   saw t hi s document.     It   was  published one time

20               when  he was   13 years  old.      It   was  never   published

21                again.     It's  irrelevant   to this  case and to

22                     IW.   WI I i s.

23                          THE COURT:     Okay.     Overruled.

24                          IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And,   Your   Honor,   I   know IW.   Yarber

25                is  kind of   running this  for   us,   but   I   will   also note 1526

1                we have additional   objections that   we would assert

2               with  regard to each of   these documents.

3                          THE COURT:      I   see t hat .

4                          IVR.   BI QGER:     Anyt hi ng  in wr i t i ng,   we st i pul at e as

5                preserved.

6                          THE COURT:     There's  a great   deal   of   objections  in

7                each of   t hese obj ect i ons  i n wr i 11 en f or m     We' r e j ust

9                           IVB.   HUIVPHRI ES:     Your   Honor,   for   the  record,   I'm

10               just   going to add a I ot   of   the arguments that   are

11                bei ng  made wer e  made pr evi ousl y  i n  mot i ons  in  I i nri ne.

12                So we have already  made responses to these same

13                arguments  in our   responses.

14                          THE COURT:     Thi s  i s  t rue.

15                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Bruce,   I   mean,   obviously,   we're

16                stipulating your   objections are preserved.     Cur

17               written  responses  to your   motions  in  I i nri ne are

18                i ncor porat ed?

19                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Yes.

20                           IVR.   BIGGER:     I ' m not   goi ng t o  r est at e t hem al I .

21                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   one,   we  have a coupl e  now

22                that   are videos.     517,   525 and 531,   I'll   do al I

23                together.     These are all   advertisements  for   Reynolds

24                brand cigarettes.     Obviously,   we'll   stand on our

25               written objections.     There's  no evidence  IW.   Wilis 1527

1                ever   saw any  of   t hese.

2                          We al so have an addi t i onal   obj ect ion to t he

3                Fl i nt st ones  advertisement   on 403 grounds  because,

4                obviously,   the  Fl i nt st ones  in  1950 was  advertised as

5                adult   television,   but   now there's  obviously,   in 2010,

6                everyone thinks  of   the  Fl i nt st ones  as  a youth cartoon,

7               whi ch i t   wasn't   at   t he t i me.     But   therefore,   there's  a

8                prejudicial   corrponent   here because,   you know,   people

9                are  looking at   it   through the  lens  of   today,   not   1960.

10                          THE (XXJRT:     Understood.     The objections  are duly

11                noted and overruled.

12                           IVR.   YARBER:     540 --   actually,   I   should  have

13                i ncl uded t hat   one as wel I .     That' s  a Lucky  St r i ke

14               video.     Same objections that   we just   raised on the

15                others.

16                          THE COURT:     Same  rul i ng.

1                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   exhibit   is

2                588.      I   alerted  IW.   Bigger   yesterday that   this  exhibit

3                had been somehow doct or ed,   for   lack of   a better   t er rn

4                and  I' m not   suggesting that   IW.   Bigger   or   anybody  in

5                hi s  f i r m di d t hat.     But   t her e was  a wor d t hat   was

6                inserted into the video.     They  have replaced that.     So

7                nry  understanding is that   will   not   be shown.

8                           IVR.   Bl QGER:     We act ual I y j ust   cut   it.      11' s  i n

9                the video.     We just   sliced that   piece of   the frame out

10                so i t   never   appears.

11                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     So what   t hi s  i s,   i s  t hi s  i s  a

12                vi deo cal I ed:     Do you  i nhal e?

13                          The same objections,   you  have them written there,

14               Your   Honor.     Relevance,   hearsay,   unfair   prejudice,   and

15               we had authentication,   but   that's  been cured.

16                          THE COURT:     Cverrul ed.

17                          IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   one,   Your   Honor,   is  a

18                Reynolds document.      It's  Plaintiff's  Exhibit   1040,

19                it's  one of   the blue sky  pieces  of   Dr.   Teague from

rri ne Your

se t he hearsay

n  I i rri ne for

20                1973.     This was  part   of   the motion  in  I

21                Honor   has  already  heard,   so we would  rai

22                obj ect i on t hat   we  rai sed in t he  mot i on

23                Dr.   Teague on this  because it   was  not   written as  part

24                of   his  duties  at   Reynolds;   it   was written arising out

25                of   his  UNC graduate program course that   was  part   of 1529

1                our   rrot i on  in  I i rri ne.

2                          We woul d al so j ust   rai se t he obj ect i on of

3                relevance and unfair   prejudice in this case because

4                it's  thoughts  on the youth  market.     IW.   Wilis was

5                32 years  ol d at   t he t i me.     This  has  zero  relevance to

6                hi m     11   has  absol ut el y  no r el evance at   t he t i me wher e

7                he was  a youth,   and so we would  raise that   objection

8                as wel I .

9                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule that

10                obj ect i on.

11                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   I ' m handi ng you

13                           IVR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   1045  looks  like --

14               frankly,   I   t hi nk  I   would  have an authenticity

15                objection to this.      I ' m not   sure where this  comes

16                from     It   looks  like it   may be a press  release from

17               the  Federal   Trade Corrm ssi on who were  reporting on

18                their   report   on tar   and  nicotine levels  of   different

19                ci garet t es.

20                           I   t hi nk t he PI ai nt i f f s are going to need to lay a

21                foundation for   this  one before adrritting  into

22                evidence,   because there's  really  no indicia of   where

23                this  comes  from     So i t' s  authenticity and  hearsay.

24               And  I'm not   even sure what   the relevance of   it   is,   but

25                unt i I   a wi t ness  aut hent i cat es  this  one,   I   don' t   t hi nk 1530

2                          THE (COURT:     Al I   r i ght .     Subj ect   tot he  PI ai nt i f f

3                I ayi ng a proper   f oundat i on,   I'll   ot herwi se over r ul e

5                           MR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   I ' m handi ng you

6                PI ai nti f f' s  Exhi bi t   1207.

7                          We have listed a number   of   objections with regard

8                t o t hi s  exhibit,   but   we also note that   this  exhibit

9                contains a number   of   exhibit   stickers from other

10                cases.     So in addition to our   other   objections,   we

11                would ask that   the exhibit   stickers from other   cases

12                be removed from this  document   before shown or   used,   if

13                the Court   were to overrule our   objection.

14                          MR.   BIGGER:     Sometimes they  ask for   it,   sometimes

15                they don't.     Wien they  ask f or   i t,   I   don't   nri nd doing

16                it.      11' s  not   a pr obi em

17                          THE COURT:     I'll   over r ul e t he obj ect i on,   but   I

18               wi I I   r equest   t hat   t he  PI ai nt i f f   r emove t he exhi bi t

19                stickers.      I   don't   want   t hem t o think that   this  is

20                part   of   the  Engl e  I   or   get   confused.

21                           MR.   BI GGER:     That' s  f i ne.

22                          THE COURT:     There's  been another   trial   that   night

23                i nrpact   their   decision,   but   otherwise  I'll   overrule

24               t hei r   obj ect i on.

25                           MR.   YARBER:     And  if   I   may,   just   can we ask for 1531

1                t hat   on al I   t he exhi bi t s,   in case we don' t   ment i on

2                one,   like  Dr.   Teague' s  memo,   for   exarrpl e,   has  that,

3                too.     So i f   we can do that   on all   further   exhibits.

4                          MR.   BIGGER:     If   there's  a Plaintiff's  exhibit

5                from a previous day or   if   it   was  a deposition exhibit

6                or   what ever.

7                          THE COURT:     Li ke on t he  next   one.

8                           MR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   the next   one is

9                Reynolds.      It's  a letter   that   Reynolds wrote in  1990

10                t o t he pr i nci pal   of   t he W I I ow R dge  El ement ar y  School

11                up i n Amberst,   New York.

12                          We would object   to this  on  relevance.     I   mean,

13                i t' s  f rom 1990.     IW.   Wilis di dn" t   see t hi s.      It   was

14                sent   to a school.      It   has  nothing to do with the

15                issues  in this  case.     It   was,   ironically enough --   if

16                you do al I ow t hi s  in  --   it   was  prompted  by

17                Dr.   Curmri ngs  going t o t he school   and asking the kids

18                to write to  Reynolds  to try and solicit   this  response,

19               which he actually did.

20                           Notably,   Reynolds  did  not   send this  response back

21                t o t he children,   but   sent   it   t o t he principal   and  let

22                her   deal   with  how t o proceed.     But   it's  conrpl et el y

23                i r r el evant   to t hi s  case.

24                          M.   Wilis wasn't   in Anrherst,   New York.     Fie  never

25                saw t hi s.      It   has  not hi ng to do wi t h t he f act s  of   hi s 1532

1                case.     Fie was  not   even smoking a Reynolds  product   in

2                1990.     So those would  be our   objections.

3                           MR.   BIGGER:     If   I   can just   clarify two things,

4               Your   Honor.     This  is  the same  response that   pretty

5                rruch any consumer   would get   if   they  contacted  RJ.

6                Reynolds at   t hi s t i me.     I   t hi nk t he objections  are

7                obviously  because this  is  elementary  school   children,

8                and  if   t hat' s t hei r   concern,   I   understand.

9                           But   t hi s  is t hei r   company execut i ve who di d t hi s.

10                This was their   company  position.     The i dea t hat   it   was

11                a pr i nci pal ,   i f   you'll   note the last   paragraph by

12                IVb.   Spook:     We would appreciate your   passing this

13                information along to your   students  --   who she

14                obviously  recognizes they were fifth-grade students  at

15                t he t i me - -   we would appreciate your   passing this

16                information and this  letter   along to your   students.

17                          So t he i dea t hat   it   was wr i 11 en to t he pr i nci pal

18                i s f i ne,   but   she actually asked t hem t o tell   her

19                students this as well.

20                          Thi s  i s  t he t i me when  M.   Wilis was  still

21                smoking.     This was  the comment   the conrpany was  doing.

22                This  is  certainly  information that   should be before

23                t hi s j ury.

24                          MR.   YAFBER:     If   I   just   --   brief   response,   Your

25                Honor.      If   we had sent   a consumer   letter   to 1533

1                IW.   Wilis,   completely acceptable,   cornel et el y

2                relevant,   conrpl et el y  adni ssi bl e.     This  is to some

3                principal   in a school    1,500 ni I es from here that   he

4                never   could  have seen,   didn't   see;   there's  no evidence

5                he saw i t.

6                          And to suggest   that   this  somehow i s  --   I   mean,

7               this  goes  to State  Far m and WIN arms,   too.     This

8                conduct   has  not hi ng to do wi t h t he  PI ai nt i f f.     Thi s

9                should  not   come into evidence.

10                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule the

11                obj ect i on - -

12                           MR.   BIGGER:     I   was  going to say t o t he extent   it

13                goes  to WIN arms,   Your   Honor,   we' re f i I i ng a I i rri ne

14                instruction on this document.

15                          THE COURT:     I ' m st r uggl i ng wi t h this  one a little

16                bi t   j ust   because i t' s  a pr i nci pal   of   a f i f t h- grade

17                elementary  school   in Amherst,   New York.

18                           I'll   I et   t he j ur y det er rri ne whet her   or   not   t hi s

19                is  relevant   to their   inquiry.     You can certainly

20                cross- exam ne the doctor   about   his  role in this

21                document   and the likelihood of   IW.   Wilis  having

22                knowl edge of   it   or   it   i impact i ng  hi m i n any way.

23                           MR.   YARBER:     IWay  I   ask for   a redaction of   any

24                reference t o t he fact   that   this was  sent   to a school

25                and put   the facts  in that   was  our   company position on 1534

1                ci garet t es?

2                          THE COURT:     No,   you can ask that   the sticker   be

3                removed because there is a sticker   on there,   but

4                ot herwi se i t   wi I I   be adrri ssi bl e.

5                           MR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   the next   one is  another

6                Reynolds document.      It's  1980,   written by  IW.   Hall

7                entitled:     Younger   adult   smokers.

8                          Again,   1980,   M.   Wilis was  39 years  old.     This

9                is  conrpl et el y  irrelevant   t o IW.   Wilis.      I   don't   see

10               why this would  be in any way  relevant   t o t he issues  he

11                has  raised in this  case.     And they're going to try and

12                use it   to show some improper   purpose,   like some youth

13                market i ng.

14                          M.   Wilis was  39 years  old.      It   had absolutely

15                no i impact   on  hi m     11' s  not   relevant   to those issues.

16                It   would be i improper   under   State  Far m and W I I i aims  to

17                adni t   it.

18                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule the

19                objection,   finding that   there may be relevance that

20                the jurors  attach to this  particular   document.

21                           MR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   the next   one is

22                PI ai nt i f f' s   1493,   i t' s  a memo - -   a Br own  & W I I i aimson

23                memo that   forwards  an attachment.     We would object   to

24               this  on  privilege grounds.

25                          This  is  --   Addison Yeanran wrote this.     Fie was 1535

1                general   counsel   of   Brown & Wl I i anrson,   he was  i n  I aw

2                department.     And  he's  attaching to it   a summary of   a

3                meet i ng of   counsel   t hat   was  hel d to t al k about   I egal

4                issues,   to provide legal   advice.     This should  not   be

5                adni ssi bl e in t hi s  case,   and it's 403 because i t   has

6                not hi ng t o do wi t h t he i ssues t hat   ar e at   pi ay  her e i n

7               t he cl ai as  of   IW.   Wl I i s.

8                          THE COURT:      IW.   Bi gger?

9                           MT.   BIGGER:     Can  I   see which one i t   i s?

10                          Addison Yeanran,   in addition to being general

11                counsel   of   Br own & W I I i anrson,   was  t he di r ect or   of

12                CTR     As Your   Honor   will   hear,   through the testimony

13                of   Dr.   Cunmi ngs,   CTR,   the Center   for   Tobacco  Research,

14               which was  the successor   organization for   Tl RC was  the

15               way the companies  executed this fraud and the

16                conspiracy that   has  been found in  Engl e  Phase  I.

17                           I   t hi nk t hat   generally,   as to the privilege

18                claims  regarding conduct   that   relates to that   fraud,   I

19                t hi nk t he or i me fraud exception applies  and there is

20                no privilege any  longer.     That's  the position that's

21                been  maintained by the  Department   of   Justice case.

22                          There's  many  privilege assertions  in that   case,

23                particularly  one with  regard to the  Bl i I ey documents,

24               whi ch  I   t hi nk we' I I   t al k about   her e in a little bi t .

25                But   in that   case,   there's  an order   on the Bl i I ey 1536

1                documents that   they're no longer   privileged,   that   the

2                privilege has  been waived or   the exception applies.

3                The same is  true for   these.     These  lawyers were the

4                lawyers  that   were  running the very  heart   of   the fraud

5                t hat   was exi st i ng in t hi s  case.

6                           I   believe this document   has  been adni t ted in

7                several   other   Engl e progeny cases and it   is  identified

8                on that   list   that   we gave Your   Honor.

9                           I   apol ogi ze  I   don' t   have i t .     Agai n,   I   t hought

10                that   this was  a nruch  more cursory  process we were

11                goi ng t o be doi ng on these Cunmri ngs  documents  and so  I

12                apologize that   I ' m not   better   prepared on the

13                document.

14                          But   the document,   I   believe,   may  have even be

15                adni t ted in  Engl e  Phase  I,   and  I   know t hat   we  have

16                that   document   as wel I .     We can probably  let   you know

17                if   it   has  been,   but   I   know t hat   it's  been adni t ted in

18                other   cases.

19                          And t o t he extent   there's  been any  privilege

20                remaining,   I   think that,   you  know,   the burden  is  on

21                t hem t o show t hat   there's  still   privilege remaining.

22                I   don't   think they  have  met   that   burden  by  si nrpl y

23                sayi ng t hat   t hi s was wr i 11 en  by  a I awyer   who was  al so

11                           MR.   YAFBER:     Thank you,   Your   Honor.

12                           MR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   one is  a film

16                "Face the Nation"   episode.     Wfe object   to that   under

17                relevance,   hearsay,   unfair   prejudice.     This  is  a film

18                clip where he is  being asked questions about   the

19                proposed advertising ban and we would suggest   it   has

20                not hi ng to do wi t h any  of   t he i ssues  in t hi s  case.

21                           THE COURT:     I'll   overrule that   objection,   finding

22                that   I've discussed  many of   these issues  previously

23                and t hat   I'll   I eave to t he j ury to det er ni ne t he

25                           MR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   one is  a film 1538

7                          THE COURT:     All   right.     Overruled.

8                           MR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   one is

9                another   video clip.     This  is  Plaintiff's  Exhibit   1683.

10                It's  a "20/20"   investigative  report   by John  St ossel ,

11                and  it   has  t o do - -   it's  entitled,   "Growing  Up  In

12                Smoke."     It's  a  1983 investigative  report   where --   and

13                I   t hi nk you're probably f arri I i ar   with  "20/20"   and the

14               way they  kind of   phrase things  and do things with

15                regard to their   investigative  report.      It   questions

16               whether   or   not   there's  any youth  marketing  issues

17                goi ng on.

18                          We would object   to that   under   W I I i arms  and State

19                Farm     You  have our   written objections with  regard to

20                that,   as well   as  relevance and hearsay,   unfair

21                prejudice.     There is  a significant   amount   of

22                commentary  by  IW.   St ossel   during the course of   the

23                epi sode.

24                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule that

20                           If   you  remember,   Your   Honor,   "Death  i n t he West"

21                was  t he vi deo t hat   was  made over   i n  Engl and.      11   was

22                never   shown  i n t he  United  States.      It   was  never

23                allowed to be shown i n t he  United States.     There's  a

24                court   order   out   of   England that   it   not   be shown i n t he

25                Uni ted  States. 1540

1                           Now,   M.   Uiterwyk  has  told the jury that   that   was

2                a public statement   that   was  made t o t he American

3                public.      It   happened during the opening,   but   I   would

4                suggest,   Your   Honor,   they  should  not   be allowed to use

5                ei t her   t he vi deo wi t h  regard to  W.   Bowl i ng or

8                          And  I   told you this  is going to create another

9                issue that   we have to deal   with.     We would  renew our

10                mot i on wi t h  regard t o t hat ,   in addition t o t he other

11                objections we have noted.

12                          THE COURT:     All   right.     All   t he obj ect i ons  ar e

13                noted and overruled.

14                          MR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   exhibit   is

15                another   video,   1689.     This  is  an  interview of

16                Hartnett.     We've noted objections with  regard to that,

17                including  relevance,   hearsay,   and unfair   prejudice.

18                          THE COURT:     Duly  noted and overruled.

19                           MR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   the next   one is

22                st at e i n our   written  record,   is  relevance.     There's  no

23                evi dence IW.   Wilis  saw t hi s  in  1984,   and so we woul d

24                object   on that,   plus we'll   stand on our   written

14                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule that

8                           IVR.   YARBER:     That's  another   one for   me.     This  is

9                another   research planning  memo from Dr.   Teague,   same

10                as t he one we looked at   earlier   on the youth market.

11                Same objections that   this  is  hearsay  because it's  not

12                a business  record,   and  relevance,   unfair   prejudice,

13                State  Farm,   and WIN arms.

14                          THE COURT:     All   right.     Overruled.

17                objections with  regards  to that,   Your   Honor.      In

18                addition,   you'll   note that   that   document   has a I ot   of

19                litigation stickers.     Pursuant   t o t he agreement   we had

20                before,   those should all   be removed before that

22                           IVR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   we would also ask for   a

23                redaction of   this.     They're talking about   litigation

24                strategy  in this document.     That's  not   appropriate and

25                relevant   to this  case,   and  it's  403. 1543

5                objection to this  document.      It   was  not   written by

6                Reynolds,   B&W   Philip IVbrris.      It   was  not   written  by

10                addition,   we have relevance,   hearsay within  hearsay,

11                and the other  written objections that   we have stood

23                           IVR.   BIGGER:     There's  an entire series  of   archives

2                Plaintiff's  Exhibit   2141,   and  I   believe  IvT.   Yarber   is

4                          IVR.   YARBER:     Yes,   Judge.     This  is  another

5                Reynolds document   from Dr.   Rodgman.     Again,   we'll

6                stand on our   written objections.     There is  no

16                the second page of   the document,   there's  a reference

17               to Shook  Hardy  & Bacon,   ny  I aw f i r m     They  redacted  it

18                during their   opening statement.

19                           Pursuant   t o t he  mot i on i n  I i nri ne,   if   t hat

20                document   is  used,   it   should be - -   the name of   the law

21                firm should be redacted,   if   you  look at   the third

22                I i ne,   Your   Honor.

23                          THE COURT:     Ch,    I   see.

24                          IVR.   YARBER:     I   would just   add,   Your   Honor,   that

25                t hi s  i s  obviously talking about   litigation strategy. 1545

1                This document,   we objected to it   i n t he Broward cases.

2                Judge Streitfeld  has  excluded this  document   in  Broward

3                County  because of   the references to litigation or   he

4                has  allowed  Plaintiffs to adni t   it,   but   with redacting

5                t he I ast   f our   I i nes on page 2 because of   t he

6                litigation strategy issues.

7                          THE COURT:      IW.   Bi gger?

8                           IVR.   BIGGER:     It's  been adni t ted  in about   every

9                other   case,   Your   Honor,   including in  Escanbi a by Judge

10                Terrell   and Alachua by Judge  Roundtree,   and  most

11                recently  by Judge  Hul si ander   in the  Flail   case.

12                          This  is  essentially the essence of   why they were

13                lying about   what   their   product   could do.      It   was  to

14                avoid litigation and avoid being sued.     If   people knew

15                about   addiction,   we couldn't   go in there and defend on

16                free choice.     It   is a document   that   goes t o t he heart

17                of   t he conspiracy  and the fraud,   Your   Honor.

18                          And  Kl oepf er   and  Knopi ck worked for   the Tobacco

21                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Yeah.      I'll   al so  not e t hat   it   is

22                double  hearsay,   maybe a little further   removed than

23                t hat .

24                          THE COURT:     I ' m a little concer ned wi t h t hi s

25                sentence,   and  maybe it's  splitting  hairs  or   making 1546

1                distinctions where it's  not   necessary.     But:     Shook

2                Hardy  reminds  us,   I'm told,   that   the entire  matter   of

3                addiction i s t he most   potent   weapon a prosecuting

4                attorney can  have in a lung cancer/ci gar et t e case.

5                          That   line is  of   some concern t o  me:     A,   i n t he

6                number   of   potential   hearsay that   is  involved in that

7                statement;   but,   B,   al so wi t h  regard t o t he  reference

9                           IVR.   BIGGER:     We're  redacting that   reference to

10                t he  I aw f i r m

11                           IVR.   UI TERWYK:     It   was  i n t he opening.     The law

12                f i r m i s  out.

13                           IVB.   HUIVPHRI ES:     It   says  attorney.

14                          IVR.   UI TERWYK:     It   says:     The lawyers tell   us.

15                And we actually  redacted that.

16                          THE COURT:     To t hat   extent,   I'll   overrule the

17                obj ect i on.

18                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Thank you,   Your   Honor.     There was

8                           IvR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Your   Honor,   the  next   exhibit   is

10                to,   quote,   Johnny Junior.     This  is  the gentleman who

11                di d t he cal I   f or   Phi I i p Morris advertising.     We have

12               written objections with  regard t o t hat.     We would also

13                add,   Your   Honor,   Mr.   Wilis  never,   ever   smoked  Philip

14                Morris  brand cigarette.     Fie smoked  Ivarlboro brand

15                cigarettes,   and you  heard  M.   Uterwyk say that   was  in

16                t he  I at e ' 80s.     So t hi s  document   f r om 1953  not   i n any

17               way  relevant   with  regard t o Mr.   Wilis.

18                           In addition,   there's  a statement   in there with

19                regard to,   you know,   kids'   cigarettes,   and we would

20                ask at   a ni ni nrum t hat   be redacted out   of   this

21                document.

22                          THE COURT:     Let   me  r ead  it.

23                           M-.   Bi gger?

24                          IvR.   BI GGER:     Thi s  is when  he was  a ki d.      I   mean,

25                their   arguments  are always  that   the youth can't   come 1548

1                in because it's  irrelevant   because it's  not   when  he's

2                a ki d.     And  now when  he i s  a ki d,   they want   to keep it

3                out.     It   doesn't   matter   that   he didn't   smoke that

4                brand.     That   was  another   thing that   he was  exposed to,

5               j ust   I i ke t hey' re goi ng to come i n and t hey' re goi ng

6                to put   in things from the  New York Times  papers that

7                he never   read,   but   things  that   they want   to say  he was

8                exposed to out   there i n t he sphere of   possible places.

9                Thi s  i s what   the conrpani es were doing.     They were

10                sending Johnny Junior   around to try  and  meet   with  kids

11                at   shopping  malls  in different   places,   and try  and

12                promote their   products  t o t he youth of   this  country,

13               just   like M".   Uterwyk said the evidence is  going to

14                show.     Because those were their   replacement   smokers

15                that   they were going to need.

16                          THE COURT:     I'll   over r ul e t he obj ect i on.      I

17                understand that   it   --   this  goes  t o t he very  heart   of

18                the defense opposition and 403,   et   cetera,   but   I   have

19                consi dered al I   t hat,   I   t hi nk previ ousl y,   and wi I I

20                over rul e t he

21                           IvR   HUlvPHRI ES:     That's  correct,   Your   Honor,   you

22                have.

23                           IvR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   before we go forward,   if

24                I   can go backward just   one second,   just   for   the

25                record.     2184,   which  is  that   Knopi ck,   the KI oepf er 1549

1                mem),   that   you  had concerns about   that   sentence.

2                           ( Di scussi on off   the record.)

3                           IvR.   YARBER:     W)ul d  like to go back to 2184 for   a

4                ni nut e.     That's  the Knopi ck,   the  KI oepf er   memo,   that

5                you were concerned about   the sentence that   had the

6                Shook,   Hardy  & Bacon.     I   have just   been passed a note

7               t hat   i n t he  Hal I   case,   M".   Bigger   represented that   was

8                adnitted.     That   sentence,   in fact,   redacted i n t he

9               Hal I   case.

10                           IvR.   BIGGER:     No,   no,   no.     He took out

11                "prosecuting attorney"   is what   he took out.     Flail   was

13                           IVR.   YARBER:     But   the entire sentence,   I'm told,

14               was  redacted that   you were concerned about.

15                           IVR.   BIGGER:     That's wrong.     Judge  Roundt ree,

19                prosecuting attorney taken out.

20                          THE COURT:     That's  not   troublesome to  me,   that

21                phrase.     The  I aw f i r m r ef erence,   specific  I aw f i r m

22                reference is  problematic.

23                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Wii ch we agree.

24                          THE COURT:     Okay.

25                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   one i s  2268.     We  have a 1550

1                number   of   objections to this  one.     This  is,   again,   a

2                privileged document.     You've got   references  t o t he

3                different   general   counsels  of   the firms,   meeting for

4               the litigation issues.     There's  a reference to Shook,

5                Hardy & Bacon that   needs to be redacted.

18                general   counsel's,   legal   advice.     And so we would

19                maintain that   privilege.

20                          THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule that

22                           IVR.   BIGGER:     I   have the order   from the  DOJ  case,

23                Your   Honor,   that   fully  analyzes  that   issue.      I   had

24                copies  of   it   when we were going to argue these a

7                authenticity and hearsay,   they  need to lay a

8                f oundat i on as to why t hi s woul d be adrri ssi bl e.

9                           Even  if   they  lay the authenticity foundation,

10                i t' s  st i I I   hear say as  Reynol ds  because it's  a third

11                party that   was  not   owned by or   controlled by or   in any

12               way  part   of   Reynolds,   Philip IVbrris;   it   was  a separate

13                entity.     John  Hill   did  public  relations  for   hundreds

14                of   different   conrpani es.

11                           IVR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   I   would object   to

12                Plaintiff's  Exhibit   3196.     This  looks  like it   was

13               written  by the Tiderock  Corporation.      I   don't   know who

14               the Tiderock Corporation is,   but   it's  certainly  not

15                Reynolds.      It's  certainly  not   Philip IVbrris,   and  it's

16                not   Tl   or   CTR

17                          There's  an authenticity  problem   there's  a

18                hearsay  problem,   and there's  also handwriting all   over

19                this  document.      I   don't   know where that   comes  from      I

20                don't   know what   it   is,   but   that   we  have an

21                aut hent i ci t y  on t hat.

22                          And then we would also have a relevance and

23                unfair   prejudice,   State  Far m and Wlliams,   because we

24                have  no idea what   this  is,   where it   comes from     They

25                should  not   be adnitted. 1554

1                           THE COURT:      IW.   Bi gger?

2                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Tiderock was  hired  by  either   Tl   or

3                CTR t o do this  cigarette controversy  carrpai gn.      It   was

4               the early  '80s,   I   want   to say.     Late '70s,   early  '80s,

5                I   t hi nk  i t   was.

6                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     And  i t   was  act ual I y  Tl .

8                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Sorry.     Late '60s.      I   apologize.      It

9               was  after   the Surgeon  General's  report.      It   was  kind

10                of   I i ke t he Cullman to Wei ss man,   the strategy we've

11                have for   20 years  has  been great,   but   we need

12                something  new f or   the future,   welcome to Tiderock.

13                          Ti der ock was  t he  new pi an for   the f ut ur e,   as

14                evidenced  by their   documents.     Dr.   Curmri ngs  has  used

15                this  document   before.      Fie's very f arri I i ar   with  it,   and

16                he can  lay the foundation.

17                          THE COURT:     Subject   t o t he  laying of   proper

18                foundation,   I'll   overrule those objections.

19                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   one,   3400,   it's  a Reynolds

20                document   fromlVs.   Boughs t o IW.   Long and others.      It's

21                entitled,   "Younger   Adult   Smokers,   Strategies  and

22                Opportunities."     Again,   relevance,   from 1984,

23                IW .   WI I i s was  33 - -   IW .   Wilis,   yeah,   he was  43 year s

24                old.      It   has  absolutely  no  relevance to hi m

25                           Fie was  not   a yout h,   he was  not   a young adul t ;   he 1555

1                wasn't   even smoking a Reynolds  brand at   t hi s t i me.     So

2                it   has  no  relevance,   and then obviously  unfair

3                prejudice,   W I I i arms  and  State  Farm

4                          THE COURT:     I'll   over r ul e t hose obj ect i ons.

5                           (A di scussi on was  hel d of f   t he  record. )

6                           IVR.   YARBER:     Dr.   Teague,   this  is  from 1953.     Wfe

7               would object   to hearsay within hearsay.     Fie cites  a

8                bunch of   other   documents,   quotes  from them      It's  --

9                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And  I   would  note  Reynolds  and

10                Phi I i p Mor r i s  have f i I ed a mot ion in  I i ni ne wi t h

11                regard to Teague' s documents.

12                          THE COURT:     I'll   over r ul e t hose obj ect i ons.

13                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   is  PI ai nt i f f' s

14                Exhibit   3615.     This  is  another   privileged document.

15                Thi s  i s  a memo written  by Addison Yeaman,   again,

16                general   counsel   of   Brown &WI Hanson.

17                          There are a couple problems with this  document:

18                One,   is  it's  a privileged document   written by general

19                counsel;   two,   it's  a Bl i I ey document   that   we

20                maintained our   privilege on;   three,   there's

21                significant   discussion in  here about   litigation

22                strategy that   if   this  document   is  adm'tted we would

23                I i ke t o have redacted;   and,   finally  he spent   a

24                significant   amount   of   time quoting from the  Bat el I e

25                Labs  study,   which  is  an outside study.     So it's 1556

1                hearsay within  hearsay.

2                           In addition,   the  Bat el I e  Labs  Pi ppo study  and the

3                f at e of   nicotine documents were bad science.     We filed

4                a mot i on in  I i ni ne on t hat ,   I   bel i eve i t   was deni ed,

5                but   we would  maintain our   objections to that.

6                          THE COURT:     The objections  and  privileges  are

7                preserved and overruled.

8                           IVR.   YARBER:     The  next   one is  PI ai nt i f f' s  3709.

9                Thi s  i s  a document   --   it   has  a significant   amount   of

10                handwri t i ng on  i t.      11' s  an i nconrpl et e document.      I f

11                you  look at   the back,   the last   document,   page 6,   it

12                cl ear I y  cut s  of f   i n a ni ddl e of   a sent ence.     So t hey

13                need to come up with the complete version of   this

14               document;   otherwise,   there's  an authenticity.

15                           IVR.   UITERVWK:     That's  the one that's  24 pages.

16                           IVR.   YARBER:     There ar e t wo versions  of   this

17               document.     There's  a 7-page short   version and there's

9                exhibits,   and let   me read the exhibit   numbers,   that's

10                probably the easiest   way t o do i t,   Plaintiff's  Exhibit

11                  3855,   3856,   3857,   3858,   3859,   3860,   3861,   3862,   3863,

12                 3864.

13                          All   of   those exhibits,   Your   Honor,   it's

14                essentially the entire Waxman  hearing with  regard when

15                the tobacco conrpany executives were brought   in to

16                testify  before Congress.     I   know there was  a small

17                cl i p of   t hat   played during  Plaintiff's  opening today.

18                I   know t hat   we f i I ed a mot ion  in  I i ni ne wi t h  r egar d t o

19                that.

20                          Your   Honor,   t hi s  i s  I i ke - -   I   t hi nk  i t' s  about   a

21                day's worth of   video clips when you take all   of   these

22                together.

23                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Seven  Dwarfs,   Ti sch,   and  Canrpbel I ;

24               t hat' s  i t.     These are clips that   have been used in

25                pri or   cases. 1558

1                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Here's what   I   would ask:     Tell   me

2                the exhibit   numbers for   those clips  that   you intend to

3                play.     I   assume one of   t hem was the clip that   was

4                pi ayed dur i ng  PI ai nt i f f' s  openi ng t oday.

5                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Congressman Vtyden.

6                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Please tell   me t he exhibit   numbers

7               f or   t he other   two clips  that   you  intend to use with

8                Dr.   Cunmri ngs.

9                          Your   Honor,   you  have our   objections with  regard

10                t o t he use of   t hose vi deo cl i ps,   and we' I I   assert   t hat

11                t hose should - -

12                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     The problem is,   if   you  look --   as

13                you well   know,   if   you  look at   those exhibits,   it's

14                segments  of   the Waxman  hearing that   day.      I   think

15                they're actually an hour   each,   and there's  about   eight

16                of   them     So it   makes  basically the full   day.

17                          What   the problem is,   is  it's Ti sch within the one

18                hour   segment,   Camel   within another   hour   segment,   and

19                then you  have the Seven  Dwarfs  in another   hour

20                segment.     We call   t hem t he Seven  Dwarfs.

21                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     And  I   object   to that.     You're

22                talking about   the CEOs  of   the  major   corrpani es,   so

23                let's  use their   real   titles.     We  have objections with

24                regard t o t hose.

25                          What   I   want,   assuni ng the Court   is  overruling our 1559

1                obj ect ion wi t h  r egar d t o t hese,   is   I   think  IVT .   Yar ber

4                screen,   and we would expect   to see that   before it

5                appears.     There were couple of   exhibits that   hit   the

6                screen today that   we had not   seen --   we had  not   been

7                abl e t o pr evi ew.

8                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     One.

9                           IvR   TEPI Kl AN:     Three.     Yeah,   three.     And so we

10               would want   to be able to see that   to verify what   is

11                act ual I y

12                           IvR   Ul TERVWK:     And what   I'll   do i s  because  Robert

13                --   I ' m not   going to see  hi m unt i I   Sunday  afternoon.

14               We'I I   gi ve i t   t o you  IVbnday at   noon.     We'll   just   let

15                you  look at   t hem qui ckl y.

16                           IvR   BIGGER:     Hoi d on.      Is  it   going to be any

17               different   than anything i n t he other   case?    It's  going

18                t o be t he same clips from other   cases?

19                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Yeah.

20                           IVR.   BIGGER:     We're  not   recreating  new cl i ps.

21                           IVR.   YARBER:     We still   want   to see them

22                           IVR.   BIGGER:     That's fine.     Just   so the  record

23                it's  clear,   these defendants  --   and  I'm sure the

24                attorneys  have seen in  prior   cases  as well.     There's

25                nothing  new t hat' s  been edited or   created  here. 1560

1                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     The problem we  have,   the exhibit

2                I i st ,   as  i t   exi st s  now,   includes  eight   hours'   worth of

3                hearing,   and we just   need to know t he universe of

4               what's  going to be played.

5                           IVR.   BIGGER:     I   put   on the record the universe of

6               what's  going to be played.

7                          IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     But   we want   to see the universe of

8               what's  going to be played.

9                           IVR.   YARBER:     Just   to  make our   objection clear   on

10                the use of   these Waxman  hearings,   these are a year

11                af t er   IW .   W I I i s qui t   smoking.     They're  not   relevant

12                at   all   of   his  smoking  history.     They're  not   relative

13                to punitive damages or   punishment   because it's  all

14                after   anything that   could  have harmed  hi rn   so we

15                maintain none of   these should be played because it   has

16                zero relevance to this  case.

17                          THE COURT:     Understood.      I've considered these at

18                great   detail   at   great   length,   and  I'll   overrule the

19                obj ect i ons.

21                be the video deposition of   Dr.   Benowi t z and associated

22                exhibits.      I   don't   know what   that   is,   I   don't   know

23               what   they're intending to use,   but   they  need to

24                provi de us wi t h a I i 111 e more detail.

25                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     It's  not   going to be used. 1561

1                           IVR.   YARBER:     Ei t her   t hat' s  at ypo by  us  or   a t ypo

2                by you guys.

3                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Dr.   Benowi t z' s  deposi t i on  is  not

7                          IVR.   BIGGER:     I   will   not e t hat   it's  4007 right

10                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     Bot t om I i ne is  you do not   intend

13                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     We're  not   going to use  Benowi tz's

16                           MT.   YARBER:     Thi s  is  a Brown & Wl I i anrson

17               document   from 1971.     Relevance,   403,   because it   has

22                because he was  already smoking the brand.     So it   has

1                           THE COURT:     All   right.      I'll   overrule the

2                objection.     4051,   a federal   trade cormi ssi on  report   to

3                Congress dated  1957.

4                          MR.   BIGGER:     And there was  an earlier   one about

5                t he t ar   and  nicotine content;   this  is  a report   about

6                the advertising.     There was two with the same  here.

7                          THE COURT:     Who's  ar gui ng t hi s?

8                           MR.   YARBER:     Your   Honor,   I'll   object   to this.

11                absolutely  no relevance to this  case either,   but   it's

12                absolutely  hearsay.

13                          THE COURT:      M-.   Bi gger?

14                          MR.   BIGGER:     It's  public  records  exception,   Your

15                Honor.     There's  a public  records  exception to  hearsay.

16                This was done pursuant   t o t he  FCC s  authority to

1                being used --   and it   was just   used this week i n t he

2                Townsend case,   in which  FUR i s the defendant   without

3                objection whatsoever   during  Dr.   CumTi ngs'   testimony.

7                          MR.   Ul TERVWK:     Exact I y what   we' r e goi ng to do is

8                use clips,   which has  been done in the Gray case,   the

9                Carrpbel I   case,   the IVartin case,   the Townsend case,   and

10                I   think --   possibly the Naugl e case.

11                           MR.   BIGGER:     But   the point   was  is  he wasn't   on

12                the witness  list   sufficiently,   so what   has  been done

13                i n t he past   --   it   was  an depo exhibit.     They  noted

14               t hat   t hi s  i s  a procedure that's done i n t he past.     I

16                           I   just   know t hat   this week,   a f ew days  ago,

17                counsel   for   RJ.   Reynolds  in that   case made  no

19                during  Dr.   Cunrrri ngs'   deposition.

1                           THE (COURT:     Through  Dr.   Cunmri ngs?

2                           MR   Ul TERWK:     Correct.     Like in every  other

3              case.

4                          THE COURT:     Rem nd  me on  Monday.      I   wi I I   have

5                made a decision,   but   I   may  not   remember   t o put   it   on

6                t he  record.

7                          MR   TEPI Kl AN:     And,   Your   Honor,   we  had already

8                discussed,   I   think,   briefly,   the corrposite exhibit   of

9                advertising,   and  nry  understanding,   based on the

10                Court's  --   or   taken up earlier,   is that   they would be

11                removing any  of   the tabs.

12                           MR.   Bl QGER:     V\e di d.

13                           MR   TEPI Kl AN:     So it   would just   be the ads.

14                          THE COURT:     They  may  be tabs;   they just   can't

15                have the descriptions.

16                           MR   Ul TERVWK:     I   have t hem i n  my  room,   and  I'm

17                sorry  if   I   didn't   give t hem t o you.      11' s A,   B,   C,   and

18                D and  nunrbers.

19                           MR   YARBER:     And j ust   for   clarity,   I   don't   recall

20                from the argument   Monday afternoon whether   Your   Honor

21                ruled on the actual   adrri ssi bi I i t y of   those at   the

22                time.     You said you wouldn't   preadnit   t hem,   but   you

23               would consider   t hem when we argue t hem now.

24                          THE COURT:     Subject   t o t he foundation  laid by

25                Dr.   Cunmri ngs,   the objections  are preserved and 1565

1                over r ul ed.

2                           MR   TEPI Kl AN:     The onl y  ot her   t hi ng  I   woul d add,

3                Your   Honor,   as  I   said earlier,   we had filed objections

4               t o t he exhibits  they  intend to use wi t h  Dr.   Cunmri ngs.

5                11' s  a wr i 11 en subnri ssi on,   and we have i ncor por at ed

6                al I   of   those objections  as wel I   i nt o t he arguments

7               f rom t oday.

8                          THE COURT:     It's  in t he  record.     Al I   ri ght.

9                           MR   BIGGER:     I   apologize for   misleading you that

10                that   was going to go quickly.

11                           THE COURT:     That' s  f i ne.     My quest i on  is  t hi s:

12                I s  Dr.   Cunmri ngs'   documentation and exhibits  more

13                extensive than  most   witness's  --

14                          MR.   Bl GGER:     Yes.

15                          THE COURT:     - -   or   i s  t hi s  a f ai r I y  conmron  - -

16                           MR   BIGGER:     No,   he's  the most   extensive.

17                          MR   Ui TERVWK:     He's  by far   the  most   extensive.

18                Dr.   Benowitz,   I   t hi nk we have  16 or   17.

19                           MR   BIGGER:     Dr.   Benowitz  is  mostly demonstrative

20               wi t h onl y  a couple of   exhibits.

21                           MR   Ui TERVWK:     Four   or   five exhibits.

22                           MR   TEPI Kl AN:     Yeah,   Your   Honor,   I   think they're

23                correct   that   the way  I   see this  case unfolding with

24                Dr.   Cunmri ngs,   that   that   was  probably the bulk of   the

25                exhibits which would take the most   time.     I   guess  I 1566

1                should ask:     Is  Proctor   corning?    Because  Proctor   can

2                be a large --

3                           MR   Ui TERVWK:     No,   he's  already  been designated,

4                and there are exhibits  in there that   we already know

5                about.     And  I ' m goi ng to t el I   you:     I ' m not   cal I i ng

6                Proctor.

7                          MR   TEPI Kl AN:     I   was  onl y sayi ng  it   for   t he

8                st andpoi nt   of   t hat   woul d have been t aken a little bi t

9                of   t i me because of   the exhibits,   but   we have

10                designated the testimony.     So we're all   good with

11                regard to t hat.

12                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     One thing,   we have medi cal   got

13                records.     You can i magi ne wi t h al I   he' s  got   - -   t hat

14               you and  I   are just   agreeing on all   those.

15                           IVR.   TEPI Kl AN:     We  have agreed  --   we bot h  put   them

16                on the exhibit   list,   we both agreed t o t he medical

17                records.

18                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     There's  one issue  I   need to

19                resolve,   and that   i s  t he summary  of   his  medical   bills

20                from the VA.     Judge,   I   didn't   make an objection today,

21                but   this  is  an  issue.     As we know,   VA,   in fact,   has

22                bi I I ed us for   his  medi cal   bi I I s  and  has  cl ai med a I i en

23                on the proceeds  of   any  award  in this  case.

24                          So i t' s  part   of   our   instructions  about   how you  --

25                t he f act s  and t he VA and t hat   ki nd of   st uf f ,   ki nd of 1567

1                I i ke a collateral   source type thing or   IVedicare type

2                t hi ng.     But   we do  have a summary  of   t he  medi cal   bi I I s.

3                          And as  Bruce will   attest,   getting  medical   records

4                and  medi cal   bi I I s  out   of   t he VA i s  harder   t han get t i ng

5                gold out   of   Fort   Knox.     And we literally  are getting

6                t hem dai I y  r i ght   now.

7                          They  gave us,   for   instance,   up through October,

8                and just   today,   or   yesterday,   we got   just   IVarch.     But

9               we haven't   gotten  Novenrber   to  February,   and so that's

10                a moving target,   Bruce.

11                           IVR.   TEPI KI AN:     And we appreci at e t hat.     We

12                underst and t hat .

13                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     Ckay.     But   the summaries  are

14                r equi r ed to be gi ven at   a cer t ai n t i me bef ore t r i al .

15                I   can't   do t hat   i n t hi s  case.

16                           IVR.   TEPI KI AN:     We just   have to do the best   we

17                can.

18                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     We're  up to 339,000  now.

19                           IVR.   TEPI KI AN:     During the course of   the case

20                movi ng f or ward,   and obvi ousl y t here wi I I   reach a t i me

22                deci di ng t he case.

23                           IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     And we  I i t er al I y  - -   I   mean,   it's

24               the  most   unbelievable,   difficult   thing  I've ever   dealt

25               wi t h as  f ar   as  medical   records  are concerned in  nry 1568

1                life.

2                          THE COURT:     I ' m aware of   t he i ssue,   and you can

3               work that   out   as  best   you can going forward.     ivy

4               quest i on is  t hi s:     How I ong do you t hi nk

5                recognizing that   it   always takes  a little bit   longer

6                t han you ant i ci pat e - -   do you t hi nk t hat   Dr.   Benowi t z

8                           IVR.   BI QGER:     Have you seen t he e- mai I ?

9                           IVR.   TEPI KI AN:     I   have got t en t he e- mai I .      I

10                haven' t   seen i t .

11                           IVR.   BIGGER:     At   least   one of   the exhibits,   the

12                conrpany documents  that   we put   on the  list,   was  ruled

13                on already today,   so,   I   mean,   that   would be --

14                          IVR.   Ul TERVWK:     I   think actually  a couple.

15                There's  a Teague in there.

16                           IVR.   BIGGER:     Mere than one.     The  rest   are slides,

17                and they'll   be pretty  straightforward.     Stuff   you guys

18                have seen before,   stuff   from the generic deposition.

19                I   don't   t hi nk i t   will   be that   long.      I   would say

20                30 ni nut es  at   max.

21                           IVR.   TEPI KI AN:     I   don' t   t hi nk i t   wi I I   be t hat
