3     Plaintiff, first being duly sworn, testified as

4     follows: 5

6                       EXAMINATION BY MR. LANHAM:

7

8          Q   This is the deposition of Brendan McCormick in

9     the MDL Docket 19-MD-2068, In Re: Light Cigarettes

10     Marketing Sales Practices Litigation.

11                Mr. McCormick, we just met prior to the

12     deposition.  I'll introduce myself as Sam Lanham from

13     Bangor, Maine, with the firm of Lanham, Blackwell, and I

14     am representing the plaintiffs in the litigation.  How

15     are you today?

16           A   I'm well, and you?

17           Q   I'm fine, thank you.  You've had the

18     opportunity, I understand, to meet with your counsel

19     before the deposition, correct?

20          A   Correct.

21          Q   And did you review any documents?

22                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  Question calls for

23      privileged information.

2 4                         Q   Did you review any documents that you used for

25            purposes of preparing for the deposition?  I've not

3390538039

3990538039pgNbr=7
Page 7 |

i           asked you to identify the documents, ITm asking you if

2     you reviewed any documents.

3              MS. MILBUKNf:  He can answer yes or no.

4          A   Yes.

5              MR. LANHAM:  Are you going to not allow me to

6     ask him at all with regard to what documents he

7     reviewed?  I take the position that we're entitled to

8     know what he reviewed if it's in preparation for the

9     deposition.

10              MS. MILBURN:  I think what he may have

11     reviewed with counsel is privileged.  You can certainly

12     ask him with respect to particular documents, if he saw

13     them before, and you can ask him what he may have

14     reviewed on his own.

15          Q   Before you met with counsel today, did you

16     review any documents in preparation for the deposition?

17          A   Yes.

18          Q   What were they?

19          A   I reviewed a number of documents, for example,

20     that I prepared  used in preparation of the affidavit.

21          Q   Did you review anything other than the

22     document you used in preparing the affidavit?

23          A   Yes, there were probably a few other documents

24     that I reviewed.

25          Q   Would you describe them for me, please.

	A   I don't remember all of them specifically, but

2
	they were documents that were appropriate and relevant

3
	to the issues that were discussed in the affidavit.

4
	Q   You've had your deposition taken before.

5
	correct?

6
	A   I've been deposed just once before.

7
	Q   Just once before?  Okay.  Just so you and I

8
	are on the same page, as I ask you questions, I want to

9
	make sure that you understand my questions; if you don't

10
	understand it, I want you to tell me; is that fair?

11
	A   Yes.

12
	Q   And even though you may anticipate the answer

13
	to a question, please take the time to let me finish so

14
	the court reporter can take down everything.  You

15
	understand that?

16
	A   Yes.

17
	Q   You're currently, as I understand from your

18
	affidavit, vice president of corporate communications at

19
	Altria Client Services, Inc.?

20
	A   That's correct.

21
	Q   And I believe you began your work with Philip

22
	Morris USA in July of 1993 as an intern in the public

23
	affairs department?

24
	A    That'5 correct.

4          A   Thank you. 5

6                (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 1 is

7              marked.) 8

9                     Q   I'm at Paragraph 2.  I'm just getting some

10     background information, obviously.

11          A   Yeah.  I don't recall the exact date of my

12     appointment to director of media, director of the

13     department.

14          Q   When you say you held a number of increasingly

15     responsible positions, just tell me what you mean by

16     that.

17          A   I started as an intern, moved my way up

18     through the organization to coordinator specialist,

19     manager, and ultimately to director within that 2 0           department.

21          Q   Then from '04 to '06, you were director of

22     business development and planning for Philip Morris USA.

23     Tell me what your job responsibilities involved in that

24     position.

25                         A         It  included  speech writing  and presentation

Page 11

1     preparation for Philip Morris USA's senior executives

2     for public presentations for updates to employees.

3     There was some business analysis there and new business

4     development and analysis.

5          Q   Then in November of '06, you were named senior

6     director of corporate communications for Philip Morris

7     USA,  What were your responsibilities at that time?

8          A   In November of 2006, I supervised the media

9     relations department.

10          Q   You say you supervised the media relations

11     department as senior director of corporate

12     ccmmunications?

13          A   Yes.

14           Q   And you were then promoted, I gather, to your

15     current position in April of '08?

16          A   Correct.

17           Q   And what are your responsibilities as VP of

18     corporate communications at Altria Client Services,

19     Inc.?

20          A   I oversee the media relations department and

21     the departments that have responsibility for

22     communicating with employees, as well as our website and

23     some of our corporate advertising.

24          Q   Where are you located presently?

25          A   Richmond, Virginia.

1          Q   With regard to your affidavit, Mr. McCormick,

2     and specifically Paragraph 10, what information did you

3     use to prepare your statement that is contained in

4     Paragraph 10?

5          A   I reviewed information that summarized the

6     extent of our onsert production, as well as the number

7     of packs and the types of packs that the onserts were

8     included in at that period of time, so I reviewed those

9     documents for each of those years.

10           Q   When you state that, for example:  "In

11     November of 2002, the onsert was enclosed in

12     approximately 130 million packs," where would that have

13     been done in terms of the manufacturer?

14          A   It would have been done  Philip Morris USA

15     at the time had two primary manufacturing facilities,

16     one in Richmond, Virginia, and one in Cabarrus, North

17     Carolina.

18           Q   Where in North Carolina?

19          A    Cabarrus County, North Carolina.

20           Q   And that was done at that time by Philip

21     Morris USA?

22                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

23           Q   Was it done at the time by Philip Morris USA?

24          A   Is the question was the manufacturing of the

25     cigarettes done by Philip Morris USA?

3990538045

3990538045pgNbr=13
Page

1          Q   Yes.

2          A   Yesr it was.

3           Q   Did there come a point in time over the course

4     of  from 2002 until 2008 where that was no longer done

5     by Philip Morris USA?

6                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.  "That"

7     meaning what?

8                MR. LANHAM:  What we just referred to,

9     insertion of the onserts.

10           A   Manufacturing of the cigarettes was done by

11     Philip Morris USA.

12           Q   The inclusion of onserts in the packaging was

13     dene by whom?

14          A   I believe most of it was done during the

15     manufacturing process.  There may have been some that

16     were inserted after; I do not know for sure whether that

17     was done by Philip Morris USA.

18           Q   When you say that the onserts were enclosed in

19     approximately 130 million packs in November 2002, does

20     that mean that those packs were available for purchase

21      in convenience stores or other retail stores across the

22     nation during that month?

23           A   It may not have been exactly during that

24     month.

25 '        Q   Could have been spread over a period of time?

1           A   Yes, it could.  It would have been based on                 j

2     the distribution of how that product would flow through            j

3     the distribution system.                                                                                  |

4           Q   Would that product flow through the                                   |

5     distribution system vary depending upon the geographic

6     region?                                                                                                                       |

7           A   I think the way I would describe it is to say             jj

8     that the product with the onserts would flow through the

9     distribution system in the same way other cigarettes                   |

10     that we sold would flow through the distribution system.           |

11           Q   Okay.  Now, I'd like you to - I'm going to                 j

12     ask you a couple of questions in that regard to educate

13     me with regard to that process.  The cigarettes are                      j

14     manufactured, let's say, for example, here in Richmond,

15     Virginia.  Where do they go first in the chain of                          j

16     distribution?                                                                                                          |

17           A         They may go from our factory to a warehouse                 |

18     for storage, would typically be your first step.

19           Q   That would be local, as in the Richmond area?             |

20          A   I don't know exactly where all of the                              j

21     warehouses were located.  Some could go immediately                     

22     offsite to a location that's close to the factory.  We

23     also, then, have other public warehouses that we use for          | 2 4            storage, which I understand are around the country.                      I 25         Q   And then they go first to a warehouse, and                   j

1     where do they then go next?

2           A   They would go to a direct customer of ours.

3           Q   To a direct customer of Philip Morris USA?

4           A   Of Philip Morris USA.

5           Q   And give me just a couple of direct customers

6     in Virginia that you can think of by name, by way of

7     example would be.

8           A   I would give you an example of the type of

9     customers, if you would like me to.

10           Q    That's fine.

11           A   Which would typically be a wholesaler who

12     ordered the product, or perhaps a large retailer that

13     purchases directly from us.

14           Q   If it is a wholesaler, then what is the next

15      step in the chain of distribution?

16           A   In most instances it would likely be the

17     retail customers of that wholesaler.

18           Q    And a retail customer of the wholesaler would

19     be in the nature of a convenience store owner or a

20      supermarket owner and the like; is that correct?

21           A   Correct.  It would be those retail stores that

22      sell the product.

23           Q   The actual retail stores that sell the 2 4            product? 25          A    Correct.

3990538048

Page 16 |

1           Q   And then the last step in that chain is to the          f

2     customer, the smoking customer for purchase?                                     j

3           A   Correct.                                                                                               |

4           Q   Now, in terms of what you've just described                 |

5     from manufacturer to being in the possession of the                      f

6     retailer who sells to the customer, can you give us a                 f

7     sense of the time frame within which that process                          

8     generally occurs?  And I mean a range of time frame,                    |

9     like the minimum would be what, and the maximum would be          1

10     what, in your experience?                                                                               |

11          A   First let me say I'm not involved in managing

12     our distribution system, so I would give you that                          |

13      context in which to consider my answer..  It would depend          f

14     on the brands that you were talking about.  Brands that             j

15     move more quickly and have a higher sales volume could               |

16     move through  you know, the earliest is probably                        |

17     around two weeks.                                                                                                 f

18                And then for brands with less of a sales                        i

19     volume, it would build up from there.  I don't have a                 I

20      specific time frame around some of our other                                     *

21      slower-moving brands, but based on what I've heard from             I

22      others, it would be two weeks would probably be at the               j

23     earlier end of the faster moving brands.                                              f

24           Q   With regard to the slower moving brands, have             j

I

25     you heard anything to suggest that it could be as long               j

1     as   three months?

2          A   I don't know specifically.  I don't have

3     independent knowledge of that, and don't have direct

4     management responsibility for our distribution system.

5          Q    If in the chain of distribution the wholesaler

6     or large retailer already has inventory that does not 1            include the onserts, and now they are receiving in

8     shipment packages that do include the onsetrt, in 20 02

9     was there any process by which they were expected to put

10     their inventory with the onserts ahead, if you will, of

11     the? inventory without the onserts for purposes of

12     distribution ultimately to the smoking customer?

13          A   Not that I'm aware of.

14           Q   Are you aware of distribution agreements that

15     would exist between Philip Morris USA and wholesalers?

16          A   I'm aware that we have distribution agreements

17     or have agreements with many of our direct customers.

18           Q   And those direct customers for Philip Morris

19     USA would be wholesalers or large retailers, correct?

20          A         Typically, yes.

21           Q   Anyone else by category?

22           A   Not that I'm aware of.  I think those are the

23     primary categories that you'll see in our direct

24     customers.

25          Q   In your work over time, have you had occasion

17 t

3390538050

3990538050pgNbr=18
Page

1     to be involved with the preparation of such distribution

2     agreements?

3           A   No.

4           Q   Have you had occasion to read them so that you

5     would be familiar with them?

6           A   Yes.

7           Q   Based on your familiarity with them in that

8     context, do those distribution agreements that you were

9     familiar with contain provisions with regard to

10     specifically the subject of onserts?

11           A   I don't recall one way or the other.

12           Q   So you don't have any memory as to whether the

13     subject of packaging with onserts and their distribution

14     was in any way addressed within the body of the

15     distribution agreements; is that correct?

15                                  MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.

17           Q   Go ahead.

18           A    I do not recall the specifics of the

19     distribution agreements in regard to whether or not

20     onserts were included in any type of agreement that I

21     reviewed.

22           Q   Is there such a thing as a standard shelf life

23     of a package of cigarettes?

24          A   As I understand it, there may be guidelines

25     that are used.  And I think it would also depend on how

3390538051

3990538051pgNbr=19
Page 19

1      the product was stored, the conditions under which the

2     product was stored.

3           Q   Is there any  in your business, is there any

4      so-called standard shelf life, what is considered to be

5     a normal shelf life under normal circumstances?

6          A   That's not something I'm involved in from a

7     day-to-day basis, so I don't know the answer to that.

8           Q   Do you know if in 2002 and 2003 there were any

9     plans that were in place to get onserted packs of

10     cigarettes into retail stores at the same time?

11          A   Could you clarify that question, please.

12           Q   I certainly can.  If you have a number of 

13      strike that.

14                At the time that you have in place for certain

15     packaging  and we'll get to that a little bit later --

16     for distribution in, let's say for example, the fourth

17     quarter of 2002  that's the first reference you make

18     in Paragraph 10 of your affidavit  was there a plan in

19     place whereby that distribution of those approximately

20      130 million packs would occur at the same time in the

21     distribution network, or was it a plan that allowed for

22      a staggered distribution of those 130 million packs?

23                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

24          A   What I can do is explain to you kind of the

25     way in which the product moved through the distribution

3390538052

3990538052pgNbr=20
Page 2 0 f

1     system, which was the same way product would have moved            j

2     through -- all of the product would have moved through               |

3     the distribution system.  So that would have been based            |

4     on orders from wholesalers or other direct customers,                  |

5     and then based on orders from retailers.

6           Q    So it is based upon the orders of your large               f

7     retailers and your wholesalers?                                                                  |

8           A   For the first step of the process.                                     j

i

9           Q   So if you are beginning the distribution of                 j

10      the 130 million packs in November of 2002, that                              |

11     distribution is dependent upon the orders that are being

12     placed by the distributors and the large retailers?                      |

13                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  It mischaracterizes             j

14     what he said.                                                                                                          |

15           Q   Go ahead.                                                                                             |

16           A    The products that were inserted would have                   |

17     moved from our factory to wholesalers and other direct               f

18      customers when that product was ordered by them.                            I

19           Q    So it is driven, then, by the orders placed by          f

20      the wholesalers and retailers, large retailers, correct?           f

21           A         The movement of product from our possession to

22     the possession of wholesalers and direct customers would          f

23     be driven by them actually ordering the product from us.           |

24           Q   And was there any formal plan in place that                 I

25     established that process or is that just such a basic                 |

3390538053

3990538053pgNbr=21
Page

1     manner of doing business that no such formal plan is

2     needed?

3          A   Is the question as it relates to the onserts?

4          Q   No, itTs a guestion as is distribution in

5     general because you've said that the onserts is no

6     different, it's order  what I hear is it's order

7     driven.  So my question is simply is that something that

8     is so well known and basic to the industry that no

9     formal plan setting forth in writing what you just said

10     exists?

11              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.  I think

12     you're asking him an expert question.

13              MR. LANHAM:  I'm going to ask you, Nancy, if

14     you don't mind, to keep your objections to the form,

15     foundation or directing the witness not to answer.  No

16     further explanation, clarification is necessary, please.

17     Thank you.

18          Q    Let's see, I'm not asking the question very

19     well, be the first one to admit it.  What I am

20     interested in is simply knowing if the concept of the

21     distribution being order driven as such is something

22     that is so basic to the way business is done that no

23     formal written document as to that very concept is

24     necessary?

25          A   I'm not familiar with the processes.  I knowpgNbr=22
Page 22 |

1     that we have processes in place that govern the sale of

2     our products.  I haven't worked in that area so I'm not

3     familiar with how that works.  It seems that part of the

4     question is based on what that process  you know, we

5     sell the product, we manufacture a product and sell it

6     to those who order it.  And again, we have standard

1           processes that are in place that govern how that works.

8     And as you noted, they're the same as it was for these

9     -- this was handled the same way.

10           Q    I've been asking my questions so far, I've

11     been focusing pretty much on November of 2002, that time

12     frame.  Would your testimony be the same with regard to

13     the process being order driven through the second

14     quarter of 2008, which is the last time frame referenced

15     in your affidavit, Paragraph 10?

16           A   It's my understanding that the way we sell our

17     products is largely the same, and has remained largely

18     the same at the highest levels during that period of

19     t ime.

20           Q   So nothing fundamentally to your knowledge

21     changed in that time frame between 2002 and 2008?

22                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

23           A   To my knowledge, between 2002 and 2008, the

24     way in which our direct customers asked for and received

25     our product remained essentially the same.

1          Q   Now, once you have delivered the product to                |

2     your direct customers, which is to say wholesalers and

3     large retailers, at that point in time do you  and you          I

4     being Philip Morris USA  cease to have any control                  |

5     over the further distribution of the product?                                j

6          A   That product at that point in time is in their         j

7     possession.                                                                                                      |

8          Q    So however long they want to retain the                        |

9     product, store the product, or keep the product is                      j

10     entirely in their discretion; is that a fair statement?            |

11          A   I'm not sure if it is.  Some of it may be                    |

12     addressed by the agreements we have with our wholesalers          1

13     and our direct customers.                                                                         j

14          Q   Once the product makes its way through the                  j

I

15     distribution chain  and let me use, if I may, for an              |

16     example Wal-Mart, a Wal-Mart store that sells Philip                  !

17     Morris manufactured cigarettes  once it is into the                j

18     hands of the ultimate retailers, in my example,                            |

19     Wal-Mart, at that point does Philip Morris USA have any           |

20     control over how soon the product is sold?

21          A   To my knowledge we don't have control over how         f

22     the product is sold.  We do have agreements with                          |

23     retailers, certain retailers throughout the country                    j

24     related to certain aspects of the sale of our products.            f

25          Q   What about the aspect of how soon the product            jpgNbr=24
Page 24 |

1     is to be sold after being received by that particular

2     entity?

3          A   To my knowledge, I am not aware of specific

4     requirements that require them, for example, to sell the

5     product during a certain period of time.  I know that we

6     have done things throughout the distribution chain  I

7     am not familiar with all of them because that's not an

8     area that I work in  to rotate for product freshness.

9     There have also been instances where product that is not

10     fresh has been removed from the shelves after a certain

11     period of time.

12           Q    Is what you just described something that is

13     established between Philip Morris and the wholesaler or

14     between Philip Morris and what I'm going to call the end

15     retailer?

16          A    It may or may not be addressed.  I know we

17     have agreements in place with both direct customers, as

18     well as a number of retailers that participate in some

19     of our programs.  I'm not familiar with all of the

20     details of those agreements; however, there are

21     agreements that exist that may address some of these

22     issues.  But not being familiar with them, I can't give

23     you specifics on that.

24          Q    I understand, and I respect that.  Do you have

25     any familiarity at all in the context of such agreements

1     as to whether they address the subject of staleness or

2     rotation with packages that include onserts?

3           A   Could you ask the question again?

4                MR. LANHAM:  Well, I'll have her read it back.

5     The lights went out. 6

7                 (Court reporter read back previous

8                question.) 9

10                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

11           A   I am not aware of -- I believe you asked the

12     question earlier about anything specific to onserts, and

13     as I noted I was not aware of anything specific to

14     onserts.  And again I am not specifically familiar with

15     the elements of the agreement that may or may not

16     address how the product is rotated or whether that is in

17     the agreements or not.

18           Q    In Paragraph 12 of your affidavit, you mention

19      that in the beginning of the second quarter of 2009

20     information regarding descriptors, again, to appear on

21     the tear tape of packs of Light cigarettes, just in

22     terms of general background, what occurred that led 

23     how did it evolve to the point where that device,

24     communication device was used?

25                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

1           Q    You've been using onserts for a number of

2     years, and now in 2009 you begin to use tear tape on the

3     cellophane packaging.  What was the thinking generally

4     with regard to the evolution that led to using the tear

5     tape?

6                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

7          A   I think if you look at the range of our

8     communications over the years, we've regularly looked at

9     a variety of different tools.  It's my understanding

10     that at around the second quarter of 2009, we had the

11     ability and the option to include this message

12      specifically on the tear tape of the product, and that

13     was an option that we decided to pursue.

14           Q   When you say ability, do you mean in terms of

15     manufacturing?

16           A   Yes.  Putting that on the tear tape and

17     incorporating it into the manufacturing process.

18           Q    Is that to say that it became at least to some

19     extent a function of the manufacturing ability to be

20     able to do so?

21           A   That would have been one factor, and it would

22     have been an opportunity that would have been

23      identified.  What I don't know is -- I know that at that

24     point in time our manufacturing folks would have said,

25     yes, we have the ability to do this.pgNbr=27

1           Q   Why was not the tear tape mechanism used                        I

2     before 2009?                                                                                                          \

3          A    I don't know.                                                                                    |

4          Q   When was the first time that you became aware             j

5     of that as a possible device to be used to communicate               f

6     the descriptor language?                                                                                 j

7                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.                                          j

8          Q   When did you first become aware of the                            1

9     existence of tear tape being used?                                                           I

10           A    If the question is when did I become aware of             |

11     tear tape being used to communicate this message, is                   |

12     that your question?                                                                                             

13           Q   I'm even going back to prior to that,                               f

14     Mr. McCormick.  I'm not asking when it was first used on          |

15     packaging, I'm asking when you first became aware of it             f

16     even existing at all as a potential means to communicate          1

17     this message?                                                                                                          |

18          A   My recollection is that I would have become                 I

19     aware that we were using the tear tape to communicate                 |

20     about this message probably in early 2009.

21           Q   And you would not have been involved in any                 |

I

22     way prior to 2009 with regard to the development of that          I

23     vehicle?                                                                                                                     |

1          Q   So you have no knowledge  are you saying                  |

2     that you have no knowledge as to why it wasn't used

3     earlier?                                                                                                           |

4          A   I have no knowledge as to why it wasn't used             f

5     earlier.                                                                                                            |

6          Q   Once they started to be used in the second                 \ 1           quarter of 2009, did they replace onserts or were they              |

8     used together with  or did onserts continue to be used          jj

9     also?                                                                                                                 j

10          A   On this particular issue, in the beginning of            f

11     second quarter of 2009, the tear tape was the only                      1

12     method that we were using; we did not use onserts in                 j

13     2009.                                                                                                                  j

14          Q   What about so far in 2010?                                                  j

15          A   I do not believe we have used onserts to                      \

16     communicate these messages in 2010.                                                     |

17          Q   Paragraph 10 of your affidavit stated  the              j

18     last phrase refers to the second quarter of 2008, the                I

19     onsert was enclosed in 127 million packs.  Is that the

20     last quarter in which onserts were used in packaging?                j

21          A   To my knowledge that's the last quarter in                  j

22     which onserts were used to communicate a low tar                          |

23     message.                                                                                                            \

24          Q   All right.  Paragraph 12 says beginning in the         j

25     second quarter of 2009 you began to use the tear tape;              \pgNbr=29
Page 29

1     any other quarters in 2009 or just the second?

2          A   I believe that has been  we began in the

3     second quarter of 2009, and that information is still on

4     the packs.  So all of the packs after 2009 that bear

5     "Lights" or certain other brand descriptors have

6     included that language on the tear tape.

7          Q        All packs that we referred to as "Lights"

8     starting in the second quarter of 2009 and continuing

9     through the rest of 2 009 used them?

10          A    Correct.

11          Q    Is the same true with regard to so far in

12     2010?

13          A   That's my understanding.

14              MR. LANHAM:  Could we go off the record for a

19          BY MR. LANHAM: :

20          Q   Mr. McCormick, are you familiar with the

21     phrase that has been used in your marketing materials

22     since 2001 and 2002, that the amount of tar and nicotine

23     will vary depending on how you smoke?

24          A   That's similar to the language that's in the

25     Exhibit D.pgNbr=30

1          Q   Exhibit D to your affidavit?                                                 \

I

2          A   We said "the amount of tar and nicotine you                 j

3     inhale will vary depending on how you smoke the                              j

6     that while we took a break, defense counsel asked that               1

7     we include the exhibits to Mr. McCormick's affidavit as             1

8     part of the exhibit, and I had no objection to that, of             I

13           Q   This is my Exhibit D.  You're looking at the               f

14     bottom, it's very difficult to read:  The amount of tar             1

16     vary depending on how you smoke the cigarette; is that               f

5     full-flavored cigarettes, does it?                                                           j

6           A    The statement tells smokers that the amount of          I 1            tar and nicotine they inhale will vary on how they smoke          1

8     the cigarette.                                                                                                        I

9           Q   Right.  Are there any references made in the               j

10     advertising to tell smokers that they may get as much or          |

Is

11     more tar and nicotine as they would in smoking a                            1

i

12     full-flavored cigarette?  That's a different question.               \

13           A   What the advertisements do is direct smokers               j

14     to the website where they can find more information, and          j

15     there's extensive information on a range of issues on                 f

16      this that they can find on our website..                                                  jj

17           Q   And I hear you, but that's not my question.                  |

18     My question is, do these ads tell smokers, again, that               f

19     they may get as much or more tar and nicotine as in                     f

20      smoking full-flavored cigarettes?                                                             I

21          A   As I noted, the ad tells smokers:  "The amount

22     of tar and nicotine you inhale will vary depending on                 j

23     how you smoke the cigarette."

24           Q   But it doesn't say or doesn't indicate that                 j

25     there's the possibility that you may get as much or more          I

20      seen this letter?                                                                                                 |

1     and this is not a question, it's intended to create kind

2     of the setting.  We have been allowed to take some

3     additional discovery under limited circumstances for a

4     limited time by order of the court, so defense counsel

5     have been providing us with information, and we've been

6     provided information as recently as last night.

7                So I'm going to show you a letter, and what

8     I'd. like to do to help focus the question  and this is

9     Exhibit 2, and it is Judith Bernstein-Gaeta's letter to

10     Dawn Barrett, Joe Whatley and to me dated March 11,

11     2010.  And ITm going to highlight a couple of things and

12     then provide it to you, and I'll ask you a question

13     about it. 14

15                 (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 2 is

16                marked.) 17

18           Q    I'll hand you the letter.  And the letter

19     references several Excel spreadsheets that she has

20     provided because I've not had the physical ability to

21     print out the spreadsheets, which are voluminous.  I

22     don't have those with me here this morning; I do have

23     the letter, however.  And in Page 2, the top of the

24     letter, if you could refer to it along with me, please.

8     the reason that I got the letter late last night, and I            1

9     think that's fair.  This is a document in production                  1

10     that  if it had some time beforehand, I can understand         I

11     that.                                                                                                                  |

12              MS. MILBURN:  We don't consent to go off the              f

17     with me where I've highlighted in yellow in the top                    f

18     paragraph:  "From 2004 on, Philip Morris USA has the                  |

19     ability to track onserted packings as they are                              I

20     distributed to its direct customers, which is reflected           |

21     in this spreadsheet.  Thereafter, Philip Morris USA's                I

5              Are you with me so far?

6          A   I'm reading along with you.

7          Q   Do you agree with her representation that

8     Philip Morris USA does not have the ability to track

9     with mathematical precision the actual distribution of

10     onserted product by state?

11              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

12          A   I don't think I would agree with how that

13     was 

14          Q    I 

15          A   I don't think you're characterizing  that

16     you're saying what she's saying here.

17          Q   She's indicated in so many words that it

18     cannot be tracked with mathematical precision, and we

19     have therefore, quote, provided an estimate.  Do you

20     concur with her representation that those numbers can

21     only be provided by way of an estimate?

22              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form and

23     foundation.

24          A   The way I read this is she is saying that

25     Philip Morris USA from 2004 on had the ability to trackpgNbr=36
Page 36

1     onserted packings as they were distributed to direct

2      customers-  I have not seen the document and the

3      spreadsheet that you're looking at, wasn't involved in

4     the preparation of this document, but it seems like that

5     information is, she says, is reflected in the

6      spreadsheet.

7                What it seems to be saying is from that point

8     on, the company cannot track to the retail level with

9     the same mathematical precision.  And because we cannot

10      track with the same precision from wholesale to retail,

11     this seems to indicate that she's providing an estimate.

12           Q   An estimate with regard to the distribution

13      state by state?

14                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

15          A   She said we're providing an estimate of the

16      subsequent statewide distribution that's based on each

17     direct customer's current percentage of annual reported

18      sales of all packings into those states.

19           Q    Those four states are four states that are

20     involved right now with the current litigation.

21           A   I don't know which four states they are.

22           Q   I can tell you just so you know, they're

23      Illinois, Maine, California, and the District of

24     Columbia.

25                Do you know if Philip Morris USA has the

14     referred to in your affidavit, for November of 2002; do            |

15     you understand that?                                                                                   f

18          Q   Yes.  In this correspondence you mentioned in           f

19     your affidavit, Paragraph 10, November of 2002, this                  1

22          A   Yes.  I believe this is one of the documents              1

23     or document like it that I would have reviewed in                        I

2          A    Correct.

3           Q   And it indicates there were 175 packings, and             

4     the pack quantity was 131,244,500, which comports with               

5     your approximation of 130 million, doesn't it?                                |

6          A   That is correct.                                                                             |

7          Q   Now, it refers to A, B, C and D Brands, and                 f

8     documents that we'll be looking at today break down                     

9     brands by those letter categories.  Would you explain,                j

10     please, the distinction of an A Brand, a B Brand, a C                 f

11     Brand and a D Brand?                                                                                          |

12           A   I'll start by giving my understanding that                   j

13     those are terms that are used within our manufacturing               |

14     organization, so they're not terms that I deal with in               j

15     my day-to-day job.  But my understanding is that within            |

16     our manufacturing organization, they use those classes               |

17     of brands to describe different categories of cigarette             {

18     packings primarily based on their sales volume, with A               |

19     and B Brands being those with the largest sales, or in               i

20     their context production volume, and C and D Brands                      f

21     having a smaller production volume.                                                          I

22           Q    Do you know how they're further broken down                 f

23     between A and B and then C and D?                                                             |

24           A    I do not know precise distinctions.  I believe          I

25     that it flows from A being those with the highest volume          1pgNbr=40

1     and production quantities required, B being the second,             j

2     C being next, and D following below that.                                             I

3           Q    On the left-hand column of this document on                 I

"X :1

4     Page 1, it refers to one week's worth of average weekly            \

5     sales volume per SKU.  SKU is an acronym for stock                       \

6     keeping unit, isn't it?                                                                                    |

7           A   That's my understanding.                                                            f

8           Q   You're familiar with that term?                                            f

9           A   I'm familiar with that term.                                                   j

10          Q   Would you explain what is meant by one week's             \

11     worth of the average weekly sales volume per SKU?                          \

12          A   It's my understanding  and I didn't create               \

13     this document  that in preparing to look at the                          I

14     onserts, it was an estimate that we made based on                          f

15     historical sales volume for each of these SKUs.                               f

16           Q   What is the time frame of that historical                      j

17      sales volume that you used for purposes of making that               I

18     determination?                                                                                                        |

19          A   .1 don't know, I wasn't involved in making that

20      specific determination.

21          Q    It does not refer to one week in terms of the             \

22     calendar, like from November 10 to November 17, does it?          |

23                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to the form.                                 |

24          A   Again, I was not involved in the preparation               I

25     of this, but if you look at average weekly sales volume,           |

3990538073pgNbr=41
Page

1      I imagine you would use the average based on your sales

2     volume per week.  I was not involved in the preparation

3     of this.

4           Q    And perhaps a poor question.  When it says one

5     week's worth, that is an average of sales for one week

6     using some time frame upon which to make that average,

7     correct?

8           A   Yes.  It's my understanding that you would

9     look at your weekly sales over time, you would average

10     that and come up with roughly one week's worth of volume

11     based on that number.

12           Q   So if by way of example, and it's a

13     hypothetical, in one week -- and this is a very

14     artificially low number  but by way of illustration,

15     if your average for one week of sales was 1,000 packs,

16     then this would reflect a distribution of onserts in

17      1,000 packs to comport with the one week of average

18      sales?

19                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

20           A   My understanding is that we would rely on

21      that.  If one week's average sales volume was 1,000

22     packs, onserts would be put on 1,000 packs for that

23     particular SKU.

2 4                       Q   Thank you.  And then per SKU, put that in

25            context for me, please.  When it says per SKU, what doespgNbr=42

1     that mean in language that, you know, a layperson would             j

2     understand?                                                                                                              f

3           A   My understanding of SKU is that each                                j

4      individual different product offering with different                   j

5     cigarette pack would be an individual SKU.                                          f

6           Q   Is that to say each one of these line items

7     would be an individual SKU?                                                                           |

8          A   That's my understanding.  So you would look                 f

9     at  you would likely have 175 different packings, my               I

10     understanding is that that would be similar to an SKU.               f

11           Q   Which is to say 175 SKUs?                                                         I

12           A   That's my understanding, those terms would be             {

13     used similarly.                                                                                                      f

14           Q   Now, on the left-hand side it says included

15     packings, and on the right-hand side it says excluded                 |

16     low tar packings.  Do you have an understanding as to

17     why you have some that are included and some that are                 j

18     excluded?                                                                                                              \

19           A   I do not.  I wasn't involved in the                                   |

20     manufacturing operations at that time.  So my                                   |

21     understanding is on the left side  I agree that the                 j

22      left side you have included packings, and on the right               |

23      side seems to be excluded packings.                                                         f

24           Q   And I fully understand that you weren't

25      involved in the manufacturing process.  When I askpgNbr=43

	Page 43

1
	questions like that, I'm asking you based on the

2
	totality of your education experience with the company.

3
	And in that context, do you have any understanding as to

4
	why there are some that are excluded and yet they're low

5
	tar?

6
	A   I do not.

1
	Q   On the left-hand side, the included packings,

8
	what I'd like to do is just run down some names to see

9
	if I have them correctly because these are abbreviated,

10
	and I'll go down the list, then ask if I have it

11
	correctly.  And if there's something I don't know what

12
	it is, I'll ask you.  Do you understand?

13
	A   I understand.

14
	Q   Alpine, B & H is Benson & Hedges, Basic, Best

15
	Buy, Bristol, Bronson, Bucks, Cambridge, Dave's, Genco,

16
	Generals, Lark, Marlboro, Merit, No Frills, Parliament,

17
	Players, Premium Buy, and I believe the last is Virginia

18
	Slims.

19
	A   That would be consistent with my

20
	understanding.

21
	Q   Then within the Lights, the LTs, we have UL,

22
	which means Ultra Lights, correct?

23
	A   That's my understanding.

24
	Q   And MED is for Medium; is that true?

25
	A    That's my understanding.

1           Q   If you take a look at the fourth page in the

2     middle, you'll see the brand Players, and there's an FF.

3     I understand FF to mean Full Flavor; is that correct?

4          A    That's my understanding.

5           Q    Do you have an understanding of why a

6     full-flavored cigarette would be listed in the column of

7     Lights?

8                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

9           A   I do not.  What this would be would be the

10     codes that are used to identify the product.  What I do

11     not know is what the reported tar and nicotine yields

12     would be for that specific product.

13           Q   So that is to say that there's the possibility

14     that a product that is identified as a Players FF might

15     have a tar and nicotine level such that it is considered

16     to be a low tar and nicotine cigarette?

17          A   I believe that would be possible, that the

18      identifiers here which are the internal and ordering

19     identifiers that people would use to order those

20     products or manufacture them, some of those products may

21     have been within a definition that was below perhaps 15

22     milligrams of tar.

23           Q    And speaking of that, Philip Morris considers

24     any cigarette that is below 15 milligrams of tar to be a

25     low tar product, correct?

2           Q   And would you expect a similar document to

3     exist for each of the quarters that are referenced in

4     Paragraph 10 of your affidavit?

5          A.   In terms of a summary, I would expect that I

6     have reviewed a summary document of our inclusion of

7     onserts for each of the quarters that I mentioned in the

8     affidavit.

9          Q    Similar to Exhibit 3?

10          A   They would have been similar in terms of types

11     of information they would provide, yes. 12

14                marked.) 15

16           Q   Let me show you what is marked as Exhibit No.

17     4.  You'll see, Mr. McCormick, that in the upper

18     left-hand corner, very top, "2002 4Q Actuals," that's

19     referring to the fourth quarter of 2002, correct?

20          A   That's what it appears to refer to.

21           Q   Would you agree with me that this document

22     shows the number of packs for each SKU in which onserts

23     were placed in 2002?

24          A    I don't know.  If you don't mind, I believe

25     this is the first time I've seen this document.

Q   Can you answer the question?

A   Can you repeat the question?

Q   Certainly.  Do you agree this document shows the number of packs per SKU that included onserts for the fourth quarter of 2002?

A I don't know the origin of the document. It appears that it references onsert quantities. This is the first time I've seen it. I'm not sure who created this document and in what context it was created.

Q   Fair enough, but I didn't ask you that.  The last column indicates, does it not, pack onsert quantity, and it's listed per SKU, right?

A   That is what it appears to show, yes.

Page 4 a look at that, please.  This is a document  I

probably should have been referring to Bates numbers,

but the total Bates number is AC5000979757.  It's a

document that has a descriptor at the top of "Low Tar

Communication."  This document  have you had a chance

to look at it now?

A   Yes.

Q   The document in the lower left-hand corner, Mr. McCormick, is dated September 11 of 2005, but it appears to contain information that pertains to the 2002 low tar onsert program.  Do you see that?

MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  To the extent Exhibit 5 is part of a larger document, I would object to showing him just one page.  And I believe the same objection may apply to Exhibit 4, which also looks like it may be part of a larger document.

MR. LANHAM:  Objection is noted.

Q   Go ahead.  Do you have an understanding as to why there's the date of September 11, 2005, in the lower left-hand corner, and it looks to appear to pertain to the 2 002 program?

A    I do not.  This is not a document I've seen before,

A   I would assume that it does, but not having created the document, I'm not sure.  But that would be a typical way to refer to units.

Q   Unit would mean one individual cigarette, correct?

A    That would be ray understanding, is how we use that term.

Q   And that term is also used  I believe I've seen documentation that a cigarette is referred to as a

11
	stick; is that true?
	

12
	A   That would be another way that various
	
13
	entities track that.  We typically would use unit more
	
14
	often than not.
	
15
	Q   But if we see unit or we see stick, that
	
16
	refers to an individual cigarette as opposed to a
	
17
	package or a carton?
	
18
	A    Those terms would typically refer to
	
19
	individual cigarettes, correct.
	
20
	Q   So if there's 20 cigarettes in a pack, right?
	
21
	A    The vast majority of packs are sold in packs
	
22 23
	of 20.

Q   Under details, it says:  One week's shipment, Philip Morris low tar products, and then under timing, that's  strike that.

You see where it says under Details, one week's shipment, that comports with what we just referred to in an earlier exhibit as the one week average  one week's worth of average weekly sales volume for SKU, doesn't it?

A   Again, not having been familiar with this document, I don't know who the author is or in what context it would be there.  I would stick with what I referred to in the documents that I reviewed.  That's what I'm most comfortable talking to.

1     asking you based upon what we've gone and looked at

2     before, that you'd testify in that context.  And I

3     recognize -- you don't have to keep telling me that you

4     haven't seen this, you didn't prepare it; that's a

5     given, and I acknowledge it.

6                Timing on the far right column, you see where

7     it says:  Public Warehouse, October 21, 2002?

8          A    I do see that.

9           Q   What is a public warehouse, would that be what

10     you were referring to earlier?

11          A    I mentioned earlier that the product leaves

12     our manufacturing facilities and would go to public

13     warehouses around the country.

14           Q   And the reason I'm asking the question is you

15     may have mentioned the word "public," but I did hear you

16      say earlier "warehouse," and here they speak of public

17     warehouses.  Is it the same thing?

18           A   What I referred to earlier  they would leave

19     our facility and potentially go to our own warehouses.

20     When I referred to warehouses that were located around

21     the country, that would be the equivalent of public

22     warehouses.

23           Q   Indeed you did.  All right.  When it next says

24     Wholesale, November 4th, 2002, do you gather from this

25     that from the time that it got to the public warehouse

1     on October 21, 2002, that it makes it to wholesale by

2     November 4th, 2002?

3                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  He says he hasn't

4     seen this document before.

5                MR. LANHAM:  I understand.  You've made your

6     objection.

7          A   Yeah, I haven't looked at this document

8     before, so I don't know exactly what they're referring

9     to.  I described the distribution channel earlier.

10           Q   Let me  a broader stroke here, okay.  You've

11     described for me, and I appreciate it, the distribution

12      system, okay.  And now I have a document that appears to

13     comport with the same 130 million packs distributed in

14     November of 2002 per your affidavit, and it further

15     appears in the column on the right-hand side, far right,

16     that the timing of that distribution was from the point

17     of public warehouse, October 21, 2002, to actual retail,

18     was over a period of November 18th, 2002, to January

19      2003; do you understand that? 2 0                         A   I understand that that's what the document

21     has, information related to that.

22           Q   And do you agree that the document would

23      suggest that there is a time frame from distribution to

24     the public warehouse to the end date of retail of

25     January of 2003, at least on the face of the document?

3              MR. LANHAM:  I didn't ask him that.  We don't

4     need you to keep qualifying your objections.  Form,

5     foundation, instructions not to answer are appropriate.

6          Q   My question is, on the face of this, does that

7     appear to be the case?

8          A   It appears to be the case that this lays out

9     rough time lines for the distribution of that product

10     through the distribution system.  That's all I can tell.

11          Q   And that's really all I'm interested in.  And

12     if you make that assumption, it's roughly a six- to

13     ten-week time frame.  They have retail here in November

14
	18th, '02, to January '03, so that would be in a range

15
	of six to ten weeks?

16
	MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

17
	Q   Do you agree?  Based upon 

18

19
	January of '03.

1     think I have two  I have two there.  This is a similar

2     document, Mr. McCormick, as to Exhibit No. 3, this time

3      it's for the fourth quarter of 2003.  Do you see that?

4           A   I do.

5           Q   And you see where on the right-hand side the

6     pack quantity for this quarter is 111,700,. 000?

7          A   Yes.

8           Q   And in your affidavit you said for the fourth

9     quarter of 2003, the onsert was enclosed in

10     approximately 109 million cigarette packs, didn't you?

11           A   I did.

12           Q   Now, on the left-hand side of Exhibit No. 6,

13     under "Packings" at the top, you see where it says "45

14     non-full-flavor packings"?

15          A   I do.

16           Q   And again, that is a reference to the 45

17     different SKUs per line item as listed on the document,

18      correct?

19           A   That would be my understanding, that it refers

20     to those included packings down the left-hand side.

21           Q    Now, in November of 2002, the packings were

22      175, and in the fourth quarter of 2003, they were 45.

23     Do you have an explanation as to why the drop from 175

24      in 2002 to only 45 in 2003?

25                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

1           A   My recollection is that in fourth quarter

2     2003, there was some issues related to our manufacturing

3     processes.  I don't know the specifics of those.  But I

4     think if you look at what the difference was between

5     November of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003, it was

6     a difference between 130 million packs and approximately

7     109 million packs, or as this document says, 111 or 112

8     million packs.

9           Q    Could that be possibly because more packings

10     that included onserts was with regard to the A and B

11     Brands?

12                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

13           A   Could what be?

14           Q   The fact that you have a drop from 175

15     packings to 45 packings from '02 to '03, and your

16     numbers are roughly 130 million down to 111 million.

17           A   Based on my review of this document, it

18     appears that the 45 packings that are mentioned, without

19     an indication here whether they are A or B Brands,

20     certainly appear to be our largest volume brands, and

21     the fact that on 45 packings, we had over 111 million

22     packs distributed would indicate that those were likely

23     to be on those larger selling brands.

24           Q    All right.  And it follows from that that if a

25     smoker in the fourth quarter of 2003, 2003, smoked a low

3390538088

3990538088pgNbr=56
Page

1      tar cigarette that was not listed on Exhibit 6, that

2     that smoker would not have been purchasing a package

3     that contained an onsert, correct?

4           A         The brands that are listed in the included

5     packings would be the ones that contained the onserts,

6     so smokers who purchased those packs would have a pack

7     that included that onsert.

8           Q    And the other 130 packings would not have

9     included onserts during that time frame, correct?

10           A    The only ones that included the onsert were

11     the 45 packings.  I don't exactly know how many packings

12     we had that we were selling at that time.

13           Q         I'm simply subtracting the 175 from the fourth

14     quarter of 2002, I'm subtracting from that the 45 in the

15     fourth quarter of 2003, I come up with 130.

16           A   And my answer is 

17           Q   You would agree with me that  she's doing

18     that because I haven't asked the question yet -- you

19     would agree with me that there's a difference of 130

20     packings?

21                MS. MILBURN:  Mr. Lanham, I'm going to object

22     because the version of Exhibit 6 that you were using is

23     different than the version of Exhibit 6 that was

24     produced to you.  It appears to be a line that has been

25     whited out, which is the subject matter of the witness's

Page 57 testimony.  So I would just ask that we use the version

that was produced.

MR. LANHAM:  Let's go off the record, please.

(Discussion off the record.)

MR. LANHAM:  Let the record reflect that with regard to Exhibit No. 6, the copy that I had had a very faintly noted line under the word "classes" on the right-hand side that we just learned had not been picked up on photocopying on the copy being used by Mr. McCormick, so we've substituted it.  And the line at issue is underneath the word "classes," is the language "A & B packings only due to factory onserting capability."

Q   So you had testified  ITm going to ask you a question now  you testified earlier you thought it had to do with something concerning manufacturing, and you were right, weren't you, because of that?

A   What this document says is that production was limited to A and B packings only, and the rationale that's given in this document it was due to factory onserting capabilities, so it's a little bit more specific in terms of what the factors were that were impacting this, which were factory onserting capability.

1           Q   When these documents  and when I say these

2     documents, Mr. McCormick, I'm referring right now to

3     Exhibit 3, fourth quarter of November 2002, and Exhibit

4     6, fourth quarter of 2003.  When they refer to the

5     volume indicated for the fourth quarter of each of those

6     years, does that mean that there is no distribution of

7     packages with onserts for the other three quarters of

8     those same years?

9          A    In my affidavit I noted when these low tar

10     messages were distributed on onserts.  During other

11     portions of the year, we included other messages over

12     time that would typically be done on a quarterly basis.

13           Q   That's in the context of your overall onsert

14     program, which includes the corporate responsibility

15     piece that we'll talk: about.  But with, regard to actual

16      low tar onserts, it is limited in each, of those years to

17     the quarters mentioned in your affidavit; is that

18      correct?

19           A    That is my understanding, yes.

20           Q   And even further within that limitation, it is

21      limited to either a one-week sales volume distribution

22     for A and B Brands, and a two-week for C and D Brands,

23     correct?

24          A   For certain quarters, one week for A and B

25     brands, and two weeks for  I'm not sure if it's

1     universally true across these.  As you note for 2002, it

2     was one week's worth of average weekly sales volume.

3     For other quarters I understand that A and B Brands were

4     one week's worth of volume, and the C and D Brands for

5     two weeks of average weekly sales volume. 5

8                marked.) 9

10           Q    I'm going to show you what's been marked as

11     Exhibit No. 7.  This is a document, Mr. McCormick, that

12     was provided to us, I think, two days ago by the same

13     attorney that I mentioned earlier, Judith

14     Bernstein-Gaeta.  It purports to be a chart that goes

15     back to the fourth quarter of 2004 with regard to the

16     packaging that is mentioned.

17                Take as much time as you need to familiarize

18     yourself with it.  But my first question is, do you

19     agree that the document purports to indicate the total

20     number of packs with onserts shipped by year and quarter

21     to California, District of Columbia, Illinois and Maine?

22                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, foundation.

23          A    I'm not familiar with this document, so I

24     don't know what it purports to show.

25          Q   Do you see that it refers to packs shipped in

390538032

3990538092pgNbr=60
Page 60 |

1      four different jurisdictions?

2           A   I see that/ yes.

3           Q   Do you see that it is separated out by

4     different quarters in different years for low tar?

5          A   I see that they're labeled "low tar," but I'm

6     not familiar with this document, so I'm not comfortable

7     telling you exactly what it purports to show.  I'm not

8      sure the circumstances under which it was created, so

9      I'm not comfortable talking to it.

10           Q    That's a real fair answer, and it's also a bit

11     of a dilemma because it's what was provided to me by the

12     counsel who represent your company.  And so I have to

13     ask questions about what they provided.  So I want to

14     proceed with that understanding.

15                I know, and I hear you, that you've never seen

16     it, so you don't know how it came to be prepared.  So

17     let's proceed, if we can, just to talk about what it

18     purports to say on its face.  Is that fair?

19                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

20           Q   Is that fair?  Just a second.  Between you and

21     me, as far as a way to proceed with that understanding,

22     is that okay?

23           A   What I want to do is do my best to answer your

24     questions.  I am not comfortable answering questions

25     about a document that I don't know anything about.  So I

3390538033

3990538093pgNbr=61
Page 61 J

1     hope you understand that.

2                This is one that I haven't seen, and because

3     of that/ I don't know the answer  I can't answer

4     really anything about this document.  That's  you

5     know, I want to do my best to be as responsive as I can

6     to your questions.  The questions you've asked so far

7     about this document, not having any knowledge as to how

8     it was put together, I'm just simply not in a position

9     to answer.  So I hope you forgive me for not  I don't

10     want to speculate on something that I really don't know

11     anything about.

12           Q   Would you go so far to agree with me that on

13     the face of it, it has numbers and percentages for packs

14     shipped to California, District of Columbia, Illinois

15     and Maine for the quarters and the years indicated?

16          A   I see there's a label, "Pack Shipped."  I see

17     there's a label for each of those states.  I see there's

18     the percentage of the total.  Again, without knowing

19     what total program refers to or what numbers were used

20     here, I'm just simply not in a position to respond

21      intelligently to the document.

22           Q   If you take a look, please, by way of

23      comparison to your affidavit in Paragraph 10, in the

24     third sentence, you state, "In the fourth quarter of

25      2004, the onsert was enclosed in approximately 118pgNbr=62

4          A   I see that column and those numbers.

5          Q   Do you know how those classes are determined?

8     that as to --

9           A   I've testified to the extent of my knowledge

10     on that.

13           A   I think I answered earlier about my

16     how are they determined?

17           A   As I said earlier, I don't work in the

18     manufacturing operations.  So as I said earlier, it's my

19     understanding that those categories are used within our

20     production environment to guide production of those

21     products and classify them roughly by volume sold.  But

22     it's used, is my understanding, in a production context.

5           Q   Simply, can you tell us what the ad test

6     concept is about?

7           A   What I can tell you is what I read from this

8     document, which as I mentioned I don't think I've seen

9     before.  This appears to be a summary of focus groups

10      that were conducted in -- let me see if these list when

11     they were conducted  it would be some time prior to

12      the date of this document, which is dated April 2nd,

13      2003.

14           Q   And if you take a look at the second page, it

15      states that, at least in the context of this document,

16     the research objectives were to "Test developed

17     advertising concepts to qualitatively explore message

18     breakthrough;" in parens, "Does the ad communicate that

19     PMUSA is addressing tobacco issues?"

20                Given your position, is that something that

21     Philip Morris does from time to time with regard to

22      certain issues, certain marketing matters, and that is

23      to test whether a message is getting through that's done

24     by focus groups, right?

1          A   I would say what this appears to be and would

2     certainly not be unusual would be if you viere  going to

3     run television advertising, before you would run that

4     advertising, you would test it to get some reaction to

5     it to make sure it was accomplishing what you'd hoped it

6     would do.

7          Q   Because the converse is true, if it's not

8     going to accomplish what you hope to do, then that's a

9     good indication not to do it, correct?

10          A   You would prefer to learn as much about

11     reaction to those ads prior to them running, and focus

12     groups would be one of the ways in which to do that.

13          Q   On the third page with regard to this

14     particular focus group project, where it says

15     "Methodology," it involved conducting ten mini focus

16     groups and two traditional size focus groups in two

17     markets, San Francisco and Los Angeles, with opinion

18     leaders and general public.  You're familiar with the

19     whole focus group process, aren't you?

20          A   I'm familiar generally with how focus groups

21     are conducted, and I've attended various focus groups

22     over the years.

23          Q   When it says "10 mini focus groups and 2

24     traditional size focus groups," what does that tell you?

25          A    I don't know.pgNbr=73

1          Q   You looked at  it's Bates stamped 1433, the            f

2     last numbers, entitled "Executive Summary:  Overall                    |

3     Campaign.  People want to know ..."  Do you see that?                I

4          A   Yes.                                                                                               |

5          Q   Okay.  It states, "Executive Summary:  Overall          

6     Campaign.  People want to know why," and "why" is in                 f

7     quotation marks, "Philip Morris USA is communicating                 

8     what are perceived as counter intuitive messages."                      I

9              And there's a further indentation with the                  f

10     following:  Some respondents received the message,                      |

11     quote, don't smoke, closed quote, from the concepts,                  I

12     which leads to discussions of, quote, hypocrisy, closed            |

:

13     quote.                                                                                                                |

14              Then another bullet item:  "Without context                f

15     for the communications, many are skeptical and cynical."          I

16              Do you have any familiarity with or                                |

17     understanding as to what occurred in that regard in this          f

18     particular campaign?                                                                                   |

19              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.                                      |

20          A   As you look at this particular document, I

21     wasn't involved, I don't believe, in those focus groups,          f

22     so the summary  I'm going off the same summary that

23     you've got.                                                                                                     I

24          Q   If you go on to Bates number, the last numbers          |

25     are 1443 some ways inr and the top line is "Tar and                   jpgNbr=74
Page 74

1     Nicotine," and in parens, "Onsert."  Do you have that?

2          A   I see the page 1443, yes.

3          Q   The first bullet point states, quote, Tar and

4     nicotiner closed quote, ad that included information on

5     the onsert fell out of the mix.  Do you know what that

6     means?

7          A   I do not know what "fell out of the mix"

8     means.  It appears, if you look at the document before,

9     that there were two different tar and nicotine ads, at

10     least/ that were tested as part of this.

11          Q   In the context of your position and 

12     positions with Philip Morris USA and Altria over time,

13     are you familiar with the use of the phrase "fell out of

14     the mix"?

15          A   It's not a phrase that's very specific, so no,

16     ITm not exactly sure what that would mean.

17          Q    The second bullet point;  "The onsert does not

18     provide the proof point credibility expected."  Do you

19     know what is meant by that phrase, "does not provide the

20     proof point credibility expected"?

21          A   I don't know specifically what that phrase

22     means.  But if you compare it with the page before it, I

23     would guess that what we were doing would be testing two

24     different ads.  And the no-safe ads appears to be one

25     based on the comments that are on that page, and basedpgNbr=75
Page

1     on the summary that it's important information for

2     smokers to know, it appears that the reaction to that ad

3     in this focus group was different from the reaction to

4     the second execution which is described a little bit b           differently.

6          Q   The one on the page you're referring to with

7     1442, that's a tar and nicotine, no safe ad?

8          A    That's what the descriptor says, yes.

9          Q   And the next page, 1443, is a tar and nicotine

10     onsert ad, correct?

11          A   Yes.  They're described differently, which

12     would lead me to conclude they're different ads.

13          Q   They're two different ads, correct?

14          A   That would be my understanding.

15          Q   The document is dated, as you indicated, April

16     2 of 2003.  And in 2003, according to your affidavit,

17     the onsert distribution was in the fourth quarter --

18     strike that.

19              Starting again.  The document you're looking

20     at, Exhibit 9, is dated April 2, 2003.  In your

21     affidavit in referring to the first onsert campaign,

22     that was in November of 2002, fourth quarter of 2002.

23     Do you know if this summary of Exhibit 9, which is dated

24     April 2, 2C03, is referring to the low tar onsert

25     distribution in the fourth quarter of 2002?pgNbr=76
Page

1          A   What this document  based on my read of this

2     document, what this refers to is television advertising,

3     is my understanding.

4          Q   And what do you base that understanding on?

5          A   That it's labeled "Ad Test Results," that the

6     descriptions of the ads that are used are similar to the

7     descriptions that were used in other documents I've seen

8     describing the television advertising, particularly some

9     of the ones that were run, although not all of them, as

10     I know  appears to have multiple versions  so it

11     appears to be similar to  it's based on the

12     description of ad tests, based on the 2003 timing of the

13     document, and based on the descriptors that are used of

14     the advertising that was tested, that would lead me to

15     conclude that this is likely a document that was done

16     specifically related to television ad executions.

17          Q   Take a look at  near the end, Bates at the

18     end. is 1446, it's entitled, "No Safe (Radio)," isn't it?

19     So it would also encompass radio ads?

20          A   It could potentially encompass radio, which we

21     also would have been running, as I noted in my

22     affidavit, from 2003 to 2006, there was both television

23     and radio.  So, yes, I appreciate you pointing that out.

24          Q    So it wouldn't be limited to TV?

25          A   It appears not to have been.  And actually aspgNbr=77

1     there is no  I'm looking to see, having just got the              I

2     document, whether there's any specific reference to                    |

3     television.  Knowing that the types of ads that would               |

4     have been prepared around that time for television,                    j

5     radio, and print, some of these share the same                              I

6     descriptions of the television and radio spots.                            I

7          Q   And if you look at the document we were                        \

8     referring to a moment ago with the numbers 1443, that's            \

9     the one labeled "Tar and Nicotine (Onsert)," that would            f

10     have referred specifically to focus groups in addressing         f

11     onserts, right?                                                                                             I

12               MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.                                       I

13          A   Because it says  again, it says "'Tar and               I

14     Nicotine' ad" which would lead me to believe that we are         f

15     testing an advertising execution.                                                         I

16          Q   Through an onsert.  The second bullet point                |

17     says, "The onsert does not provide the proof point                      |

18     credibility expected," that doesn't refer to a                              f

19     television ad, does it?                                                                             j

20          A   It could,                                                                                          I

21          Q   An onsert would refer to a television ad?                    j

22          A   What you were referring to, which my guess is

23     that you're referring to here is two different                              f

24     executions of a tar and nicotine ad.  One of which you             |

25     are likely referring to as "no safe., " and I believe that          |pgNbr=78
Page 78 !

1     is a term that we've used in terms of the documents I've

2     seen, looking at the ads that we have placed related to           |

3     this issue, so that one I am much more comfortable on.              f

4              I don't know but would guess that what we were         f

5     testing here is an ad that potentially would have                        I

6     included that, but wouldn't know for sure without seeing         f

7     the documents that were tested at the time, or                              |

8     advertising executions.  It does refer to a tar and                   |

9     nicotine ad that included information on the onsert.  So         |

10     that's  I would base my description  based on the                f

11     description in the line above, I would guess that would           f

12     refer to an ad that included information on the onsert.            |

13          Q   You agree with me that the second bullet point          f

14     specifically says, "The onsert does not provide the                    [

i

15     proof point credibility expected."  It does say that,                1

19          A   I'm reviewing the document  I'm reviewing                I

20     this page of the document, and I think that that's  by         f

21     picking one line, you're not giving a complete                              |

23          Q   Well, the document is not limited to TV                       f

24     advertising because it takes into account radio and                    i

25     onserts also, doesn't it?                                                                           IpgNbr=79
Page 79

1          A   I don't believe that it takes into account

2     onserts.  And based on the information I'm seeing, I do

3     not share the same conclusion that you have as to what's

4     potentially being tested here.

5          Q    Is there any other manner in which the term

6     "onsert" is used in the manufacturing of cigarettes by

7     Philip Morris other than that small leaflet that is

8     inserted in the package that we refer to as an onsert,

9     is there any other way it's used?

10          A   We use "onsert" to describe a small leaflet

11     that attached to the cigarette pack.

12          Q   Is it used to describe anything else other

13     than that?

14          A        Not to my knowledge.

15          Q   Given the timing of this report, Exhibit 9, is

16     April 2,   2003, do you believe it has any relationship to

17     the first onsert campaign in the fourth quarter of 2002?

18          A   Relationship in what sense?

19          Q   Determining by way of focus groups the

20     efficacy of the onsert insertion campaign in the fourth

21     quarter of 2002?

22          A   My best guess on this document based on my

23     experience in dealing with focus groups and some of the

24     terms that are used in the document, and the timing of

25     this document, is this appears to be a document thatpgNbr=80

2              We use the term -- we do not use the term                   |

3     "advertising" to refer to onserts, we use that term                   f

4     distinctly.  So my best guess on this document based on           f

5     the terms I am familiar with of what you're looking at              j

6     here is a document that would have been done prior to                j

15              Do you believe that that also pertains to a TV         f

16     advertising campaign focus group process?                                         I

17          A   The page as contained in this entire document            f

18     that you've shared with me that's entitled "PMUSA Ad                 j

19     Test, Focus Group Results."                                                                     |

20          Q   It's a  I'm sorry, are you finished?                          I

21          A   Yes.                                                                                               j

22          Q   And it says on this particular page, "The

23     focus on the website is seen as advertising ..."  So                  f

24     it's possible that this is not just limited to focus                  I

25     group analysis of TV and radio ads, correct?                                  |pgNbr=81
Page

1          A   Our television and radio ads at the time

2     featured our web address as a place where people could

3     go for more information on these issues.

4          Q   On the document that is Bates stamped 1438 at

5     the end, top line is "'Parent Resource' &  Raising Kids

6     Who Don't Smoke," do you have that one?

7          A   It's 1438.  Yes, I do.

8          Q   There's reference there to "Brochure ads

9     credibility as a 'hands on tool.' Brochure ad has

10     stronger start with emphasis on statistical fact

11     indicating parent's role in YSP, more visual (images of

12     parents and children are positive)."

13              How does a focus group evaluation of a

14     brochure tie into a television ad campaign?

15          A   Again, I think you're potentially  what I

16     would describe is in a context of a television  this

17     is a document that evaluates television ad campaign,

18     that would be similar to how you would describe an

19     advertising execution that offers a brochure or that

20     includes a reference to a brochure in some way.

21          Q   Within the TV ad?

22          A   The use of the term "brochure ad" leads me to

23     believe that you are testing the ad in that instance

24     versus an individual brochure.

25          Q   Take a look at the page that's Bates stampedpgNbr=82

	Page 82 \

1
	1447, it's the third from the end.  There's a big black

2
	arrow pointing to the right to something that is labeled

3
	"ETS Parent Resource," and then in parens, "Brochure."

4
	Do you have an understanding of the context of that?

5
	A    I don't.

6
	Q   Do you have any understanding as to how that

7
	might relate to a TV ad focus group analysis?

8
	A   I don't find it to be particularly descriptive

9
	so I'm not sure what it's recommending or showing.

10
	MR. LANHAM:  You wanted a break for lunch?

11
	THE WITNESS:  If this is an appropriate time.

12
	MR. LANHAM:  Is that okay with you?

Page Exhibit No. 10.  I'd like you to take a look at that.

And you'll see that it's regarding a Marlboro Ultra

Lights onsert in-depth interviews project in November of

2 004.  It's authored by a Jan Angel, A-N-G-E-L.  Do you

know that name?

A   It is addressed to Jan Angel, sc she is the recipient rather than the author.

Q   You're right.

A   Jan currently works in the market information, market research area.

Q   Do you know her?

A   Would you give me a second to read this?

Q   Sure.  Do you know her?

A   I do know Jan, yes.

Q   Okay.  It purports to have as a research

objective,

Trade Secret Information Redacted

Trade Secret Information Redacted

A   It's not a term I use in my day-to-day work What it seems to indicate to me, though, is it's an onsert that is being tested before being finalized or

used.

1     interviews each scheduled for 15-20 minutes will be

2     conducted among adult male and female smokers 21+ who

3     consider Marlboro Kings Ultra Lights Kings or 100Ts to

4     be their main brand."

5                Is it typical with these kinds of interviews

6     to single out just a particular brand?

7                MS. MILBURW:  Objection, foundation.

8          A   I'm not sure what you're saying with "these

9     particular interviews."  I think the research -- it

10     would be typical for a research plan to be tailored to

11     the objectives that you were trying to achieve.

12           Q    Have you been involved in the formulation of

13     these kinds of research projects?

14          A   I've been involved in working with those in

15     our market information organization on developing

16     research  having them help me develop

17     research projects.

18           Q    With regard to onserts?

19           A   Not specifically with onserts, no.

20           Q   I'm not saying exclusively onserts, but have

21     onserts been included with work that you've done in that

22     regard?

23           A   No.  But I've worked with them generally on

24     other types of research projects where I've asked for

25     their services to help me -- where I've asked for thempgNbr=85
Page 85

1     to help me test a proposition.

2           Q   Do you have any way of knowing from looking at

3     this particular document what particular onsert was

4     used?  I ask that question because it refers to showing

5     them a concept onsert and asking them to comment on it.

6                My question is, do you know what the concept

7     onsert that was used here is?

8                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  This document is not

9      consecutively Bates numbered, these actually appear to

10     be two separate documents.  So itTs fine for him to

11     answer your question with respect to the first page, but

12     the second page is a separate document.

13                MR. LANHAM:  Thank you.  You have an eagle

14     eye.

15          A   Based on the information that's provided here,

16     I have no way of knowing what the onsert was  was

17     referring to in the content of that onsert.

18          Q   Do you know if  do you have any way of

19     knowing if it was a low tar onsert?

20          A   As I just said, I have no idea what the

21     content of that onsert was. 22

23                 (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 11 is

1           Q   Show you what has been marked as Exhibit 11.

2     This is entitled a "PMUSA No Safe, slash, Low Tar

3     Communication Vehicle Awareness Study," conducted by

4     MarketView Research, February of 2005.  Are you familiar

5     generally with the concept of a communication vehicle

6     awareness study? 1                      A   In a very general sense.  I was not involved

8     with the development of this document.

9           Q   In a general sense, how are you familiar with

10     it?

11          A   One of the ways in which I might do things 

12     again, I'm not sure if that's how this research was

13     conducted, it's not clear from the  that there's a

14     number of ways in which you can measure awareness of a

15      specific vehicle.

16           Q   And in this instance, second page, you'll see

17     that the background objective was "To measure general

18     awareness," as you've just said, "of PM USA's 'no

19     safe/low tar'"  and that's in quotes, no safe, slash,

20     low tar -- communication vehicles, open paren, onsert,

21     television, and radio, closed paren, among adult smokers

22     of PM USA, quote, low tar, closed quote, brands, as

23     measured by standard FTC testing methodology.

24                What does the term "no safe" refer to?

25          A    It appears to be an umbrella term for

3390538119

3990538119pgNbr=87
Page 8 7

1     communications that would describe specific executions

2     of the onsert television and radio.  So it appears to be

3     an umbrella term to describe subjects that address those

4     issues.

5          Q   The words "no safe," what do they refer to?

6                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

7           A   I'm not clear exactly what they refer to here.

8     I know that we have used  in our low tar

9     communications there is a specific phrase:  There's no

10      such thing as a safe cigarette, or something like that,

11     and that was included in some of the executions that

12     mentioned low tar in radio.  And I'd refer you back to

13     the affidavit for the specific language there.

14           Q   The methodology, at least as described here on

15     this particular study, is "Mall intercept interviews

16     conducted across 50 geographically disperse markets"

17     with 400 interviews.  Does that refer to shopping malls?

18           A   I don't know specifically.  That would

19     probably be one example, I don't know if it's exclusive.

20      I would read it the same way you would, but have never

21     delved in to figure out exactly what types of specific

22      stores or places it would be located in.

23           Q    It refers to 50 geographically disperse

24     markets, do you have any way of knowing if that's

25     intended to comport with 50 states within the United

3890538120

3990538120pgNbr=88
Page 8:

1     States?

2           A   It's not clear from there, but it's  they're

3     geographically dispersed.  I don't know necessarily what

4     those markets were based on this one line.

5           Q   Look at the next page, the last numbers of

6     Bates stamp are 7415.  It has for vehicle awareness, it

7     has "Onsert, 39," and then you'll see over here the

8     number "100," the bar is 0 to 100.  Do you interpret

9     that to mean that 39 percent of those who were

10      interviewed were aware of the onserts?

11           A   I would interpret that as being a percent.  I

12     don't know the specific question that was asked, but

13     based on the label, "Vehicle Awareness," that's probably

14     pretty close.  But I don't know exactly what it's

15     capturing there.

16           Q   I fully accept and understand that you don't

17     know the particulars.  But based on the objective and

18     the methodology in this bar graph, it appears that of

19      these folks interviewed, 39 percent were aware of the

20     onserts?

21                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.

22           A    I answered that question.  I agree.

23           Q   You agree?

24          A   No, I answered the question.  I agree with my

25     attorney that I answered the cuestion.

3390538121

3990538121pgNbr=89
Page 89

1          Q   Okay.

2          A   And I would direct you back to my exact prior

3     answer as how I would answer it if it were asked again.

4          Q   Which is to suggest another question, that 61

5     percent of those were not aware of the low tar, no safe

6     cigarette onsert; that's the converse of that, isn't it?

7          A   That would be the converse of it, yes.

8          Q   Do you know if there is a breakout between a

9     low tar onsert and a no safe onsert, or is this

10     referring to a single onsert that is referred to in the

11     documentation as no safe, slash, low tar?

12              And I'm going beyond this document,

13     Mr. McCormick.  I'm asking for you to respond to that

14     question based upon your use of the term, awareness of

15     the term and so forth.

16              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

17          A   What I would  again, not having written this

18     document, I'll have to make a guess what these terms are

19     referring to.  What this appears to be is a study that

20     measures general awareness of these types of

21     communications, vehicles, onsert television and radio

22     among adult smokers.

23          Q   My next question is beyond this document.

24     When one sees reference to in any literature of Philip

25     Morris the phrase "no safe, slash, low tar," in the

Page 9 0 context of onserts, is that referring to a single onsert identified as suchr or are there separate onserts, those that address no safe and those that address low tar?

A   I would not  the first part of your question I have an issue with, but I would not make any broad generalizations about every time you see a phrase  I'm not comfortable making any broad generalizations like that.

My understanding of our onsert executions is that we had a low tar onsert that included language that said there's no safe cigarette.  And that language is included in  the complete language of that onsert is included in the affidavit.  And it leads with:  There's no such thing as a safe cigarette, in this example, including this one.  I am not aware of a separate and distinct onsert that had a different message.  This appears to be measuring awareness of that onsert, along with related television and radio with similar types of communications.

(McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 12 is marked.)

Q   Show you Exhibit No. 12.  And you will see

3890538123

3990538123pgNbr=91
Page 91

1     once you review it, Mr. McCormick, that this is a

2     similar awareness study conducted by the same firm,

3     MarketView Research, but now this is January of 2006,

4     and the one we just looked at in Exhibit 11 is February

5     of 2005.  Are you finished reviewing it?

6          A    I am.

7          Q   Again, the background objectives are similar

8     to the other one, To measure general awareness of PM

9     USA's no safe, slash, low tar communication vehicles,

10     open paren, onsert and television, closed paren, among

11     adult smokers of PM USA low tar brands as measured by

12     standard FTC testing methodology.  Do you see that?

13          A   I see that on the document, yes.

14          Q   The difference compared to the other one that

15     we just looked at, that one was onsert television and

16     radio, this one is onsert and television, correct?

17          A   Yes, that's the difference in that section

18     called "Background/Objectives."

19          Q   Under the section "Stimuli," there are two

20
	explanations for  there's one for onsert, one for
	
21
	television.  Onsert says, PM USA's, quote, information
	
22
	for smo
	kers, closed quote, low tar onsert.  Do you see

23
	that?
	

24
	A
	I do.

25
	Q
	You had some exhibits in your affidavit that

3990538124

3990538124pgNbr=92
Page 92

1     included those onserts that are labeled as information

2     for smokers, correct?

3          A   Yes.  That was Exhibit B in my affidavit.

4          Q   Yeah.  Back to Exhibit 12, same page where it

5     says "Television" under "Stimuli," it says:  CR

6     advertising, quote, what tobacco issues, colon, health

7     effects, closed quote, ad.  Do you know what that is

8     referring to?

9          A   I don't remember specifically the content of

10     that ad.

11          Q   What do the initials CR stand for in front of

12     advertising?

13          A   Probably corporate responsibility advertising.

14          Q   And you see under "Methodology" where again

15     this was "Mall intercept interviews conducted across 50

16     geographically disperse markets" with 407 interviews.

17     Do you see that?

18          A   I see that.

19          Q    If you turn to the next page, similar to the

20     other exhibit that we looked at on the 0 to 100 scale,

21     it appears that with regard to the onsert prong of this,

22     44 percent of those interviewed had awareness, and on

23     the television, 24 percent had awareness, correct?

24          A   That's what that document seems to state.

25     Again, I'm not sure exactly how that research was

1     conducted.

2           Q   Then if you look at the page Bates stamped

3     6585, there's a  read for "Aware One Vehicle Only,"

4     for example, "Onsert Only" or "Television Only," then it

5     gives the figures there.  So for those who were aware of

6     only one of them on the onserts, 27 percent were aware,

7     and television, 7 percent were aware.  Is that a fair

8     interpretation of that on its face?

9                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

10          A   If you look at this single page, it's labeled

11      "Aware One Vehicle Only, 34" percent, "Onsert Only, 27;

12     Television Only, 7."  There's also a page that you

13      skipped over which indicates awareness of at least one

14     vehicle, that in this document has that 51 percent were

15     aware of at least one vehicle.  And then the other

16     document, you skipped that page as well, that indicates

17     that 63 percent were aware of at least one vehicle.

18           Q   The page with the Bates stamp 6584?

19           A   Yes.

20           Q   That indicates that 51 percent were aware of

21     at least one vehicle?

22          A   Correct, in Document 12.  And the second place

23      I was referring you back to the document we just looked

24     at, since we're looking at the two side by side, in

25     Document 11, for a similar page in that one, 63 percent

1            are aware of at least one vehicle.

3                 (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 13 is

4                marked.) 5

6           Q    I've handed you Exhibit 13, entitled:  PM USA

7     HE, slash, LT Communications Vehicle Awareness Research,

8     January 2006, Draft Report, January 2006.  Have you

9     finished reviewing it?

10          A   I have.

11           Q    You'll see at the top of the first page,

12     there's a logo "MV," MarketView Research, and of course

13     Exhibits 11 and 12 indicate they were conducted by

14     MarketView Research.  And then on Page 2 of Exhibit 13,

15     states, "In February 2005, a study was conducted to

16     measure overall awareness of PM USA's 'No Safe/Low Tar'

17     communications among adult smokers of PM USA Low Tar

18     brands."  That appears to refer to what is Exhibit 11,

19     correct?

20          A   It appears to refer to that, yes.

21           Q   Then continuing on, "A similar study was

22     conducted in January of 2006 to gauge awareness of PM

23     USA's 'Health Effects/Low Tar* communications."  That

24     appears to refer to Exhibit 12; do you agree?

25          A   I'm not sure if it refers to Exhibit 12, but I

3390538127

3990538127pgNbr=95
Page

1     haven't done a complete comparison of the documents.

2     But it seems like a study described in this document is

3     similar to the study described in there in terms of the

4     number of people that were reached, as well as the dates

5     for the study in Exhibit 12.

6           Q   And in Exhibit 13, it makes reference on Page

7     2 to the:  PM USA Low Tar (LT) onsert, then in parens,

8     found on PM USA non-full-flavor cigarette packs only,

9     correct?

10           A    I'm sorry?

11           Q    Page 2, sir.

12           A   Is it the one labeled Page 1?

13           Q   Yes, you're right.  It's page two of the

14     exhibit, it's Page 1 here.

15           A   That's why I lost you.  Could you read it

16     again?

17           Q    I'm just asking you to confirm it's referring

18     to  as to the onsert, it's referring to the PM USA Low

19     Tar LT onsert found on PM USA non-full-flavor cigarette

20     packs only?

21           A   Yes, that's what it says under

22      "Background/Objectives" on this page.

23           Q   And again, on page three of the exhibit, Page

24     2 in the lower right-hand corner, again, it describes

25     the one-on-one interviews in 50 geographically dispensed

	markets among adult smokers of low tar PM brands from

2
	January 13 to January 22, 2006, correct?

3
	A   That's what that says, yes.

4
	Q    If you just simply go to the next page, it

5
	lays the numbers out in a different format than the

5
	other exhibit.  And here those indicating that they had

7
	seen the no safe, low tar leaflet were 44 percent of the

8
	total.  Do you see that?

9
	A    T do.

10
	Q   And 53 percent had not seen the no safe, low

11
	tar leaflet before, and 3 didn't know, right?

12
	A   That's what that says.

13
	MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

14
	Q   So on the face of this awareness study, more

15
	people than not  strike that.

16
	On the face of this study, more people had not

17
	seen the leaflet than had seen it; true?

18
	A    In the context of just this specific page,

19
	yes.  But I'll note that some of these studies also look

20
	at. the other types of communications that we have done.

21
	This specific page is specifically 

22
	Q   And I'm moving to the next page 

23
	MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  Let him finish his

24
	answer, please.

25
	A   This specific page, as I noted, is only

3990538129

3990538129pgNbr=97
Page

1     referring to the low tar onsert.  This study is also

2     looking at at least one other means of communications

3     when it refers to the 2006 piece.

4           Q   Right.  And I did not mean to cut you off, I

5     had my head down.  I don't believe in doing that.  Okay.

6                Let's see, the next page.  This has to do with

7     the health effects TV commercial, appears that of the

8     total, 24 percent had seen the commercial and 70 percent

9     had not, and 6 percent didn't know or had no answer,

10     correct?

11           A         That's what the study says in terms of 24

12     percent saying that they saw that specific commercial

13     before, 7 0 percent saying they have not seen it before,

14     and 6 percent don't know or no answer.

15          Q   With regard to that TV commercial that's

16     referred to in here as health effects in quotes, do you

17     know if that commercial made any reference to anything

18     about low tar cigarettes?

19           A    It's tough to tell specifically from here what

20      commercial that is  that is referring to.

21           Q   Do you have any way independent of looking at

22     this of knowing?

23           A   The way you would look at that would be to,

24     you know, figure out exactly what the ad is labeled in

25     the context of the story board or something along those

97

3390538130

3990538130pgNbr=98
Page 98

1      lines.

2           Q   So just having it referred to as "health

3     effects" is not enough, is it?

4          A   It's not enough for me to know specifically

5     what ad you're talking about right now.

6           Q   They refer in this document to a leaflet,

7     that's the same thing as the onsert, isn't it?

8                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  This document 

9     you're on 13 now?

10                MR. LANHAM:  I am.

11           A   Which page are you lcoking at?

12           Q   Where they have  well, it's Page 3, lower

13     right-hand corner, but page four of the exhibit.

14           A   Yes, the term "leaflet" is used there.

15           Q   That's synonymously used with or

16     interchangeably used with onsert?

17                MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

18           A    It's tough for me to tell whether it's

19      interchangeably used, but that's how I would read those

20     results.  If you're trying to give a consumer who is not

21      familiar with a term that we use from a manufacturing

22      standpoint of an onsert to help -- it seems similar to

23     how you would describe that in that context. 24

4          Q   Hand you exhibit  just a minute.  Again,

5     Exhibit No. 14 with all the pages, and a copy for

6     counsel.  This is from the firm Marketing Perceptions,

7     Strategic Planning Research to, again, Jan Angel, who

8     you mentioned earlier.  A memo dated March 15, 2006.

9     The reference line is "Marlboro Ultra Lights Qualitative

10     Research-Arizona."

11              Research objectives are indicated as

12     "Qualitative research was conducted among adult smokers

13     to explore their perceptions of Marlboro Ultra Lights,

14     including thoughts as to any differences noticed when

15     smoking the brand over the past few months."  Are you

16     familiar with this project?

17          A   I'm not familiar with the specific research

18     project.  This is the first time I've seen this

19     document.

20          Q   You're familiar with projects like it, though?

21          A   I am, again, generally familiar.  I worked

22     with our research group on a range of projects over the

23     years.

24          Q    The research design for this particular one

25     was indicated as, quote, Individual in-depth interviews

390538132

3990538132pgNbr=100
Page 100

1     were conducted among 41 adult male and female smokers

2     ages 21 to 64 who have smoked Marlboro Ultra Lights

3     non-menthol box in the past three months.  Nearly all

4     the respondents consider Marlboro Ultra Lights to be

5     their main brand.  Do you know  closed quote.

6                Do you know if when these kinds of studies are

7     done if an effort is made to identify interviewees who

8     consider the cigarette at issue to be their main brand?

9                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, form and foundation.

10           A   What this says is "Nearly all of the

11     respondents consider Marlboro Ultra Lights to be their

12     main brand."

13           Q   My question is, the product, Marlboro Ultra

14     Lights, non-menthol box is what is the focus of the

15      study.  And when the company decides to have a study

16     that is going to be devoted to a particular brand,

17     whatever it is, is there an effort made to make sure

18     that the interviewees see that brand as their main brand

19     that they smoke?

20           A   That would depend on the type of research that

21     you were conducting, as well as the ability to find the

22     audience you're looking for to test that.  The way we

23     would do that is if you were doing that type of study,

24     you would work closely with those research partners and

25     the market information group and some of their vendors,

3390538133

3990538133pgNbr=101
Page 101

1     and they would help you tailor the study based on what

2      could be accomplished and based on what would help you

3      learn the information you were looking to learn through

4     that research.

5           Q   The memo purports to address several subject

6     areas.  First is product quality, the second

7     availability experiences, and the third onsert

8     awareness.  I'm only going to ask. you a few questions

9     with regard to the last category entitled, "Onsert

10     Awareness," sub category C.

11                The memo reads that in the first paragraph,

12      (as read):  Quote, Asked if they had noticed any type of

13     onsert or small pamphlet on the cigarette packs, almost

14     all the adult smokers participating in this research

15     recalled that they had seen some type of material under

16     the cellophane on their packs.  Some thought they had

17      seen this fairly recently, while most felt that 

18      strike that  while most felt they had not noticed this

19     or. their packs for, quote, maybe it's been a month or so

20      since they had that on there, closed quote.

21                Do you think that that kind of representation

22      is suggestive that the use of onserts is a good means of

23     communication during the time frame that this was

24     conducted?

2     you're asking about this specific study, is that your                 f

3     question?                                                                                                                   j

9          A    I believe that onserts is, you know, one of                 I

10     the most effective ways we have to directly communicate             I

11     with the smoker of any specific pack.  I would also add            |

12     tear tape to kind of that direct-to-consumer                                     |

13     communications, as well as some of other things that we             I

14     do because it gives you the ability to take that message          |

15     and put it directly in the hands of your intended                          f

16     audience.                                                                                                                   |

17                So I think what this indicates is that our                   |

18     approach of  with onserts of putting it in is                              |

19     indicating that people are recalling that, they're                        |

20     recalling that it's incidental in nature throughout the             f

21     course of the year.  Almost all of them are realizing                 |

22     that it's there.  And what this is indicating is that                 |

23     they're recognizing that the information is provided,                  f

24     not 100 percent of the time, but from time to time.

25          Q   Onserts vary in message that they convey,                      1pgNbr=103
Page 103 |

1     don't they?

2          A    We have used onserts to communicate a range of

3     different messages, yes.

4          Q    Within the corporate responsibility program,

5     there are different messages, only one of which is no 5            safe, low tar, correct?

7          A   That is correct.

8           Q   And outside of the corporate responsibility

9     program, onserts are used for branding messages and

10     marketing purposes, aren't they?

11          A   Or to communicate product information, and

12     that appears to be what this document is referring to.

13           Q   And so the onserts, whether it's within the

14     context of the corporate responsibility program or it's

15     outside the corporate responsibility program, there are

16     any number of different messages communicated through

17     onserts; true?

18           A   We use onserts to communicate a range of

19     different messages.

20           Q   And no message is effectively communicated

21     unless somebody opens the onsert and reads it; would you

22     agree with that?

23          A   We communicate a message generally,

24     particularly our message on low tar cigarettes, in a

25     broad range of different ways; onserts is one of the

390538136

3990538136pgNbr=104
Page 104 f

1     ways in which we communicate that.  It wouldn't be the               1

2     only waY that people are exposed to that.  But the goal             1

3      is that they have that information in there.  And the                 I

4     reason we provide it is we do want them to read that                   |

5      information, but we also provide it in a range of other             I

6     ways.                                                                                                                            I

i

7           Q   And it's not communicated ultimately unless

8      somebody opens it and reads it; do you agree with that?             |

9                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.               |

10                MR. LANHAM:  I don't believe he answered it.               1

11           A   The goal is  which we're talking                                     f

12      specifically about an onsert, I think the message can be          1

13      communicated and is communicated in a range of different          I

14     ways.  With respect to an onsert, your goal is to have

15     them read the information inside that onsert.                                   |

16           Q    Otherwise it's not effective, is it?                                 I

17                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.                I

18           A   Otherwise they're not reading that information          f

19     that's in there, but it is communicated in a range of                 |

20     different ways.                                                                                                      |

21           Q   Next paragraph here says, "Most respondents                 I

22     commented that they had 'probably read one of these at

23      some point some time ago.' Few felt compelled to                            I

24     continue to look at this material, since, as was often               |

25     said during these interviews, 'I just assume they're all          IpgNbr=105
Page 105 |

1     pretty much going to say the same thing.'"

2                Based upon that comment that is purportedly

3     attributable to one of the persons interviewed, do you

4     think that onserts that convey different messages at

5     different times are an effective form of communication

6     in the context of a no safe, low tar onsert message?

7                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

8          A   I believe that onserts are an effective way of

9     communicating, and certainly  even though this is a

10     very small research group with 41 smokers, it's

11     nonscientific as the research limitations notes.  It's

12     not projectionable, not necessarily representative of

13     the broader market of smokers, so this document puts

14     those qualifiers on anything that you gather from this

15     research approach.

16                I think the fact that most respondents are

17     commenting that they have probably read one of these at

18     some point is a very good sign, and I think it's the

19     right thing to do for us to continue to put that type of

20     message out there in a range of different ways,

21     including on onserts.

22           Q   How do you address the potential problem that

23     people say, oh, there's another onsert, I've read that

24     before, I'm go not going to bother to read it again; and

25     in fact, it's a different variation or it's a different

3390538138

3990538138pgNbr=106
Page 106

1     message in the onsert that they're choosing not to read?

2                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form and

3      foundation.

4           A         The onserts that we have used to communicate

5     on issues look different.  So the onsert communication

6     on low tar is different from our communication on the

7     website, is different from our communication on quitting

8      smoking, so those would appear different when placed in

9     the cigarette pack.

10           Q   How do you address the issue of smokers not

11     appreciating the distinction that you just made, and

12      instead they interpret what they see as just one more of

13     the same thing yet again?

14           A   I wouldn't disagree with your characterization

15     of the research and what smokers are  the group of

16      smokers are saying in this research.

17           Q   How do you get around that in terms of wanting

18     to have more effective communication?

19           A   Again, I wouldn't agree with the first part so

20      I'm not quite sure what you're asking me to get around.

21      So I would answer the second part of the question and

22      indicate what we do to communicate as effectively as we

23      can in as broad a way as possible.  I think that's laid

24     out in my affidavit, where the sum of our communications

25     on this issue starts with making information available

3390538139

3990538139pgNbr=107
Page 107

1     on our website, continues with a range of communications

2     that are on-pack, including onserts, communications in

3     our advertising, tear tape, the broad range of

4     television advertising.  So what we've done over the

5     years has been to communicate in multiple forms, in

6     multiple ways.

7                On this issue we're communicating essentially

8     the same message, and we're communicating it in kind of

9     a sustained way over time by making that information

10     available to consumers in a range of different ways.

11     And we continue to put the web address out there in a

12     range of different ways to encourage those who are

13      interested in more information on that and other issues,

14     to tell them where they can find that, which is on the

15     company website.

16           Q   You do that, as you've just described it, at

17     least in part because you know that there is a

18     possibility that smokers don't appreciate that there are

19     different messages in different onserts.  And there is

20     the risk that they will see those onserts as being the

21      same thing yet again, and therefore, not read them, so

22     you do these other things to respond to that; is that

23     true?

1
	A   I don't agree with the first part of your         |

2
	question.  Again, the reason we do that is we have a        |

3
	range of communications vehicles at our disposal.  I do     \

6
	conclusions are for smokers in general.  I don't agree      [

7
	with the way you characterized why we communicate.  What

8
	we have tried to do is to communicate in a range of

9

4                Do you agree with me that the email string                   |

5     relates to the document that we just were looking at                   |

6     that is marked as Exhibit 14?

7          A    I haven't done a full comparison, but I would             f

8     note that the Phoenix location, the Marlboro Ultra                        

9     Lights focus, the dates of the survey and the number of             |

10      smokers are identical.                                                                                      j

11           Q   So at least on its face, it looks to be the                 j

12     s ame?                                                                                                                            |

13          A   Based on those factors, it's appears to be

14     based on the same research project.                                                         I

15           Q    And she says in her email that this was                          | 15            research conducted in Phoenix March 6 and 7, 2006, who               |

19     three months.  That's the same one identified in the                   j

20     other, isn't it?                                                                                                   f

21          A   Yes.                                                                                                        1

22           Q   Then she lists a number of key findings.  If               |

23     you'll take a look at Page 2 of the email, she writes:               f

24      "When asked if they had noticed any type of onsert or                 j

Page 110 |

1     bullet point, "Almost all of the adult smokers                                |

2      interviewed recalled seeing some type of pamphlet on                   |

3     their packs."  Second bullet point, "Most commented they          j

4     had 'probably read one of these at some point,' and most          |

5     recalled topics related to the Corporate insert."  Then

6      she --                                                                                                                         |

7                MS. MILBURN:  Onsert.                                                                  I

8                MR. LANHAM:  I'm sorry, what did I say?                          j

9                MS. MILBURN:  Insert.                                                                  I

10                MR. LANHAM:  Thank you.  I meant onsert.

11           Q   Then she adds another item, "None among these             |

12      adult respondents recall noticing a flavor message."                   1

13      That's consistent with the report that we just looked                 f

14     at, isn't it?                                                                                                          |

15          A   In the sense that most of those  she appears          |

16      to be testing for recall on a specific flavor execution             f

17     in this particular market on this particular product.                  f

18     And in the context, what people are remembering is that             |

19     they have seen  probably read one of these at some                   1

20     point, and that most are recalling topics, not                                 I

21      specifically on a flavor communication that she appears             I

22     to be testing, but on the topics that are related to the          |

23      corporate onsert, which would include the low tar                            | 2 4             message.                                                                                                                                 | 25          Q    In fact, she's saying that none among the                        |pgNbr=111
Page 111

1     respondents recall noticing a flavor message, right?

2           A    That's what it says regarding that specific

3     execution that she appears to be trying to test.

4          Q    If you come up the email string, the next

5     email message right up from that first one is from her

6     to a James  a Doug James on May 2, five or six weeks

7     later.  And she says to him:  "This was the study that

8     mgmt. attended in Phoenix."

9                And if you keep going up, Mr. James responds

10     to her that same day:  "Thanks for all this Jan.  They

11     all look pretty consistent in both markets."  Then he

12     has four bullet items, and the fourth one is:

13      "Generally not much attention is paid to the onserts."

14     Do you see that?

15                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

16           A    I see the line in that email that says

17      "Generally not much attention is paid to the onserts,"

18     yes.

19           Q   Who is Doug James?

20           A   I don't know.

21           Q   You've never heard of him?

22           A   No.

23           Q   Okay.  Do you have any reason to know whether

24     he works with Jan Angel?

25                MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.pgNbr=112
Page 112

1           A   I don't know who he is.

2           Q   What is Jan AngelTs present position, if you

3     know?

4           A   I don't know specifically, but I know what

5     department she works in, which is a group that's

6     generally described as the market information group.  It

7     may have a slightly different title, but she works in 3            the market information group.

9                       Q    Is that within your chain of command of

10     responsibility?

11          A    It's not.

12           Q   It is not?

13          A   Before we move off that, I think you're also

14     missing Jan's response to his email where she disagrees

15     with his assumption that generally not much attention is

16     paid to the onserts.  She says she's rephrasing that to

17     say most Marlboro Ultra Light adult nonsmokers

18     associated onserts with the corporate onsert, which they

19     already know the messaging.  So that would be referring

20     tc the low tar piece, and I think that's an important

21     piece to understand this document in context.

22           Q   Brand loyalty is a concept that is valued at

23     Philip Morris, isn't it?

24           A   Yes.  I think any consumer products company

25     would prefer to have consumers who are loyal to their

1     brand rather than those who are not.                                                       I

2           Q   And one of Philip Morris's goals is to foster             j

3     brand loyalty among Philip Morris brand smokers; do you            |

16           Q   What do you understand the phrase "brand                       |

19     understanding of it is, it's the value  you know,                      I

20     equity is used in other contexts in values, so I think               |

21     it's used as kind of a broader term that encompass many            |

22     elements that give value to a brand.                                                       |

15     there's no  it's inaccurate with regard to my                              I

17     of how we've used pack onserts for marketing purposes.               I

18           Q    You do know that starting in 2004 the use of               

19     onserts was expanded beyond just low tar and nicotine                 1

1           Q   Let me ask it even more basically:  Are you

2     even aware at all that its use was expanded beyond just

3     low tar messages?

4          A   I am aware generally that from time to time

5     that we have used onserts for marketing communications,

6     that's probably the extent of my knowledge.  It is not

7     nearly as deep as it is on some of these other issues;

8     it's not an issue that I was directly involved in.

9           Q   Okay.  Take a look at this exhibit, please.

10          A   Okay.

11           Q   The last time the onserts were used, I believe

12     you said earlier, was the second quarter of 2008; is

13     that correct?

14          A   2008 was the last time we used  we had a low

15     tar message on our onserts.

16           Q   And up until that time, were you involved in

17     the operation of the use of onserts?  I mean, did you

18      continue  I'm not asking it well.  Did you continue to

19     be involved with that aspect of the company's business

20     up until the time you stopped using them, you

21     personally?

23          A    I think the first  you seem to have multiple

24     questions in there.

25                         Q         I'll  ask  it  again.     When  did your  involvement

	Q    Yeah.                                              [

7
	A   I've never been directly involved in any

8
	aspect of the onsert program.  I'm aware of what we've      j

9
	been doing, so I would put my involvement more in the

10
	aspect of awareness and having an understanding of the

11
	scope of the company's efforts and the messages that

12
	were being communicated.

13
	Q   And it's in that context that you provided

14
	your affidavit, that is your awareness of what was being    ;

15
	communicated, and how and when?                             <

21
	Q   This exhibit that I've handed you, on the very

	understanding of what that means?

3390538149

3990538149pgNbr=117
Page 117 I

1     would view the words both "preliminary" for discussion               |

2     purposes only, and "cross-functional consideration" to

3     mean this was a document that was designed to be shared            I

4     with others for input.  But my sense is it's very early             1

5      in the process.  And it's also labeled "Draft."                               I

6           Q   What does cross-functional consideration mean?           |

7          A   When I would use the term "cross-functional,"             |

8     it would mean I would involve that with other functions             |

9     or departments outside of my own.                                                              j

10           Q   And your department in 2003 and four was what;

11     where were you working?                                                                                    |

12           A   I was working within the communications                          |

13     department through probably September 2 004, I believe.                i

14     So in 2003, probably through the tail end, probably                     |

15     through the first three quarters, I was in that media                 |

1                MR. LANHAM:  Let me finish my question,

2     please.

3           Q   Are you familiar with the concept of enhancing

4     brand equity?

5          A   We had talked about that earlier.  In the

6     context in which I described it earlier is my

7     familiarity with it.

8           Q   And are you familiar with it in the context of

9     developing onserts in order to enhance brand equity?

10           A   I am familiar generally with the concept of

11     brand equity.  As I mentioned earlier, I was not

12     involved in specific efforts, and I'm not aware of the

13      specific nature of our efforts to use onserts as a

14     vehicle to do that other than I believe we've done it

15     from time to time.

16           Q    Okay.  And I'm not asking you about your

17     awareness of specific efforts, I'm asking you if you are

18     aware generally of the use of onserts for the purpose of

19     enhancing brand equity?  I think that can be answered

20     yes or no.

21           A   And I said what I am familiar with is that we

22     have used onserts to communicate marketing messages in a

23     very general sense, and that's probably the extent of my

24     knowledge in that area.

25           Q    If you'd look at the next page, please, on

2     of these five brand onsert communication examples of                   |

5          A    In the context of this document, what this                   | 5            appears to be is a suggestion for ways  for things                   f

7     they could possibly do.                                                                                    |

8           Q   With onserts?                                                                                    j

10           A   That's the context in which the overall                    |

11     this is a 2 004 onsert proposal.  And the document says

12      "Brand Onsert Communication Examples," so it appears to             |

13     be samples of things that this individual is                                     |

14     recommending and plans to share with others for                              j

15     consideration.                                                                                                        f

16           Q    On the next page, Page 5, as part of what is               |

17     being considered in the context of what is called                          j

18      "Planning Information," is "Onsert Name, Communication               j

19     Type, Launch Geography, Duration of Volume at Retail,                  j

20      Indication of Promotion Assembly, Brand Packings."

21                My question is, do you understand what the                   j

22     phrase "Duration of Volume at Retail" refers to?                            |

23           A    When it ccmes to planning information in the

24      context of this document, I'm not sure in its entirety               I

25     that I can describe what any of those individual terms               {pgNbr=120

2           Q   We were talking earlier in your deposition

3     about the one-week, two-week average sales distinction

4     in the context of Class A and B cigarettes, and Class C

5     and D cigarettes.  In that context, do you know if the

6     phrase "Duration of Volume at Retail" has any

7     relationship?

8                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

9          A   Again, because I'm not specific with the 

10      I'm not comfortable describing the relationship between

11     this document and the statements I made earlier, I am

12      comfortable letting you know how we -- and have

13     described how we looked at those terms, how we described

14     the scope of our efforts when it came to onsert

15     production in areas that include the low tar message.  I

16     was not involved in any of this, so I don't know for

17      sure whether they were looking at it the same way or

18     not.

19           Q   If you'd look at Page 7, do you recognize that

20     as being the form of an onsert?

21           A   Perhaps.  I don't know for sure.

22           Q    Could you explain to me, please, why you don't

23     know for sure?  What is it about what you see on that

24     Page 7 that leads you to say that you don't know for

	A   It's the entire document, which is because

2
	this is a document that I am unfamiliar with, I'm

3
	uncomfortable telling you exactly what the author of

4
	this document included and what they were trying to

5
	communicate, so I would just be guessing.

5
	Q   Does what is shown on Page 8 appear to be an

8
	MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  I think it's been

9
	asked and answered.

10
	MR. LANHAM:  It's a different page.

	MS. MILBURN:  It's a different page, but it's

12

14
	just object, please, form or foundation.  Let him

15
	answer.

16
	MS. MILBURN:  I believe I can state my

17
	reasons.

18
	A   Can you repeat the question?

19
	Q   Yeah.  Is what is depicted on Page 8 an

20
	example of an onsert?

21
	A    I can't tell what's depicted on Page 8.

22
	Q    Next page, please.  Left-hand column under

23
	"Brand," it says "Marlboro (Main Line)."  What is main

24

	Q
	Do you know what percentage of Marlboros sold

4
	in the United States are low tar?
	
5
	A
	Not off the top of my head 1 don't.

6
	Q
	Do you have a reasonable estimate?

7
	A
	I don't.

8
	Q
	There's no number on it, but the bottom of the

9
	page  the Bates number, the last four is 7285, if you
	
10
	would turn to that one.  The very top it says, "Proposed
	
11
	2004 Onsert Launch Overview."  Do you have that?
	
12
	A
	I see the page that  you're on 7285?

13
	Q
	Yes, I am.

14
	A
	I 'm on that page.

15
	Q
	It lists a cigarette called Basic.  Is the

15
	brand Basic a low tar product?
	
17
	A
	Basic, I believe, has a range of different

18
	offerings
	-

19
	Q
	Including low tar?

20
	A
	I believe it includes low tar.  I believe it

21
	includes
	full flavor.

22
	Q
	In looking at that page that is entitled

23
	"Proposed
	2 004 Onsert Launch Overview," I don't see any

24
	reference
	to low tar or the NS, no safe, slash, LT, low

25
	tar, onsert; do you have an explanation for that?

2          A   Again, this is not a document I'm familiar

3     with.  What I've told you, though, is when we've

4     conducted our low tar onsert communications in 2004, and

5     that information is in my affidavit.  So that's a

6     reflection of what we did 

7                MS. MILBURN:  Let him finish his answer.

8          A    that's a reflection of what we did.

9           Q    In that regard, do you have -- have you had

10     any involvement in any discussion as to where the use of

11     the no safe, low tar onserts would fit into the broader

12     onsert program that includes the use of onserts for

13     other messaging purposes?

14                MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form.

15          A   As I noted earlier, the area that I'm most

16     familiar with is how it's been used in some of those

17     other communications, specifically with low tar as the

18     area that I've delved deepest in in preparation for

19     this.  So I have not had, as I noted earlier, detailed

20      communications or awareness about the marketing

21      component of how they used onserts.

22           Q   Let me try to ask it a different way.  I

23     respectfully suggest that that's not the question I

24     asked.  You have particular expertise with regard to

25     onserts; agree?

15      I'm just trying to get a sense from you as to whether           j

16     given that understanding, have you had occasion at any               I

17     time to be involved in where that use of onserts, i.e.,             !

18     low tar messaging, fits into the bigger picture, if you            I

19     will, of using onserts for other purposes?                                         |

3     those quarters mentioned in your affidavit, an onsert                I

4     that was used for one week in terms of the average sales          |

5     volume that we talked about earlier was not used for two         I

6     weeks or three weeks or four weeks?                                                    j

7          A   Can you repeat the question?                                              |

9          Q   Yes.  You've answered questions earlier with             

10     regard to onserts, the low tar onserts being used in                  j

11     packaging based upon the one-week and two-week average              I

14              And my question is, if there was a decision               1

15     made to use one-week average sales for A and B Brands,              I

16     why not use -- do the same for two weeks, or even three           |

17     or four; why one week?

18              MS. MILBURN:  Objection to form, compound.                  j

19          A   The reason we used  it came up with an                      f

20     average weekly sales volume for the onsert                                      |

24     that were listed on the documents that we went through             \

25     earlier was because that enabled us to reach by our                    lpgNbr=126

1     first  for estimates related to that first

2     distribution in 2002, we estimated that we would be able         1

3     to reach 86 percent of the smokers of those brands by               |

4     making it available for that period of time.                                  |

5          Q   By making it available for one week based upon         I

6     average sales for that brand?                                                                f

9     made that would include the onsert.                                                     I

10          Q   If one-week average sales would provide that              >

11     kind of reach, would not two-week's average sales                        j

12     potentially result in even a greater reach?                                    j;

13              MS. MILBURN:  Objection.                                                       j

14          A   What I don't know is whether it would be                 j

15     this was  reminder that this was one of the                                |

16     communications vehicles in which we were using, it was              I

17     not the only one.  What the 86 percent, measures is for

18     that specific execution.  I don't know how much higher             f

19     adding another week's worth of volume would have gotten            f

20     you in terms of the percentage of specific smokers.                    |

21          Q        Were you personally involved in the analysis

22     to make the determination that the one-week average that    |

23     you've just described would reach 86 percent of the

24     smokers?                                                                                                           I

25          A   I was not involved in conducting that                            \pgNbr=127
Page 12 7

1     analysis.  I was involved in drafting a communication

2     that included that number, a press release that was

3     developed at the time, so would have verified that

4     number to make sure I understood it.

5          Q   Do you know if any research was done after the

6     fact to confirm that the target percentage of 86 was in

7     fact accomplished?

8          A   What that was was an estimate based on  what

9     we know is that we hit 130 million packs of volume, and

10     we know enough about our consumer purchasing habits that

11     we believe that to be a reliable estimate.  I am not

12      aware that we did any follow-up research with individual

13     smokers.  To do that type of research would be  you

14     know, to confirm that number exactly would be very

15     extensive.  What we relied on were the estimates in

16     terms of what we thought we could reach, and we executed

17     a plan to do that.

18           Q   You had a plan that you developed based upon

19     assumptions, based upon data, and you projected you'd be

20     able to reach 86 percent, correct?

21          A   Based on the factors that I laid out earlier,

22     we estimated that packs with the onserts would reach 86

23     percent of the smokers of those low tar brands.

24          Q   And sitting here today, are you able to tell

25     us if you in fact reached that goal?

3390538160

3990538160pgNbr=128
Page

1          A   I can tell you that we put the onsert on 130

2     million packs of cigarettes.  And based on that, we

3     believe that that product was purchased by tens of

4     millions of smokers.

5          Q   You believe that product 

6              MR. LANHAM:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

7     interrupt.

8              MS. MILBURN:  I would ask you to let him

9     finish.

10          A   Tens of millions of smokers.

11          Q   When you use the phrase "reached," you mean

12     somebody purchased the pack with the onsert on it, don't

13     you?

14          A   That was the goal of our communication was to

15     make a pack with that onsert communication available to

16     smokers during that period of time and to reach as many

17     as possible.

18          Q   And in 2002 and 2003, did that program 

19     strike that.

20              If you'd look at Page 17, please, the 17 at

21     the bottom, the last four Bates numbers are 7292.  This

22     particular plan included a recommendation of six unique

23     onsert messages for execution in 2004, didn't it?

24          A   That's what this document  that first line

25     says "Recommend six (6) unique onsert messages in 2004"pgNbr=129
Page 129 f

1     for PM USA messaging.

2          Q   And if you look at the next page, "Potential              |

3     PMUSA Messaging Topics," it included:  "Cessation/                      

4     Addiction," that's one; "Cigarette Smoking and Disease,"          I

5     that's two; "Compensation (Lights)," that's three;                      f

6     "ETS," that's four.  Do you know what "ETS" stands for?            f

7          A   I believe it stands for environmental tobacco           f

8     smoke.                                                                                                                1

11     "Banded Paper (NY State)," do you what that refers to?              j

12          A   That refers, I believe, to a certain type of             f

13     cigarette paper that was designed related to fire safety         |

14     tests, and bands were included on the paper.  And New               |

15     York State had a law that may have taken place in 2003.            I

16     I don't recall the specific date that that went into                 |;

18     cigarettes to meet a certain fire safety test, and we               f

19     made it with banded paper.                                                                       j

20          Q   The third item down, Compensation, in parens,

21     Lights, that refers to the onserts that you were

22     involved with, the low tar, right?                                                      |

23          A   I'm not sure specifically what it refers to in         f

24     the context of this document.  Again, what it seems to              l

25     be is a potential list of topics.  But as I look further         jpgNbr=130
Page 130

1     back in the document, much of the stuff in here does not

2     appear to have been executed, so I don't know which

3     context that  exactly what that refers to.

4          Q   Take a look, please, at Page 23, the top,

5     "Approximate 2004 Onsert Volume Projections."  And what

6     is approximated here with regard to the "PMUSA Message"

7     is 22 billion cigarettes, that includes  the "PMUSA

8     Message" encompasses the low tar onserts, doesn't it?

9              MS. MILBURN:  Objection.

10          A   Again, if you look at this document, what this

11     is  this is a draft document, so I don't know what

12     this  to my knowledge, based on the limited pieces

13     I've seen, I know it includes a range of things that

14     were never enacted.  I think if you're interested in

15     knowing what percent  you know, what number of

16     specific executions of different onserts were included,

17     this is not the document I would use to rely on that.

18              For the Lights document, I would rely on the

19     information that I included in my affidavit.  So I have

20     no context in which to evaluate this because this is

21     just a proposal-  And based on what's in it, I can see

22     that there were elements of it that weren't executed.

23          Q   Apart from this document, when reference is

24     made to "PMUSA Message," that includes, among other

25     things, the low tar onsert message, though, doesn't it,pgNbr=131

1     apart from this document?

2              MS. MILBURN:  Objection.  Overbroad and vague.

3          A   I would not be comfortable saying what that

4     term would be used outside of the context of this

5     document.  As I noted earlier in other questions, I'm

6     not comfortable taking words from any single document

7     and applying them company-wide.

8          Q   Do you know who Ellen McCormick is?

9          A   Ellen McCormick?  No.

10          Q   No relation to you, Ellen C. McCormick?

11          A   No relation.  I don't know who that is. 12

13                (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 17 is

14              marked.) 15

16          Q   Give you Exhibit 17, which is an email string.

17     This refers in the Re line to "May LOOK," and Look is

18     all capital letters, L-O-O-K, dash, onserts.  Do you

19     know what that is referring to?

20          A   I'd like to read the document first.

21          Q   Sure.

22          A   Okay.

23          Q   Starting at the bottom, which is the first

24     email in the string, it is from a Craig Furtney to a

25     Laura Skarie.  Do you know who Mr. Furtney is?pgNbr=132
Page 132 j

1          A   I don't know him specifically.  I believe he             j

2     was somewhere in our sales organization.                                          |

3          Q         How about Laura Skarie?                                                         j

4          A   I don't remember where she is.  I vaguely                   i

5     remember the name, but I don't know her personally.                    I

6          Q   Do you know what the reference to "May LOOK,"            |

7     L-O-O-K, dash, onserts is referring to?                                            f

8          A   I don't know specifically.  But if you look at          1

9     the first line, he's saying "1 page of the May LOOK,"                f

10     that seems to be it's a May issue of a specific                            |

11     publication.  It says it's "to share information with                f

12     the field."  The field would refer to our sales                            |

13     organization.  So based on that, I would assume that                  |

14     it's some type of communication that's used to send to              f

15     our sales force.                                                                                           f

16          Q   And he's referring to share information "about          |

17     our onsert program," right?                                                                     f

18          A   That's what the second part of that sentence             j

19     says, "to share information, with the field, about our              |

20     onsert program."                                                                                           I

21          Q   At the very bottom, it's described as, "What              I

22     are they?" meaning onserts, "New vehicle to communicate           j

23     with adults who choose to smoke."  You. agree with that,

24     right?                                                                                                               |

1          A   I agree that what Craig is doing there, as he           j

2     notes in a note earlier, is that he's trying to come up           

3     with a definition of what that is.  And there's some                 f

4     other points in here that probably answer that a little            I

5     bit more completely.                                                                                   f

6          Q   As the email continues, eventually there is                j

7     one from a Zane Gibbs to Mr. Furtney and this Ellen                    f

8     McCormick.  Do you know who Mr. Gibbs is?                                        I

9          A   I know who Mr. Gibbs is.                                                      f

i

11          A   I know who he is, he's somebody that works in

12     our company.  I don't know what position he would have

13     been in at that point in time.

14          Q   Do you know what position he's in now?                          f

15          A   I don't.                                                                                       j

17     McCormick:  "In addition to Craig's comments below, let            j

18     me provide a somewhat lengthy discussion of onserts that          f

19     the two of you can edit."  Do you see the first Q and A?         1

1     Q.  The A is, (as read):  Onserts are small, open                        j

2     quotes, brochures, closed quotes, that are attached to             I

3     the back face of a pack of cigarettes.  They are affixed

4     directly on the pack and then overwrapped with our                     \

5     cellophane film wrap.                                                                                 f

7     that is your work with onserts  is that a correct way

8     of describing them?                                                                                     j

11          Q   Is that a correct way of describing onserts?

12          A   I would say that the way in which onserts are            j

13     described here are similar to the way I would describe             |

14     them.                                                                                                                  I

16     using onserts?"  Would you read the answer, please.

17          A   The answer is:  "Onserts are a new                                  f

18     communication tool that allows us to provide both                        i

19     branded and non-branded information directly to adult                I

20     smokers.  The onserts add another element to each

21     brand's promotion mix and also provide an additional

22     dimension to our Corporate Responsibility communications    I

23     mix."                                                                                                                 |

24          Q   Do you agree with that description or answer             f

25     to that question?pgNbr=135
Page 135 I

1          A   I agree that onserts are a communications tool          f

2     that enables us to communicate directly with adult                      1

3     smokers.  In this context, Zane appears to be kind of                |

4     tailoring the answer to a specific context that's in                 

5     response to Greg's request.  But the notion that onserts          f

6     are an effective way to directly reach adult smokers is            |

7     certainly something that I would agree with,                                  |

8          Q   And the next question, the question is:  "What          j

9     is the advantage of using onserts to communicate branded         |

10     messages?"  Would you read that answer, please.                            |

11          A   Answer is:  "For the brand groups, they

12     provide a much broader reach than direct mail because                I

13     adult smokers who are not currently on our database can            J

14     receive the communications.  In addition, these messages          f

15     are also available to competitive adult smokers who may           j

16     be considering one of our brands.  Onserts are also more         |

17     cost effective than other promotional communications

18     like direct mail."                                                                                       |

19          Q   Do you agree with that answer as drafted?                   

20          A   In the context of how we used onserts to                      f

21     communicate in the low tar situation, as I noted before,          I

22     it gives you really a broad reach with all of the people         i

23     who potentially purchase your brands at retail.  So in             j

24     that sense, that is broader than what you would be able           |

25     to accomplish with direct mail alone.                                                |pgNbr=136

1                  And I believe  I'm not that familiar with

2      the entire cost, this would be based on having general

3      knowledge  generally, I believe direct mail pieces are            |

4      more expensive than a specific brochure included in the               f

5      manufacturing operations, although I don't have a full                 f

15            A   The answer is:  "There are two distinct and                   f

6     2004 the brands will be using  this is actually how it

7     reads -- using to  TO  messages in a variety of ways

8     including, comma, pure equity, open parentheses,

9     primarily visuals, closed parentheses, messages, comma,

10     contests, slash, comma, sweepstakes, comma, bounce-back

11     offers to sign up on a direct mail data base, comma, and

12     communications about catalog items and other special

13     offers.

14          Q        Do you know what the "Focus on Four" brands

15     refers to?

16          A   The "Focus on Four" brands would have been our

17     four largest selling brands.  At the time I believe that

18     refers to Marlboro, Basic, Parliament, and Virginia

19     Slims.  So those are our four brands where at the brand

20     level they have the highest market share, and those were

21     the brands that were most likely to have promotional and

22     marketing support from us at the time.

23          Q   The next question here in the email is:  "How

24     often will onserts appear on packs at retail?"  Would

25     you read that answer, please.pgNbr=138
Page 138 |

1          A   Answer here is, (as read):  The timing of both

2     the corporate responsibility and marketing onsert

3     programs is somewhat complicated, however, comma, the

4     current plan is to have onserts appear on about 20

5     percent of our forecasted domestic volume throughout the

6     year.

7              In 2004 there are currently four CR messages,

8     open parentheses, one per quarter, closed parentheses,

9     in the plan that would appear at retail for about one

10     week on a variety of SKUs.  For marketing communications

11     by each brand, typical retail durations of each onsert

12     message are one to four weeks, however, comma, some

13     messages may appear for as long as eight weeks.

14              One brand, comma, Chesterfield, comma, is

15     unique in that nearly all of its volume will be onserted

16     each month in 2004.

17          Q   Says that "In 2004, there are currently four

18     CR messages (one per quarter)."  CR stands for corporate

19     responsibility, right?

20          A   In this context it appears to dc that, yes.

21          Q   And is one of the four the message of low tar,

22     no safe?

23          A   It would appear that it would be since in the

24     fourth quarter of 2004, we enclosed an onsert with that

25     message on approximately 118 million cigarette packs.pgNbr=139
Page

1          Q   And that would be one of the four referenced

2     here as one of the four CR messages, right?

3          A   I believe that to be the case, yes.

4          Q   I have three minutes to go, but I'm not going

5     to use it.  Thank you, sir.  I'm done.

6          A   Okay.  Thank you.

12                     EXAMINATION BY MS. MILBURN:

13

14          Q   Good afternoon, Mr. KcCormick.

15          A   Good afternoon.

16          Q   I'm going to ask you a few questions to follow

17     up on plaintiff's questions of you.  Ask you to pull out

18     Exhibit 9, which we looked at earlier today.  And turn

19     your attention to the page of that document that is

20     Bates numbered 1443, are the last four digits.

21              The document is entitled "PMUSA Ad Test (Phase

22     II) Focus Group Results."  Do you have the page?

23          A   My 1443 is this one.

24          Q    Yes.

25          A   Entitled "Tar and Nicotine (Onsert)."pgNbr=140
Page 140

1          Q   Yes, that's the correct page.  Mr. Lanham

2     asked you earlier in connection with Exhibit 9,   he

3     directed your attention to this page and asked if this

4     focus group that's described in this document was

5     evaluating a tar and nicotine or low tar onsert itself.

6              Do you remember that question and answer

7     series?

8          A   I do, and I told him that I didn't believe it

9     did.

10          Q   Based on your experience when you look at

11     focus group studies,- is there typically a section or a

12     summary that describes the types of communications that

13     are being tested in that focus group?

14          A   You would expect to see, either in some type

15     of overview of methodology or research design, an

16     overview of what was tested and how that  what it was

17     designed to do.  In this instance, in the page that ends

18     in Bates numbers 1431, there's a page called "Research

19     Design."

20          Q   Yes.  You've anticipated my next question.

21     What does that page describe where the communications

22     that were being tested and that were the subject of this

23     focus group report?

24          A   The description there indicates that groups

25     were first exposed to what are described as campaignpgNbr=141
Page 141 f

1      rollout ads, which if you look at the timing of this was            f

2      just prior to rolling out television and radio spots.                    f

3      It specifically, in parentheses, puts no safe in quotes,             f

4      ACQ in quotes, and non MSA omnibus in quotes.  And my                    j

5      belief is that those are references to various

6      executions under those categories.                                                                     f

7                  And it describes that respondents were then                    |

8      shown and discussed multiple developed concepts, which                 f

9      again I take to refer to those types of advertising.  It            |

10      lists the ads tested, so it lists specifically that                         f

11      there is a no safe, slash, low tar print ad, a print                       i

12      omnibus ad, two versions of a parent resource center ad,             I

13      raising kids who don't smoke, something that's called                    j

14      ETS, colon, kids.  There another ETS version in                                   |!

15      parentheses, guided by conclusions.  There are two tar                 f

16      and nicotine spots, one tar and nicotine, slash, no                         (

17      safe, and the second spot is described as tar and

18      nicotine, slash, onsert.  There are other spots that are            f

19      we card, no safe, slash, MSA, and a no safe radio spot.               f

20            Q   So am I correct that the list of ads that                         j

21      you've read off include a number of TV ads and one radio

22       spot?                                                                                                                                                        I

23            A And it also appears to include two print                           | 2 4              executions.                                                                                                                                | 25         Q   And based on the research design of this

1     study, were they testing onserts?

2         A   They were not testing onserts, they're testing         |

3     advertising.                                                                                                    |

4          Q   And one of the ad's titles that you read off             |

5     was tar and nicotine, slash, onsert?                                                  I

6         A   That's correct.                                                                         |

7          Q   Going back to Page 1443, is that ad described           f

8     on that page?                                                                                                 1

9          A   Not in detail, but at the top page it                            f

10     describes it as an ad  it says: (as read), The tar and         I

11     nicotine  those are in quotes -- ad that included                    |

12     information on the onsert fell out of the mix.  So based         f

13     on my experience in working with advertising, it's not              |

14     unusual to have two different executions of an ad that             |

15     you're trying to test.                                                                               j

16              The label that we would put in parentheses                  |

17     would be  you would try to distinguish them in some                I

18     way internally, and that would be the way in which you              I

19     would distinguish the difference between your television

20     spot that you're calling "no safe" and your television              |

21     spot that you're calling "onsert."  So what this says is          f

22     it included information in some way, shape, or form on              I

23     the onsert.                                                                                                           I

24          Q   If the focus group were testing onserts

25     themselves, as opposed to ads that refer to onserts,                  IpgNbr=143
Page 143

1     would you expect to see a reference to onserts on the

2     research design page?

3              MR. LANHAM:  Objection, foundation.

4          A   I would expect to see, based on my experience

5     with past documents, the type of information that we

6     were testing to be clarified based on the material.  So

7     in this instance, based on my experience, we do not use

8     the words "onsert" in advertising interchangeably.  So

9     the use of the word "advertising" leads me to believe,

10     along with the other points that I've mentioned  and

11     mentioned earlier  that what we were testing here 

12     as well as the timing of this  what we are testing

13     here are concepts of a print, radio, and television

14     campaign that rolled out shortly after that point in

15     time.  And as I noted in my affidavit, it began in 2003.

16          Q   I'd like to ask you another question about the

17     TV ads that you just referred to.  When did PM USA start

18     showing low tar, no safe cigarette ads on TV?

19          A   The year they began running was 2003.

20          Q   And where did those ads appear?

21          A   They ran nationwide.  They were designed to be

22     broad in their reach.  As I recall, they ran on a range

23     of prime time programs; at the time it was probably

24     programs like Fear Factor, whatever movie was on the

25     major networks, and a range of cable programs.  It

3390538176

3990538176pgNbr=144
Page 144

1     appeared on many of the news broadcasts, both the Today

2     Show, Good Morning America, and I believe also on some

3     of the evening news broadcasts as well.

4          Q   What was the goal of this TV campaign?

5          A   The goal was part of our ongoing efforts to

6     communicate broadly about tobacco issues by

7     incorporating TV into the mix specifically.  It enabled

8     you to have a very broad reach in terms of the number of

9     people who were exposed to the message that enabled you

10     to reach both the general public, and then certainly as

11     a subset of that, smokers with information that was

12     interesting to them as well. 13

14                (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 18 is

15              marked.) 16

17          Q        Mr. McCormick, showing you what's been marked

18     as  Exhibit 18, which is a two-page document.  First page

19     is Bates numbered 3034014029.  The second page bears a

20     Bates number of 3007287612.  Ask if you have ever seen

21     these two documents before?

22          A   Yes.  I would just note that they're two

23     separate documents,

24          Q   Yes, you are correct.  I've marked them

25     together because we're going to speak about thempgNbr=145

2          A   Okay.  Yeah, I've seen them before.                                j

3          Q   Let's look first at the document ending with             |

4     the Bates number 4029.  What is this document?                              f

5          A   What this appears to be is a summary of the                f

6     extent of our efforts, summarizing the placements that              |

7     we had in our television, print, and radio campaigns.                1

8     It lists the end market dates, the markets, and then                  |

9     includes some measures and indexes that look at the                    f

10     reach of those ads and the frequency of those ads.                      |

11          Q   Was this the corporate responsibility ad                     l

12     campaign?                                                                                                         f

13          A   Yes.                                                                                               |

14          Q   Was it for the period June of 2003 through                 >

15     November 13th, 2005?                                                                                   f

16          A   The first date I see is June 23, 2003.  The                I

17     last date on this document that we are sticking to is                f

18     November 13th, 2005.  The other document has some                        i

19     different numbers.                                                                                       f

20          Q   And did the corporate responsibility                              f

21     television, print, and radio ad campaign include no                    f

23          A    Yes, it did.                                                                               |

24          Q   I just would call your attention to No. 5, and    I

25     could you tell us what that line of the document is                    IpgNbr=146

1     telling us?

2          A   Sure.  What that refers to is the no safe, low

3     tar 30 second television ad, which would have been the

4     most visible, in terms of TV, element of this campaign             f

5     with that message.  This line refers to the fact that it         I

6     was in market during that period of time from November             |

7     17th to December 21st of 2003.  It was in market at both         f

8     the national level, and then on some spot television in           j

9     the state of California as well.                                                           |

10          Q   Now, the next three columns I want to ask you            \

11     about individually.  What is the  do you know what the          f

12     column that's called "Frequency" refers to?                                    I

13          A   It's my understanding that refers to the                      j

14     estimated amount of times that our intended audience is           I

15     estimated to have seen that ad based on the buy.                          |

16          Q   And what does the column immediately to the                |

17     left called "A18+ Reach," what does that category refer            I

18      to?                                                                                                                                                 jj

19          A   What that refers to is the estimated                              I

20     population of those adults who are 18 and over that                    |

21     watch TV that you're estimated to reach with your                        f

22     advertising.                                                                                                   I

23          Q   So for No. 5, the low tar 30 second ad, what              |

24     was the frequency that was expected viewers  the                      !;

25     number of times viewers would see the ad?pgNbr=147
Page 147 |

1          A   We expected that viewers would see that ad                 J

2     approximately 7.6 times, would be the frequency that we            f

3     were shooting for.                                                                                       |

4          Q   What percentage of viewers did you expect to

5     reach?                                                                                                               f

6          A   Based on the buy, with a national buy, we                    1

7     expected to reach 82 percent of that 18-plus audience                f

8     from a reach standpoint.  So to put that in shorthand to         I

9     sum it up, we expected to reach 82 percent of the adult           I

10     television watching audience and have them see this spot          |

11     on average 7.6 times.                                                                                 |

12          Q   And the column immediately to the left of the            j

13     reach columns labeled "A18 + TRPs," what are TRPs?

14          A   TRPs is a term used in the advertising                          f

15     business, particularly as it relates, in this context,              j

16     of television.  It means total rating points, and it's a         |

17     measure of your total audience.  And I understand that's          j

18     calculated by multiplying your frequency times your                    I

19     estimated reach.  So that number is the result  the                f

20     product of those other two factors put together.                          f

21          Q   So it's a product of multiplying 82 percent                f

22     times 7.6?                                                                                                       f

23          A    That's my understanding.                                                      j

24          Q   And the number given for Line No. 5 is 624?                |

25          A    That's correct.                                                                         IpgNbr=148

1          Q   Based on your knowledge of ad campaigns and               |

2     determining ratings for those campaigns, how do you                    f

3     value this  evaluate this particular advertisement?                |

4              MR. LANHAM:  Objection to form.                                        |

5          A   I would say based  let me kind of first                    f

6     describe my experiences in this regard to give a context         f

7     on which to evaluate my answer.  I'll base my response             f

8     on two things, you know, general involvement in the                   f

9     communications field, and, you know, what is occasional            |

10     benchmarking against other campaigns and asking                            f

11     questions to gain an understanding of it, as well as                  |

12     conversations I had at the time with those who are                      f

13     involved in planning this  this campaign.                                    j

14              And at those levels, this is designed to be a           j

15     campaign that is broad in its reach.  It is likely to               j

16     have a greater frequency than many other campaigns that            j

17     are out there, but is probably on the lines of some of             f

18     the more prominent ads that are on TV,  And when you                 j

19     look at kind of those rating points for that point in                |

20     time, it's very significant in its scope, and it's at                I

21     the higher end of what you would typically expect to see         f

22     for a television campaign.                                                                         I

23          Q   If you would take a look at No. 11 and tell us          I

24     what the information on that line is telling us,                           I

25          A    This is  it says, (as read):  No safe,                      jpgNbr=149

1     slash, low tar, slash, REV, which I would interpret as

2     to indicate that it was slightly different from the

3     prior spot; it was a 30 second spot.  That spot ran from

4     October 25th to November 28th, 2004, on national TV.

5                And then if you continue down that column, you

6     had total rating points of 750.  A reach estimating that

7     you are reaching eighty-three percent of your adult

8     audience with a frequency of about nine times.

9           Q   So again, you're reaching eighty-three percent

10     of viewers who are viewing that particular ad nine

11     t ime s ?

12          A   You would expect that they would see it nine

13     times, yes.

14           Q   And multiplying those two numbers together,

15     the 83 times 9 gives you the 750?

16          A   Gets you roughly the 750, as I understand it.

17          Q   If you would look at the second page of

18     Exhibit 18, which bears the last four digits 7612.  And

19     calling your attention to Lines 5 and Lines 11, do those

20     basically contain the same information as we just

21     reviewed on the previous page?

22           A         It includes everything up until the TRP point,

23     but: the TRP numbers listed here  for Line 5 are the

24     same that are listed in the previous page you gave me.

25           Q    So it lists the TRPs, but it does not list thepgNbr=150

1     reach or frequency?                                                                                     j

2          A   That's correct.                                                                         j

3          Q   But your understanding is that the TRP is a                j

4     function of multiplying reach and frequency together?                f

5         A   And the TRP is the same number that you have              |

6     here exactly, so that's just a little bit more detail in         |

7     that first document that was presented to me.                                j

8          Q   Mr. McCormick, Mr. Lanham showed you a                          j

9     document that was marked as Exhibit 5, which was a                      f

10     one-page document.  And I noted at the time that it                    f

11     appeared to be part of a document.  I would like to show

12     you the entire document and have that marked as Exhibit            |

13       19.                                                                                                                                                           I

14                                                              [

15                (McCormick Deposition Exhibit NO. 19 is                      |

16              marked.)                                                                                       |

18          Q   You can take a moment to look at it.  Calling

19     your attention to the second page of the document, you              |

20     testified in response to Mr. Lanham's questions that the          I

21     onsert program was intended to reach 80 percent of the             f

22     smokers of the onserted brands.  And in fact, is that                f

23     number referenced on the second page?                                                 I

24          A   On the second page there's a chart that lists            j

25     the estimated reach of both the pack onsert and outsert,          fpgNbr=151
Page 151

1     as well as media, which in this context  or the prior

2     page refers to the free-standing insert that's mentioned

3     in my affidavit.  The estimated reach for the pack

4     cnsert here is listed as 86 percent of Philip Morris low

5     tar adult smokers.  The number that's given there is

6     12.5 million adult smokers, so the 86 number is

7     consistent with my recollection.

8                And then the media with the free-standing

9     insert, which is a newspaper communication referred to

10     in my affidavit, was estimated to reach 27.8 million

11     adults.  On the first page they estimate that that would

12     reach 6.1 million adult smokers.  And then based on this

13     analysis, they estimate that eliminating any

14     overlapping  it looks like they're eliminating any

15     overlap, an additional two percent of Philip Morris low

16     tar smokers are another 300,000, for a total reach for

17     those two communications of about 88 percent of Philip

18     Morris adult low tar smokers.  So that would be 12.8

19     million, and they note their total estimate here is

20     14.5.

21                MS. MILBURN:  Thank you.  That's all I have.

22                MR. LANHAM:  I have a couple of follow-up

8     there are no more no safe, low tar ads, are there?

9          A   That specific ad is not listed there, no.

10           Q   So with regard to the two that you are being

11     questioned about, with regard to line items 1 through 21

12     on the first page, and Lines 1 through 25 on the second

13     page, there are two no safe, slash, low tar ads,

14     correct?

15          A   That is the description used for those ads,

16     yes.

17          Q   And each  the first one ran November 17th to

18     December 21 in 2003, right?

19          A   Yes.

20          Q   And the second one ran October 25 to November

21     28th, 2004, correct?

22          A   That's correct.

23           Q   And so from June 2003 until December 3 of

24     2006, two-and-a-half-year span, there are two runs for

25     that ad, aren't there?

1          A   For that specific ad.  And then the second                 f

2     version of that appears to be slightly different, so                  f

3     they may be two slightly different ads.                                             |

4          Q   But that's it for that two-and-a-half-year                  |

5     time frame, isn't it?                                                                                 |

6          A   For that specific ad.  Again, what I don't                  I

7     know is whether those issues  the other issues that                f

8     are general health messages, general smoking cessation              f

9     messages, what I don't know just from the shorthand here         |

10     is whether those specifically mentioned low tar                            f

11     cigarettes at all.  Some of them reference a no safe                  |

12     message, and all of them direct people back to the                      |

13     website, which was available in this time with extensive         |

14     information on smoking and health issues and low tar --            \

15     including low tar.                                                                                       I

16          Q         Some of them reference addiction, causation,              |

17     and quitting,, don't they?                                                                         I

They do.                                                                                       j

1           Q   PRC, slash, raising?

2          A   Yes.

3           Q   What is PRC?

4          A   PRC is the parent resource center.

5          Q   Another one, no safe, slash, ACQ.  What does

6     ACQ mean?

7          A   I believe that is shorthand for addiction,

8     causation, and quitting.

9           Q   Another one for PRC, slash, peer review,

10     right?

11          A   The version  are you looking at Line 10?

12           Q   I am.

13          A   PRC, slash, Peer Pressure.

14          Q   Sorry, I misstated that.  That has nothing to

15     do with low tar, does it?

16          A   That's a parent resource center spot.

17          Q   Doesn't have anything to do with low tar, no

18     safe, does it?

19          A    It does not.

20           Q   Line 12, "Access Prevention," right?

21          A   Correct.

22          Q         Line 13, "Access Prevention Revised."  They

23     have nothing to do low tar, no safe, do they?

24          A   They probably do not.

25           Q    And Line 14 says "Three Points," what is thatpgNbr=156

9          Q   Okay, fair enough.  Now, when you look at Page          |

10     2, compare it to Page 1, it takes us beyond the  let              I

11     me back up.  The end date on Page 1 is November 13th,

12     2005; do you see that?                                                                               I

13          A   Yes, that's the last date I see on that.                      |

14          Q   And if you look at Page 2, the end date is                  I

15     December 3th, 2006, which is just a little more than an            |

16     additional year, isn't it?                                                                       f

17          A   Yes.                                                                                                       I

18          Q   And in that additional year, there's not one             1

19     single TV ad that was run entitled no safe, slash, low             f

20     tar, is there?                                                                                               I

21          A   As I mentioned earlier, the specific low tar             f

22     spot that was run earlier was not there.  What I can't

23     say for certain is whether the ads that reference health         f

24     effects or quitting, for example, may have also included         j

25     reference to that information from a television                            IpgNbr=157
Page 157 I

1     standpoint.  What I also don't know is whether any of                f

2     the print spots that ran during that 2005 period of time          (

3     with serious health effects, they may also have included         I

4     references to low tar cigarettes, but. I don't know for              f

5     sure.

6          Q    I didn't ask you about print ads, did I?                      f

7          A   You were asking me about advertising, I wanted         |

8     to make sure I was being responsive to your question.                |

9          Q   Let me ask the question again:  Limiting your            |

10     answer to TV ads, for that extra  little more than one

11     year that takes us to that end date of December 3, 2006,          I

12     there's not a single ad that is listed as no safe, slash         f

13     low tar?                                                                                                           f

14              MS. MILBURN:  Objection, asked and answered.              f

15          A   I did answer that question.  There are four                f

16     more ads, I believe, that are listed there.  And as I                j

17     mentioned, there's a quitting ad and a. health effects                I

18     ad.  This specific ad, as I noted, was not running at                f

19     that period of time, but I could not tell you whether or         f

20     not a low tar message was included in two of those other

21     ads.                                                                                                                    |

22              MR. LANHAM:  Okay.  I have nothing further.                \

23     Thank you.                                                                                                       |

25          AND FURTHER THIS DEPONENT SAITH NOT                                          IpgNbr=158
Page 158 1

2                MS. MILBURN:  During the deposition today

3     there was testimony concerning highly confidential

4     documents, and also such documents were marked as

5     exhibits.  So under the protective order, I ask that the

6     whole deposition be deemed highly confidential and ask

7     the court reporter to place a legend on the first page

8     of the transcript --

9                -~ and I will give you the language of the

10      legend and give you a copy as well.

11                MR. LANHAM:  I have to respond to that, and

12     here's what has occurred:  I used a document that is

13     what you understand to be highly confidential that we

14     obtained from the litigation website, not as highly

15     confidential but as confidential.

16                The documents that you provided me today that

17     were the highly confidential documents that I had

18     e-mailed Judy about included one and the same for which

19      I used.  So I did not use -- it's the same document,

20     it's the exact same document, but I accessed it

21     initially off of the litigation website as a

22     confidential document.

23                Then this morning when  you remember I

24     reviewed these, and 1 was going through them, 1 realized

25     that, well, the one that I am going to use here as an

3990538191

399053819pgNbr=159
Page 159

1     exhibit is already in my stack that is not highly

2     confidential.

3              Does that  if that makes sense to you, I'd

4     have to take the position it's not a highly confidential

5     document because it has, by your client's own website, a

6     confidential designation; and therefore, we do not have

7     to term or deem the entire transcript highly

8     confidential.

9              MS. MILBURN:  My position is still that the

10     document is highly confidential.  And what I would

11     suggest that we do, given that you say that you found a

12     copy on the website, is keep this transcript highly

13     confidential for the present and see if we can sort out

14     why you were able to find it on the website.  But my

15     understanding, it is a highly confidential document, and

16     the testimony about it would be also be highly

17     confidential.  So'I do want to seal the transcript for

18     that reason.

19              MR. LANHAM:  Can we seal the transcript with

20     regard to the line of questioning that pertained to that

21     particular document and his testimony?  That would be

22     very fair until we sort this out.  There's no reason to

23     seal the entire transcript when only one item and one

24     line of questioning concerning the one item is at issue.

25     And I'm perfectly agreeable to having that portion ofpgNbr=160
Page 160 

1     the transcript sealed for now in order to protect and

2     respect what may be a legitimate issue for you.

3                MS. MILBURN:  I think the protective order

4     speaks to that, and what it says is that there is a

5     period -- the transcript is sealed in its entirety, and

6     then there is a period to do exactly what you've

7     described.

8                And what I would prefer to do, and what I

9     recommended that we do is we seal it in its entirety,

10     and then we proceed when the process that you described,

11     which is consistent with the protective order, which is

12     narrow any sealing so the entire transcript need not be

13     permanently sealed.

14                MR. LANHAM:  Let me explain on the record why

15     this is important, and I think you know where I'm

16     headed.  We have a deadline of March 31st to prepare our

17     opposition.  And the way the thing is set up right now

18     is only a select number of lawyers are allowed to have

19     access to highly confidential documents, of which I'm

20     one of them.  But there are going to be other lawyers in

21     other law firms that are working on the opposition

22     submission that are not necessarily on that list of

23     lawyers who are entitled to have access to highly

24     confidential documents.  And with the days literally

25     running, and here it is March the 12th, and our

1     opposition is due the 31st, we have to be preparing it               I

2     ahead of time, we have to circulate drafts, you fully                 I

3     understand how that works.  You know, if you can                            j

4     represent to me that we can resolve this without having            I

5     to prolong it by Monday, by the close of business on                   f

6     Monday, then I will go along with that way of dealing                 |

7     with it.                                                                                                                     |

8                MS. MILBURN:  I will represent to you that we             I

9     will address this immediately on Monday morning.                             f

10                MR. LANHAM:  Well, you can't beat that.  Okay.           j

11                MS. MILBURN:  What I'm not sure of, and I'm                 |

12      just going through the exhibits, is to determine whether    [

13     there was only one highly confidential document.  I                     f

14     believe there may have been two.                                                                I

15                Mr. Lanham, there is just the one document,                  I

16     Exhibit 8, which is highly confidential.  And we should             f

17     be able to resolve this by close of business Monday.                    j

18                MR. LANHAM:  Who do I deal with, you or                          I

19     someone else?                                                                                                          f

20                MS. MILBURN:  You will in the first instance               jj

21     deal with me, and I will bring my colleague, Judy                          j

12    EXAMINATION BY

13   MR. GOLDFARB:

14         Q.   Good morning, Mr. Berlind.  I introduced

15   myself.  For the record, my name is Andrew

16   Goldfarb.  I represent the United States in the

17    United States versus Philip Morris, Incorporated,

18    et al. that is referenced by the videographer, and

19    I just want to note that I'm not sure I heard the

20    case number right, but it's No. 99-2496,

21               MR. GOLDFARB:  And, Ms. Ragsdale, you

22         just want to state your name for the record. 2 3                                MS. RAGSDALE:  Certainly.  Cheryl

2        Q.   Mr. Berlind, have you ever been

3   deposed before?

4        A.   No, I haven't.

b                  Q.    I'll just go over some ground rules, so

6    that the deposition can go smoothly and the record

7    can be as clear as possible, for how we will

8   proceed today.  I'll obviously be asking questions

9    and you respond.  If there's a question that you do

10    not understand, please ask me to clarify and I wi11

11    do so to the best of my ability.  If you do not ask

12    me to clarify a question, I will assume that you

13    understood it.  Is that clear?

14         A.    Yes.

15        Q.    I ask that you not respond in -- via

16    non-verbal communication with nods or um-hums,

17    since obviously the court reporter has a difficult

18    time ascertaining your answer, can't take down

19    non-verbal communications.

20        A.    Okay.

21         Q.    I ask that if you remember additional

22    information later in the deposition that's

23    responsive to a question that I asked earlier, that

24    you provide the information at that time.  It's not 2E>        a test where you have to get everything out in

2   department?

3        A.    Yes, sir.

4        Q.    So the worldwide regulatory affairs !>       is -- at that time when you joined was a

6   subdivision of the PM.MC legal department?

7        A.    Yes, I think that would be accurate.  It

8   was a little bit of a unique group within the legal

9   department, because it was led by a lawyer, it had 1(1       a lot of lawyers in it, it performed a lot of legal

11   advice-giving functions and had a lot of legal

12   tasks.  At the same time it's a regulatory affairs

13   group, it also had people who were not lawyers who

14   worked on other aspects of regulatory issues,

15   obviously nonlegal aspects as well.

16        Q.    And was the worldwide regulatory affairs

17   a group within Philip Morris Companies?  Can you

18   explain where  how worldwide regulatory affairs

19   and your position at PMMC fit into the Philip

20   Morris family of companies?

21        A.    Yes, I'll do my best.

22             The Philip Morris Companies is the

23   parent company, Philip Morris, Companies Inc., of

24   the entire group.  That's the listed company on the 2 5       New York Stock Exchange.  And in the most kind of

I'agc 9

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   simplified version of the structure, I'm sure

3   there's a lot of different subcompanies and

4   whatnot, but the basic entities that it holds are

5   what we refer to internally as the operating

6   companies, which are Philip Morris USA, Philip

7   Morris International, Kraft Foods, Miller Beer,

8   some others as well, and a service company, a

9   services company, called Philip Morris Management

10   Corp., the company that I work for, PMMC, which, if

11   it's okay, I'll just refer to it as that today.

12             PMMC provides all sorts of services to

13   the operating companies, including legal services.

14   So most people in the law department reside or are

15   employed by PMMC to provide legal services to the

16   operating companies, just as corporate affairs and

17   government affairs employees tend to reside in PMMC

18   to provide those kind of services to the operating

19   companies.

20             The little bit of complexity, in terms

21   of trying to answer your question, is that the PM

22   Companies itself is a very small company in terms

23   of the number of employees.  The holding company.

24   There are a few companies who are employees of

25   PM Companies, including the general counsel of

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=199
Page 10

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2   PM Companies.  And the legal department, what we

3   refer to as the legal department or the law

4   department, which is almost entirely PMMC

b       employees, ultimately report into general counsel

6   of PM Companies, and it's not just the general

7   counsel who is a PM Companies employee.

8              At the time I joined WRA, for example,

9   that would be worldwide regulatory affairs, the

10   head of WRA is a lat^yer, Mark Firestone, but his

11   title was associate general counsel of

12   PM Companies, I believe.  So he was a PM Companies

13   employ  executive and an attorney.

14        Q.   When you joined Philip Morris in 1996,

15   Mark Firestone was the head of WRA?

16        A.    That is right, yes.

17        Q.    What were you doing before you joined

18    Philip Morris?

19        A.    The immediate job before that was 1 was

20   the vice president and general counsel of a

21   management consulting and information technology

22   group here in the States called Gemini Consulting

23   and Cap Gemini  it's since changed its name and

24   merged with Ernst & Y^ung, but it is a Paris-based

25   international consulting firm  was the general

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    counsel of the US operations.

3              And prior to that I was at Cleary

4    Gottlieb here in New York.

b                  Q.          How long were you at Cleary Gottlieb?

6        A,   I think about three years.

7        Q.    That was beginning when?

8        A.    That would have been beginning in '87.

9    So   '87 to '90 at Cleary Gottlieb.  1996 at

10    Gemini  Cap Gemini.

11         Q.    When you were at Cap Gemini, did you

12    have any contact with Philip Morris?  Did it

13   provide consulting services, for example, to Philip

14    Morris?

15        A.    I had no personal contact with Philip

16    Morris, but I was aware that  and they're two

17    different businesses, without trying to

18    overcomplicate it, the Gemini Consulting part was

19    kind of traditional management consulting, what you

20    think of as MacKenzie type strategic consulting.

21    The Cap Gemini part is 1 think, most

22    simplistically, thought of as computer consulting, 2 3        computer programming, that kind of thing.  Gemini

24    Consulting had had a contact or engagement with

25    Philip Morris USA that I don't think I ever was

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   called upon to render any services or advice with

3   respect to, and indeed I think that the engagement

4   kind of ended pretty early during my tenure with

5   the company.

6        Q.    You mentioned it was a Paris-based, that

7   Gemini was a Paris-based company.

8             Did you spend any period of time when

9   you were with them living outside the States?

10        A.   Not living.  I spent a fair amount of

11   time over there.  I made frequent trips to the

12   headquarters in Paris.

1 3                             Like I said, depends what you mean by

14   living.  There was a time, there was an initial

15   period when I first joined them when I was over in

16   Paris for a few months.  I never moved there or

17   anything, but they brought me in for kind of

18   orientation where I kind of lived in a hotel for a

19   few months and didn't come back, but that was just

20   an extended business trip, I would say.

21        Q.    Just tell me again, what was your

22   position at Gemini?

23        A.    I was the vice president and U.S.

24   general counsel.  So general counsel of the U.S.

2 5       subsidiaries I think would be the most accurate way

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=202
Page 13

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    of describing it.

3               I also rendered advice to the parent

4    company, the French companies, with respect to U.S.

5   matters that they were concerned with, and also on

6    international acquisitions I had at that time some

7    experience with MSA and they were doing some

8    acquisitions at the time in Europe, so I helped out

9   on that.

10         Q.    Just generally, what was the nature of

11    the advice that you were providing?

12         A.    It was truly, it was genera] counsel,

13    very small legal department.  I think at its height

14    I had maybe two other people working for me, so it IT)        ran the gamut from contracts, I mean services

16    contracts, that was the most, the bulk of it,

17    employment matters, employment disputes, EEOC

18    complaints, sometimes commercial disputes,

19    secretary of their stock option plan.

20               Like I said, they were in kind of an M&A

21    or mergers and acquisitions mode, so deal advice.

22    So just anything, any legal issues that they had to

23    deal with were my responsibility to deal with,

24    either myself or through the retention of outside 2b        counsel.

2        Q.    What was the nature of the work you did

3   at Cleary Gottlieb?

A                  A.    Well, it was  I'd say it was

b       concentrated on M&A or mergers and acquisitions.

6   There were a lot of  there's a lot of hostile

7   takeovers going on back then, and a lot of my work

8   involved both hostile and friendly deals and some

9   banking syndicate work as well.

10       Q.    Did you do any litigation? 3.1        A.          I did not.

12        Q.    Did Cleary Gottlieb do any work for the

13   Philip Morris companies, to your knowledge?

14        A.   They did.  I had no connection to it.

15   In fact, I only learned subsequently, when I came

16   to work for PMMC, that the Brussels office in

17   particular of Cleary Gottlieb had kind of a

18   long-standing relationship with PM International.

19   And I'm not exactly sure what they had done

20   historically, but there had been some work, yes.

21        Q.   How did you come to move to PMMC?

22        A.    It was a cold call from a headhunter.

23        Q.    When you started working in March of

24    1996, when did you receive the call from the

25   headhunter, if you remember?

Page 15

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2        A.    I remember it was a fairly long time

3   before that.  It was not a fast recruiting process.

4    So I would say it was in the fall of '95.

5        Q.   Why did you make the move?

6        A.    I had been at Gemini and Cap Gemini for

7    over five years at that point and was very

8    comfortable there but felt that it was a little

9   dull.  I mean, you know, I described the work to

10    you, it was pretty basic nuts and bolts.  It was

11    very exciting for me when I first got there to have

12    my own shop to run and be the general counsel and

13   be the boss and-the wheel of the department, but

14    ultimately beyond the M&A deals, which were a lot

15    of fun to work on, the legal issues they had were

16    pretty routine and not that challenging.  So it was

17    the kind of thing that was a very comfortable job

18    and got to be a very easy job, but I was starting

19    to think, you know, in the 1995 period, you know,

20    gee, is this what I really just want to do for the

21    rest of my career.  And I thought no, I should be 2.2        open to trying some other things.  So I had been 

23    I hadn't been really actively been looking, but you

24    know how those calls can come in and in previous

25   periods I had not listened to them, but I was

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538237

3990538237pgNbr=205
Page 16

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    starting to listen to them at that time.  And when

3    the call came for this job it certainly sounded

4    different and interesting.

5         Q.   Do you  why was Philip Morris looking

6    to hire people in WRA 

7               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection, i!       Q.           department?

9                               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

10       A.   Well, I wasn't there or I wasn't the

11.        decision-maker as to what they were about, but what

12    I can tell you, I don't know what their intent was

13    in hiring me specifically, but I can tell you that

14    at that time WEIA was not a brand-new department but

15    a fairly new department still.  I think it was

16    fairly recently that Mark Firestone had joined it, 1?        and at the time there was only one other  aside

18    from Mark, there was only one other lawyer in the

19    department, and so they were staffing up a bit.

20               There were a lot of regulatory issues

21    going on.  It was at the time of the FDA rulemaking

22    where Dr. Kessler and the FDA at that time had

23    proposed to regulate cigarettes as a medical

2 4          device.  That was a verv time-consuming project for

2 5          that group  for that department.  At the same

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=206
Page 17

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   time OSHA had just concluded a rulemaking hearing

3   relating to indoor air quality.   So I guess ihe

A       most basic surmise I could give on that was there

5   was a lot going on, and they felt like they needed

6   some more help, and indeed after I got there they

7   wound up hiring more people in addition to me.

8        Q.         Did they hire more lawyers in addition

9   to you?

10        A.   Yes, they did.

11        Q.    Who else did they hire in the general

12   period in which you were hired?

13        A.    You want me to take you through the :ive

14   years?  Right after -- there was no one there for lb       six to 12 months after I got there 

16        Q.         I'm sorry to interrupt.

17        A.    That's all right.

18        Q.   Who was the other lawyer besides

19   Mr. Firestone who was in the WRA when you were

20   hired?

21        A.   When I was hired the other lawyer was

22   named Roger Whidden, W-H-I-D-D-E-N.

2 3        Q.    How many people were in the WRA

24   department, total, when you joined?

25        A.    I wouldn't want to try to give you an

Esquire Deposition Services 1 -800-944-9454

3390538239

3990538239pgNbr=207
Page 18

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    exact number that's accurate, but there were at:

3    least five or six non-lawyers that I can think of

4    that were in the department.  And there were a

5    couple, what they called secondees, meaning people

6   who weren't officially employed by the department

7    but were kind of on loan to the department from

8    other parts of the company.  So there was a group

9   of, you know, 10 or 12 people at least in the group 10        at the time.

3 1       Q.          Did you report directly to Mark

12    Firestone?

13        A.   No.  When I joined I was reporting to

14    Mr. Whidden.

lb                  Q.   When you first arrived at Philip Morris,

16    what was the nature of the work? Can you describe

17    your duties?

18         A.    Yes, I'll try to think back that far.

19    The first thing that -- I mean the first duties

20    that I had, and I remember being a little surprised

21    by this, but also gratified by it, becciuse it. was

22    just so different for me to be in a big company and 2 3        a big legal department as opposed to a small shop

24    that I had come from.  They literally let me take

25    the first few months to familiarize myself with

Esquire Deposition Services 1-8M-944-9454pgNbr=208
Page 19

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   what had been going on.  There are volumes and

3   volumes of regulatory submissions and things across A       all sorts of issues that, the group in the

5   department had been working on, and I really wai>

6   given the opportunity  that's not all I did, but

7   I have a strong memory of sitting around reading

8   all that and having the luxury of doing that.

9   That's how I kind of got started.

10             The first regulatory matter that I was

11   asked to engage on directly was the aftermath o):

12   the OSHA indoor air quality rulemaking, which, if

13   it makes sense for you, I can refer to as IAQ when

14   it comes up again.  What had happened is OSHA had

15   proposed to regulate -- a national rule to regulate

16   indoor air quality.  They had opened the record for

17   comments, written comments had been submitted --

18   this was all before I arrived at the company, but

19   right before, and indeed I believe that the

20   hearings that OSHA held and they did have live

21   hearings that wound up going on for quite some

22   time, I think four or five or six months, those had

23   ended shortly before I arrived at the company.  I 2 4       don't remember exactly when they ended, but the

25       hearings had ended and what was still going on was

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538241

3990538241pgNbr=209
Page 20

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2   that there was post-hearing submissions that PMMC

3   was filing, so I did get involved in that to some

4   degree.  And then there was follow-up meetings and

5   discussions within the company in terms of --

6   everyone was expecting OSHA to sort of continue

7   that rulemaking, so the team of people that had

8   been working on the OSHA rulemaking were still, it

9   was still like a functioning team, so I joined

10   that, and that was the first thing of kind of

11   active engagement that I remember working on.

12        Q.         Were there any other  so the OSHA IAQ

13   matter was the first one there.

14              Were there other issues on which you

15   were working in your initial period at WRA?

16        A.   Yes.  I mean what period are you

17   interested? What do you consider the initial

18   period?

19        Q.    You arrived in March of 1996 and you

20   testified that you were working on the indoor air

21   quality issue.

22              Was that consuming a hundred percent of

23   your time, other than your sort of initial

24    orientation/reading period?

25        A.    Well, I don't want to say 100 percent,

2   but it was consuming most of it and it was not

3   helpful to you let me know, but in terms of where

4   there was a major shift and when I became actively f>       involved in something else so I started splitting

6   my time more definitively was in the summer of '96.

7   So if that's past the initial period, I don't know.

8   But in the summer of '96 there was a legislation

9   passed in Massachusetts that would have required

10   the submission of by-brand cigarette ingredient

11   information, including all of the brand recipes,

12   and the statute required that the government

13   agency, after it collected them, that it make the

14   brand list public, so there was activity around

15   that project.  Now that I was working and providing ]i        legal advice with respect to and ultimately after

17   the statute was passed and I guess before the

18   statute was passed there was a legislative effort

19   in terms of trying to work with people up there to

20   advocate a more reasonable statute.  But once it

21   was passed, it became a matter for litigation and I

22   became the in-house attorney who was on point for 2 3         or responsible for working on the litigation over

24   the Massachusetts ingredients statute.

25        Q.   Why was the Massachusetts legislation

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   unreasonable, in your view?

3   D1R       MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.  Instruct tne

4        witness not to answer.

5             To the extent the answer nay disclose

6        legal advice, I'm going to order the witness

7        not to answer until we are able to determine

8        whether or not it involves legal advice.

9        Q.         Are you going to take the advice of

10   counsel?

11        A.   Yes.

12             MR. GOLDFARB:  I'm going to register an

13        objection and ask:

14        Q.   With the advice of counsel, are you able

15   to answer the question?

16   DIR       MR. FREDERICK:  I'm going to object and

17        instruct the witness not to answer, on the

18        grounds that the witness* answer may tend to

19        disclose legal advice, and he's not in a

20        position to make that decision himself.

21             If you want, me to voir dire the

22        witness or discuss the matter with the

23        witness out of the room, I'll agree to that,

24        but otherwise I'm qoing to instruct the 2b                 witness not to answer.

2         A.    In my personal view, the legislation as

3    it stood at that time was unreasonable, because it

4    would have  it wasn't just about collecting

5    ingredients information for the State.  The idea

6    and the object and the operation of the statute was

7    to publish all the brand recipes, including the

8    flavorings.

9               If you look at a bag of potato chips, it

10    lists major ingredients, but then it says flavoring

11    spices and colors.  That's so that the recipe part,

12    the flavoring part, so that competitors can't copy

13    the information and replicate the brands.  That's

14    all protected as trade secrets.  This statute would

15    not have done that.  It explicitly would have m^de

16    all of the flavorings public records, to be

17    published on the website of the state.

IB       Q.    Does your view differ from the company's

19    view?

20         A.    In terms of what Philip Morris USA's

21    view was, I'd say no, that that was their view as

22    well.  But I would supplement it, with respect to 2 3         them, by saying that the company not only at that

24    time was more than willing to provide information

25    to the State, if it was to be protected as

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=214
Page 25

1                      Berlind - Confidential

2    proprietary trade secret information, it wound up

3    publishing  once it put a website up, it wound up

4    publishing brand-specific ingredients information,

!:>        again, like you would find on a potato chip pack or

6   a can of Coke that gives the public and consumers

7    ingredient information but just keeps the flavoring

8    part protected to the same degree that other

9    products protect it.

10           0.   Was the  was your work, as I think you

11     referred to it, as in-house counsel or point person

12    on the Massachusetts legislation issue and

13    litigation that came out of it, was that your first

14     litigation experience?

15          A.            With Philip Morris Management Corp.?

16           Q.    Yes.

17           A.    Yes, it was.

18           Q.    Was all of your prior litigation

19    experience with Gemini?

2 0        A.          Yes.  I didn't do any at Cleary

21    Gottlieb, and  yes, yes.

22         Q.    You said that the work that you were 2 3         doing on the Massachusetts legislation was for 2 4          Philip Morris USA; is that correct?

2 5       A.    Well, I was employed by Philip Morris

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538247

3990538247pgNbr=215

2   Management Corp. or PMMC.  A lot of the folks I was

3   working with, I mean I'm in PMMC, the government

4    affairs people who were conducting the lobbying

5   effort, they were PMMC; but we were all performing

6    that work on behalf of, in effect, our client,

7   which in that matter was PM USA, Philip Morris USA.

8        Q.    Do you keep track of the work you do for

9   different operating companies, or did you when you

10   were at PMMC?

11               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

12        A.    When you say "keep track of," could

13    you explain further.

14         Q.    Sure.  To the extent that you referred

15    to different operating companies, perhaps, as

16    different clients, did you track the time you spent.

17    servicing the different clients by distinguishing

18    among them?

19        A.    I see what you are saying.  Not in a

20    time-keeping kind of way, not in the way that a law

21    firm would keep time records, no, we don't do that.

22    However, we keep track of it in terms of, you know,

23    reporting it to our bosses and discussing it at

24    departmental meetings where we' are doing this, we

25    are doing that.  It's not keeping track of the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=216
Page 27

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   time, but we were certainly keeping track of what

3   are the various matters that we are working on.

A                 Q.   And is anyone, during the time period

5   when you were at WRA, were any Philip Morris

6   operating companies free to call you to provide

7   services?

6                            MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

9                A.   Well, you know, the answer to that is

10   yes.  I mean WRA performs services on behalf of all

11   the operating companies, or at least most of them.

12   I mean there were clearly services being performed

13   on behalf of Kraft, clearly services on behalf of

14   PM International, PM USA.  When you say free to

15   call on us, yes, they were all free to.  The group

16   tended to focus on specific important material

17   regulatory issues.  It wasn't a group that was just IB       there to handle every regulatory issue for every

19   operating company.  The more routine ones the

20   operating companies would deal with themselves.

21        Q.         What percentage of your time would you

22   estimate you spent on non-tobacco regulatory

23   matters while at WRA?

24        A.   While at WRA.  Personally, clearly my

25   focus, the majority of my time was on tobacco

Esquire Deposition Services 1 800-944-9454pgNbr=217
Page 28 ]                                   Berlinci - Confidential

7       issues, either for PMI or  PMI is PM

3   International  or FM USA or sometimes both,  Noc

4   all of my time.  I did occasionally touch on a food

5   issue or a Kraft issue, and I wound up spending

6   some fair amount of time on what I'd call a

7   corporate issue or PM Companies issues that were

8   not tobacco company specific. -So I wouldn't -- it

9   would be very hard for me to put a percentage on,

10   but I would say the percentage was for one or more

11   of the tobacco companies within the department.

12             WRA as a whole, it's a very different

13   answer.  There were a couple people really

14   dedicated to working some food issues or what was

15   primarily a food issue, and there was another group

16   of people who were called the environmental policy

17   group, and they worked on things like waste

18   management and plastic packaging issues, just what 13       I considered to be more general environmental

20   issues, and those would have been on behalf of all

21   the operating companies.  So my personal experience

22   was not reflective overall of the department,

23   necessarily.

24        Q.    Would you estimate during the time that

25   you were at WRA you spent 90 percent of your time

Page 29

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    on tobacco issues?

3        A.   Somewhere between 8 0 and 90 is probably

4    fair.

5        Q.   You went to WRA in March of '96.  How

6    long were you in that position?

7        A.   I was assistant general counsel for,

8    well, let's say, nothing, so I don't have to do the

9   math until July or August of '97 when I became

10    senior assistant general counsel but still within

11    WRA.

12         Q.    Were you still reporting to

13   Mr. Firestone, or Mr. Whidden and then

14    Mr. Firestone;?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And did your duties change when you

17    became senior assistant general counsel?

18        A.    Yes-  The scope of it changed somewhat.

19    There had been some -- well, prior to that change,

20    which would  today I say was July or August of

21    '97, hopefully, the June 20 proposed resolution had

22    occurred.  Mr. Firestone was very involved in the

23    regulatory portions of that.  He had brought me in

24    to help him out with the regulatory portions of

25    that proposal.  So it was announced on June 20th of

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=219
Page 30

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2    '97, and then -- so it would have been shortly

3   thereafter I was asked to take the new position,

4   which basically involved a refocus in a couple of

5   different ways.

6              Number one, my duties included working

7   with the government affairs team in Washington on

8   the efforts to try to get and convince Congress to

9   implement the legislation that would have been

10   necessary to fulfill the proposed resolutions.  So

11   that was a joint effort with the state Attorneys

12   General to advocate that the legislation that was

13   necessary to effect the proposed resolution be

3 4        enacted by Congress, and only Congress could have

15       done it.  So I had that as part of my

3 6        responsibilities.

17              And I was also given some explicit

18   responsibilities for oversight of some of the

19   regional work that WRA was responsible for

20   internationally.  I was asked to oversee  and

21   there were some lawyers and we had skipped ahead,

22   so in the intervening time some more lawyers had

23   joined that were assigned to the Asian region, the 2*3        European region and the Latin American region

25       working ss   lawyers to give legal advice on

2    regulatory issues to E'M International, and I was

3   asked to supervise those attorneys and be

4    responsible for that aspect of the practice as

5   well.

b       Q.    And what was your position or

7    approximately how long were you in the position you

8    went into in July of '97?

9        A.    I was senior assistant general counsel

10    of WRA until August of 2 000.

11         Q.    During that entire time did you report

12    to Mr. Whidden  through Mr. Whidden to

13    Mr. Firestone?

1A                   A.   No.  That changed at the end of '97.

15    Mr. Firestone went to  he left WRA and went over

16    to PM International to take a job in the legal

17    department of that company.  So he relocated to

18    Switzerland.  And Denise Keane was brought in as

19    the head of WRA, senior vice president associate

20    general counsel and in charge of WRA.  I don't

21    remember the exact title.  So she  took over for

22    Mark, and she then reorganized the department a

2 3        bit.  She brought in some more people with her, and

24    as part of the reorganization I then was reporting

25    directly to Denise.  Roger Whidden was still in the

Page 32

1                  Berlino. - Confidential

2   department, but I was reporting to Denise in early

3    '98.

4         Q.   And had Ms. Keane been working in the

5   WRA department prior to becoming its head?

6        A.    No.  She was in the legal department.

7    In fact, she was the general counsel of Philip

8   Morris USA prior to that time, and many positions

9   prior to that, which I'm not really farailiar with.

10        Q.   What changed in August of 2000 

11               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

12         Q.     with respect to your  either your

13    job title  with respect to your job

14    responsibilities?

15        A.   In August of 2000, I took a job that was

16   not in WRA.  It was elsewhere in the legal

17    department.  There was  it was, and I say a small

18    group of lawyers that is referred to as corporate

19   affairs legal, headed up by a gentleman named Al

20    Carney, and so I took a job as associate general

21    counsel Philip Morris Management Corp., reporting

22    in to Mr. Carney, working for the corporate affairs

23    legal group.

24         Q.    Does WRA still exist?

25        A.    Today, it does not, no.

2:       Q.   Do you know when it ceased to exist?

3        A.    Yes-  I can't pinpoint an exact date for

4    you, but it was later that year.  It was by the

5   end --  it was late in 2000 that it was dissolved.

6        Q-   When you took the job with corporate

7   affairs legal, did you know that WRA was a S        department that was going to be dissolved? 9        A.    No, I didn't.

10        Q.   What was the nature of your duty  is

11    your position still the same, associate general

12    counsel in the corporate affairs legal department?

13        A.    Ye s r si r.

14         Q.          So you've held that from about August of 16        2000 to the present?

16        A.    To the present.

17         Q.          And what are your current

18    responsibilities?

19        A.   Okay.  The corporate affairs legal group

20    is responsible for providing legal advice to the

21    corporate  I'll try to explain this in a way --

22    Philip Morris Companies has a senior vice president

23    in charge of corporate affairs for Philip Morris

24    Companies.  His name is Steve Parrish..  He has a

25   department that he runs which I refer to as

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538255

3990538255pgNbr=223
Page 34

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    corporate corporate affairs, which means it's

3    corporate affairs for the parent company as opposed A        to the corporate affairs departments of each

5   operating company, and each of them has one.

6   Again, like the legal department, I think that most

7    of Steve's, if not all of, most of his direct

ii        reports are in fact PMMC employees, and the vast:

9        bulk of the employees who are in corporate

10    corporate affairs are also PMMC employees.

11               But there 3re a number of corporate

12    corporate affairs departments-  They include

13    government affairs, that's federal and state.  They

14    include public affairs.  There's corporate

lb        communications.  And there's one called -- I think

16    they changed its name recently, but I think it's

17    called strategy and social responsibility.  Those IB        are each headed by somebody who reports directly to

19    Mr. Parrish.  And the job of or the function of

20    corporate affairs legal, which is now the group

21    that I'm in, is to provide legal advice and, in

22    effect, be the lawyers to those groups, that group.

23    So that's what the group does.  That's now what I

24    do.

25         Q.          What specifically are your current

2   responsibilities?

3        A.   Okay-  My primary focus right now, and I

4   think it's best described as a focus, because

5   there's a lot of general stuff that goes on from G       any of those groups, all sorts of things can come

7   up.  It ranges from the most general of legal

8   advice, you know, contracts so that they can hire

9   consultants and do computer programs and things 10       like that, to the more specialized things.  The

] 1       area of focus I have right now is on the government

12       affairs group, both federal and state.  And I am

] 3       responsible for giving them legal advice, both with

14   respect to legislative issues, meaning what I think

15   of as the content sidt*, you know, how are they

16   helping them with the advocacy that they are

17   preparing in terms of the legislative agendas that

18   the companies has, providing them with legal advicc-i

19   in terms of analyzing new legislation that's

20   proposed helping them -- I'm considered the

21   legislative counsel.  I help them draft things when

22   they are proposing things to different legislation.

23   I'm also responsible for the compliance side of 21       government affairs, which is a huge part of it. 25       When you start thinking about the lobbying laws

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538257

3990538257pgNbr=225

2   that exist and the campaign finance contribution

3   laws and the gift laws, not only at the federal

4   level but at all 50 states, there's an immense kind

5   of structure that's in place to make sure that the

6   companies and government affairs are in compliance

7   with all of those lobbying and government affairs

8   laws type requirements.  So I'm responsible for

9   that.  So there's a big government affairs focus

10   right nowr takes up a fair chunk of my time.

11             The second biggest focus after that

12   would be on corporate communications, which is

13   pretty general, but the corporate communications

11       folks communicate externally to the public and also

15   internally to employees.  And so whatever the issue

16   might be, I mean they communicate across the range

17   of issues, so I give them legal advice and support

18   with respect to all the work that they do.  I'm

19   their principal lawyer.

20             I'm also the principal in-house lawyer

21   advising a group within public affairs that is

22   called the corporate Identity group, and that is

23   the group that is running the  responsible for

24   the project that is wound up in a current proposal

25   to change the name of Philip Morris Companies, Inc.

13
	what might be a draft of something that they are

2          A.           Well, there's a kind of derivative

3    element to this.  When government affairs, let's A         say federal government affairs, as  they are nov;

b         currently doing, are putting a lot of efforts into

6    what they consider to be a very important

7    legislative objective for the company, which is

8    trying to convince Congress to enact FDA

9    legislation that would give FDA the authority to

1C1         regulate tobacco products and including all aspects

11    and the manufacturing, distribution, reduced risk

12    products, warning labels, that's a very high

13    priority for my client, government affairs.  That

14    obviously involves working very closely with their

15    client, which is PM USA, on that issue, because

16    that's the operating company that that issue would

17    most likely affect.  So there is a lot of -- maybe

18    the easiest away zo  think about it is the working

19    group concept.  We were all kind of on a team

20   working on it.  And it includes PM USA people, so I

21    will get calls from PM USA people asking me this,

22    asking me that, asking me to help them with certain 2 3         things.

24                                     But maybe the accurate, most accurate

2b         way to answer your question is to make it clear

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538260pgNbr=228
Page 39

2    that if a Philip Morris USA person asks me to do

3    something, which does occur sometimes, any

A         assistance I would give, I would only give with a

5    copy to or with the consent of their lawyers at PM

6    USA.  The people who are assigned to them from the

7    PM USA legal department are their lawyers, so I

8    would not give direct advice to a PM USA lawyer

9    unless it was sort of with the acquiescence of the 10         PM USA legal counsel.

1 ;i.       Q.   How many people are in the. corporate

12         corporate affairs legal department headed by

1.3         Mr. Carney?

14          A.   Should I exclude administrative

15    assistants, or do you want 

16         Q-    Yes.

17          A.    I'm sorry, this is not such a hard

1.8         question.  I just don't want to leave anyone out. ] 9                                    It's five full-time professionals and

20    one full-time seconded professional.

21          Q.    What does "seconded professional" mean?

22          A.   Someone who is on loan to the group from

23    one of the outside law firms to work en contracts

24    and things like that.  He's not an employee but,

25    like I said, on loan.

2         Q.   Who is the head of the corporate

3    identity group?

4         A.    His name is Jim Spector.

b                   Q.   And you mentioned another group within

6   corporate corporate affairs that was called

7    corporate strategy or corporate  was there

8    another 

9        A.    I fear that I get it wrong, so with

10    apologies to them, I think it's called -- it used

11    to be called issues management.  It's headed by a

12    man called David Nicoli, N-I-C-O-L-I, and I think

13    it's called strategy and social responsibility.

14         Q.    How many people are in that group?

15        A.   More than 10, or around 10.  I don't

16    know precisely, but I'd say around 10 or 12.

17         Q.          Who is the  can you name the five

18    professionals and one seconded professional in

19    the -- in your current group?

20         A.    Yes, I can.

21         Q-    Would you, please?

22         A.    Yes.  Al Carney, as I mentioned, is

23    the  he's vice president and associate general

24    counsel of Philip Morris Management Corp.  he heads

25    up the group.  There's myself.  There is  well,

2    this is right on the cusp of reality,  I counted

j        this one, because he has just agreed to come join

4        us.  He hasn't really started his employment, but

b        he signed the contract, so we will have a new

6    lawyer named Jim Portnoy working for me down in

7    Washington.  We have two paralegals, or legal

8    analysts I think is how they would refer to

9    themselves.  One of them is named Christy Bernard,

10    she works for me also based down in Washington.

11    The other is called  named Ejehan Turker, she

12    works directly for Al, she's based in New York.

13    And then the seconded person's name is Amir, and

14    the last name I can neither pronounce nor spell. lb                  Q.    Is Amir seconded from elsewhere in

16    Philip Morris or from some outside law firm?

17         A.    He's seconded from Hunton & Williams.

18    He's a legal analyst, too, I should mention.

19         Q.   You mentioned that a few of the people

20    work for you in Washington.  Do you work in

21   Washington?

22        A.    I am unfortunately into splitting my

2 3         time arrangement now where I'm expected to be there

24         three days a week, basically, but I consider my

2 5        base to still be up here in New York and I live in

	A.
	They were the primary participants in
	

8
	the meeting.  A couple other people from the PMMC
		

9

10
	and say

2        Q.    Did you review any documents in

3   preparation for the deposition?

4        A.    Yes, I did.

5        Q.    Did you review any documents other than

6   those shown to you by your attorneys?

7        A.    No, I didn't.

8        Q.    Can you estimate the total amount of

9   time you spent preparing for the deposition?

10        A.    I would say two and a half days, in

11   total, eight-hour days, lunch breaks, less than 20

12   hours.

13        Q.    Did you do any preparation on your own,

14   other than in the meetings?

15        A.    The only thing I did that  on my own

16   outside the meeting, just a few minutes worth.

17        Q.    What was that preparation?

1.8       A.    I read one of the documents that I was

19   given by my counsel.

20        Q.   When did you first learn you were going

21    to be deposed in this case?

22        A.    I was told about this a few months ago,

23   couple months ago.  I don't remember the exact

24    date, but there was a time in February or January

25   when I was asked to put this week aside, because

2   this was going to be a date when it was going to

3   happen  I'm sorry, did you ask me when I was

4    first told?

!>       Q.   When were you first told that you were

6   going to be deposed?

7        A.    That's an accurate answer.  I had been

8   told there was a possibility that it was going to

9   happen, but I was first told it was definitely

10   going to happen two, three months ago.

11        Q.    Other than the  other than what you

12   stated so far, did you do anything else to prepare

13   for the deposition?

14        A.    No.

15        Q.    Other than the work you did in WRA on

16   the Massachusetts legislation, have you done any

17   other litigation work at Philip Morris?

18        A.    Yes.

19        Q.    What other litigation have you worked

20   on?

21        A.    I have worked on the litigation that

22   Philip Morris USA filed in relation to the FDA

23   rulemaking.  And I worked on the litigation that

24    Philip Morris USA filed with respect, to some

25   advertising restrictions in Massachusetts.  Worked

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=235
Page 46

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    on both of those up to the Supreme Court decisions

3    in each of those cases.  I worked on the litigation A        Philip Morris USA was a plaintiff in, with respect

5    to the EPA risk assessment of secondhand smoke.

6               I'm trying to think if there's any 

7    oh, I have given some, tangential advice with

8    respect to litigation that the company is not a

9   party to but that we are providing financial

10        support for in various state referenda issues where

1 ].        committees or plaintiffs or citizens of those

12    states file a lawsuit, against a particular ballot

13    initiative, and sometimes the company would provide

14    support for that and disclose that support under

15    its policies.  And so I have provided some, I would

16    say, tangential advice with respect to that but

17    nothing very involved.

IS                                Oh, God, I'm sorry, I also worked on the

19    litigation where PM USA was a defendant, we call it

20    internally the Proposition 65 case.  It was a

21    regulatory case, kind of quasi-regulatory, but it

22    was a lawsuit brought in California against some of

23    the major tobacco companies, claiming a violation

24    of what's referred to as Proposition 65 out in

25    California.

2         Q.          Any other litigation?

3        A.   Not that I think of.

'1       Q.    Has your work in these cases involved

5   drafting legal documents?

6              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

7        A.    It's principally involved commenting

8    on legal documents that would be drafted by outside

9   counsel, but I can't say with certainty that

10    there's nothing I ever drafted as an original

11    draftsperson.  But clearly I have been involved in

12    the drafting of legal documents.

13         Q.    Have you done any work with respect to

14    corporate communications for any of these cases? lb                   A.    Can we back up a minute, because when

16    you mentioned that, I thought of one more piece of

17    litigation that I have been involved in.  And that

18    is current litigation that has been commenced with

19    respect to the proposed name change to Altria

20    Group.  There's a trademark case that I have also

21    been providing advice with respect to, so, sorry

22    about that.

23               That having been said, can you read back

24    or ask me that question, what you asked again?

25         Q.    Let me ask first, have you done any work

2    on United States versus Philip Morris?

3          A.   Other than insofar as it relates to this

4    deposition, I haven't done any work on the b         litigation defense.

6          Q.    Have you done work on other aspects --

7    have you done any other work  have you done any B         other work on the United States versus Philip

9         Morris case, other than litigation defense?

10          A.    I have provided advice and assistance to

11    federal government affairs who has been engaged in

12    activities in Washington with respect to advocating

13    different issues in Congress and with the executive

14    branch, with respect to this case.

15          Q.   Any other  can you describe the nature

16    of that work?

17          A.   Well, it varies.  I mean there's 

18    there are  there's different aspects to it.  The

19    primary area I would say involves advising and

20    assisting them with the creation of advocacy pieces

21    and arguments that are used in a political context,

22    position papers that point out things such as that 2 3         this was the only lawsuit that had been filed  24          that had been announced, civil lawsuit that had

2 5         been announced in a State of the Union address by a

2    president that the Secretary of Labor at the time

3    said that this case was regulation by litigation

4    and had been brought because the administration

5    failed to achieve its legislative goals in

6   Congress, when the McCain bill didn't pass advocacy

7    pieces that talk about, things such as the relief

8    being apparently sought in this case, the

9   injunctive relief, and how similar it: is and -- to

10    the kinds of areas that would be addressed by FDA,

11    if Congress would pass FDA legislation such as we

12    are advocating.  Issues involving the use of

13    resources that this case is consuming within the

14    justice department at a time when Attorney General

15   Ashcroft is saying that the focus of the department

16    needs to be on terrorism.  It's things of that

17    nature.  That is one area of their focus and I'd

18    say the principal kind of thing that I have been

19    engaged in.

2 0       Q.    Have you provided similar advocacy

21    documents for the other cases that you mentioned --

22    strike the question.

23               Did you provide similar advocacy 

24    strike that question.

2 5                                   Did you draft advocacy pieces similar to

Page 50

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   the ones you described with respect to the U.S.

3   versus Philip Morris for the Reilly case in

4   Massachusetts?

5        A.         Just to go back, I want to -- if I

6   testified that way, I might have misstated it, but

7   I don't think I said that I drafted all that.  I

8   said I provided advice with respect to it.

9             To answer your question in terms of

10   similar pieces for U.S. v. Reilly, I think the

11   answer would be no, because there was not really a

12   political dimension to that case as there was or as

13   at least the company believes that there is

14   involving this case.  So no -- and indeed that was lb       a case where Philip Morris USA is a plaintiff, so

16   we filed the case.  And the idea of federal 

17   government affairs activities with respect to the

18   case is obviously not about the merits of the

19   what's going on in the courtroom or in the kind of

20   cases being litigated, there are issues in Congress

21   going on all the time relating to the funding of

22   the case, relating to the question of whether the

23   case ought to be continued or ought to be dropped.

24   So there's a political dimension to this case that

25   government affairs has been involved in that was

2    absent from, I believe, every other case that I

3   mentioned.

4         Q.   Have you drafted advocacy pieces for b        U.S. versus Philip Morris?

6        A.    I have provided  I have done some

7    conceptual work.  I have given them advice with

8    respect to what kinds of arguments I thought were

9   both legally appropriate and within company policy.

10    And as part of that, I think I also from time to

11    time have provided them with drafts for their

12    consideration.  But it's not my draft.  I mean they

13    are the ones who ultimately have to decide whether

14    or not they want to use a particular piece or not.

15        Q.    Do you have the authority to preclude

16    them from using a particular piece or not?

17         A.    Well, I'm their legal counsel, so under

18    the company policy they are supposed to seek advice

19    and they are supposed to have their materials

20    reviewed to make sure they are legally appropriate 21.        and don't damage the company from a legal

22    perspective-  To me, it's always an interesting

23    question in terms of authority.  My own view of my

24    own job, I'm now speaking  I'm not purporting to 2b        quote any company policy.  I don't know what the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

2   company would exactly say, but I believe I'm there

3   to give legal advice.  The clients are the business

4   people, and to me it's ultimately their decision

5   whether they want to  you know, how they want to

6   view my advice, whether they want to follow it,

7   whether they want to ignore it.  So they are the

8   decision-makers.  I feel that my role is to give

9   them the advice.

10        Q.    You say in certain circumstances you

11   have drafted materials.

\2                            Are those along the nature in the

I'i       advocacy points, are those  would you describe

14   them as talking points or would you describe them

15   as talking points?

16        A.   No.  1 would describe them as white

17   papers.  White papers.  To me, talking points is

18   the kind of thing where, you know, you are giving

19   someone a document with a couple little bullet

20   points, and you are expecting that person to say to

21   somebody 

22             MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's go off the record. 2 3                             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 9:58.

3               THE VIDEOGRAPKER:  The time is 10:07.

4         We are back on the record.

5         Q.    Sir; with respect to the advocacy work

6    you've done with the government affairs office in

7    Washington, how large is that federal government

8    affairs office?

9         A.   The federal team probably has been a 2 0        dozen employees, and they are not maybe for

11        purposes  when you are talking in terms of this

2 2        case, they are not all tobacco.  The tobacco team

13    is probably five or six of them.

14         Q.   Who are those people?

15         A.          Well, the head of government affairs is

16    John Scruggs, and the tobacco team includes Beverly

17    McKitrick, Greg Scott, Abby Perlman, Bob Riese, IB        Kathleen Linehan.  I don't think I'm leaving

19    anybody out.  So that would be the federal tobacco

20    team.

21           Q.    Is Mr.  understanding that it's a t:eair.

22    of people working  let me ask the first question.

23    Are all the people mentioned here, have they all

24    done work relating to the United States versus

25    Philip Morris case?

	Q.    You indicated that you are in Washington

9
	three days of the work week; is that correct?

10

	hasn't happened this week, for example.  It's not

12
	hard and fast, but that's the idea.

Q.    McKitrick.

MR. FREDERICK;  Objection.

0.    -- spends on the U.S. versus Philip Morris case?

MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.  I'm sorry.

Objection.

A.    I wouldn't want to venture a percentage guess with respect to how she manages her time, but I can tell you that in the constellation of things that she's currently working on and responsible for right now, this is a pretty minor one.  It's  if you asked her, it. would be a small percentage of her time.  She's also got principal responsibility for the FDA effort, which is by far the bulk of her time at this point.

Q.    Do you receive reports on how person hours and resources are spent on the various matters on which the federal government affairs office works?

A.    No.

Q.   Do you know what the budget for the federal government affairs office is?

A.    No.

8        again state the basis for the objection,

9        please.

10              MR. FREDERICK:  I have stated the

11        basis for the objection.  The basis for the

12        objection is the question is not just

13        irrelevant to the claims and defense in this

14        action, but beyond that it impermissibly

15        invades Philip Morris' First Amendment

16        rights and is harassing for that reason.

17              And if you persist in the line of

18        questioning, I'm going to instruct the

22        prohibit it.

MR. GOLDFARB:  We are on the record outside the presence of the witness.  This is probably evident from the videotape.

I want to, for the record, restate my objection to counsel's instruction not to answer and that the comments by counsel beyond the instruction not to answer that pertain to, more generally, the line of questioning are outside the bounds of conduct entered by the court, I think it's order 136, R&R 43, report and recommendation, of the Special Master.

We object to the objection itself for the lack of response, and so we will preserve our position on that.  And I'll ask the reporter to mark the transcript, and we will proceed with our questioning.

MR. FREDERICK:  1*11 just note for the record, with respect to the alleged violation, I think it's order number 150, if I'm not mistaken.  Counsel for the United States did answer the basis for my objection; and so I was responding to his question.

MR. GOLDFARB:  My objecti.on was not for the instruction not to answer, but to the general comment about the line of: questioning and the threat to seek a protective order, should it continue.

MR. FREDERICK:  Sorry.  I'll object to the characterization as a threat, and I understand your position and we can proceed.

7                   We are back on the record.

3        Q.    In your work with the government

4    affairs office with respect to the U.S. versus

5    Philip Morris case, does Philip Morris have third

6   parties who are also assisting with the effort?

7         A.    I think it's the other way around.  I

8    mean we don't have any third parties.  There are

9    advocacy groups, conservative groups, groups who

10    believe in good government, who are very actively

11    opposed to this litigation and who have been openly

12    and actively opposed to it.  And any  my

13    understanding of the work of federal government:

14    affairs is that a lot of it is to work with groups

15    that, like ourselves, are philosophically opposed

16    to the lawsuit, and v/e may provide some assistance

17    to them in their effort which they are undertaking

18    in any event.

21               Does Philip Morris retain paid

2.2        consultants to assist its efforts on U.S. versus

23    Philip Morris?

24         A.    I don't know.  None that I'm aware of.

25         Q.   When you have engaged in meetings or

2   discussions with the federal government affairs

3   staff in Washington about this case, have there

4   been non-Philip Morris employees present?

b       DIR.       MR. FREDERICK:  I'm going to object and

6        instruct the witness not to answer, to the

7        extent that the answer may reveal  I'm

8        going to object and instruct the witness not

9        to answer on the grounds that the answer may 3 0                  tend  maybe is irrelevant, and may invade

11        the exercise of Philip Morris' First

12        Amendment rights and therefore may be

13        harassing.

14              I'll say nothing more to the witness

15        present in deference to your interpretation

16        of order number 150.  If you want to excuse

17        the witness from the room, I'll explain

18        that.

19              MR. GOLDFARB:  Can we excuse the

20        witness, please.

21              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 10:38.

22        We are going off the record.

23              MR. DUFFY:  Madam Court Reporter, can

24        you please read the question back.

MR. FREDERICK:  If I may just, you know, for clarity, whether you agree or not, the basis for the objection is that that answer, and I don't know what the answer is, okay, but if the answer discloses that, you know, Congressman X was there or somebody from the White House is there, my position is that impermissibly invades the exercise of First /Amendment rights for you to seek that information.  If the answer is Joe Dokes was there from such and such consulting firm, I don't have an objection. I just don't know what the answer is going to be.

So if you exclude members of Congress, any government officials of any sort, I don't have an objection to the question.  If the question doesn't exclude that, then I have an objection to the question.

MR. DUFFY:  Tom, do you have any authority now?

MR. FREDERICK:  I absolutely have the authority.

MR. DUFFY:  What is that?

2              MR. FREDERICK:  Pennington, whole line

3        of First Amendment authority.  This relates

4        to current activities related to this case*,

It                  and there's a line you cannot, cross and this

6        crosses the line.

7              MR. DUFFY:  You understand we have

8        allegations in the complaint with respect to

9        false statements to the public, including

10        false statements with respect to Congress

11        and false statements with respect to the

12        executive branch and judicial branch and

13        that the United States as well contends an

14         ongoing RICO violation to the present day.

15        And, therefore, it's our position that such

16        statements would not only be relevant with

17        respect to the amended complaint, in fact

18        paragraph five of the complaint so alleges,

19        there are other paragraphs that so allege.

20        So it's our position that not only is there 2 3                   relevance but that they are directly

22        contained within the amended complaint

23        that's offered.

24              MR. FREDERICK:  I understand youx

25        position.  My position is, without in any

Berlind - Confidential way suggesting there have been false statements made to any member of Congress or any person within the government under the line of Supreme Court authority under which Nor Pennington (ph) is based, false statements to Congress are not actionable. That's just irrelevant, it's not actionable conduct and it can't be introduced into evidence and we are not going to allow inquiry into it here without  you know, if you persist in the line of inquiry, seeking to elicit that information, we will move fox an emergency protective order.

MR. GOLDFARB:  Okay.  We disagree with your legal position and 

MR. FREDERICK:  Understood.

MR. GOLDFARB:    and further note that both of the instructions that you -- on which you've instructed the witness not to answer, you have identified relevancy twice 

MR. FREDERICK:  Absolutely.

MR. GOLDFARB:   as the grounds for the instruction.  And our position is that's

2        wholly improper.

3              MR. FREDERICK:  You are

4        misunderstanding my position.  Relevancy is

5        not the ground for the instruction.  It is

6        irrelevant, all rightr but it also invades

7        First Amendment rights.  That's the grounds

8        for the instruction.  It invades First

9        Amendment rights in an  impermissible

10         fashion, is therefore harassing, that's the

11         grounds for the instruction. Relevance is

12         just another grounds for objection to the

13        question.

14              MR. GOLDFARB:  Unless I ask for the

15        basis for the objection 

16              Can we go off the record.

2    MARK      MR. GOLDFARB:  If I could ask the court

3         reporter tc mark the transcript at this A                   point, and I will proceed stating an

5        objection to the instruction not to answer

6        and ask:

7         Q.    In your work with the federal government

8    affairs office on the U.S. versus Philip Morris

9   case, have there been non-Philip Morris employees

10   present, excluding government officials?

11         A.    Not that I can specifically recollect.

12         Q.    Does the federal government affairs

13    office in Washington contract with public affairs

14    or public relations organizations?

15         A.   Ever, with respect to anything, I'm not

16    sure if that department has ever signed a contract

17    with -- if you are asking about a PR firm, no.  Irrn

18    not sure if they specifically have, no.

19               MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's mark Berlind 2 0       Exhibit 2.

22         stamp 2072062322 through 2072062327, marked

23         for  identification, as of this date.)

24               MR. GOLDFARB:  I will hand that to the

25         court reporter.

1                Beilind - Confidential

2        Q.    If you'll take a look at the document

3   marked Berlind number 2 and let me know when you've

4   had a chance to take a look at it .

5              (Witness complies.)

6        A.    I have looked at it.

7        Q.    Have you seen this document before?

8        A.   Yes.

9             MR. GOLDFARB:  I'll just note for the JO       record this document is Bates number

11        2072062322 to the last four digits 2327.

12        Q.   What is this document?

13        A.    It looks to me like it's two documents.

14   There's a short, one-page document that gives some

15   very top line bullet points in opposition to the

16   filing of this lawsuit, and then there's a longer

17   white paper which gives some substantiation to

18   those points.

19             I don't think the two are connected in

20   that way.  I think they are separate pieces.  The

21   second one is a narrative kind of white paper that

22   explains some reasons why one ought to be opposed

23   to the filing of this lawsuit.  They both appear to

24   come  from the period before the suit was actually

25   filed but after President Clinton announced his

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   intention to have it filed in the State of the

3   Union address in 1999.

A                 Q.    I note that: the first page of the

5   document seems to have a photocopied tab one up in

6   the right-hand corner.  Do you see that?

7        A.    Yes.

8        Q.         Was this -- do you know whether this

9   document was part of a larger document?

10        A.    I suspect that  well, to me they

11   look  they both look like stand-alone documents,

12   but I'm also aware that documents of this nature;

13   were assembled into a kind of a binder or a

14   notebook that would have included a number of

15   different documents.

16        Q.    Did you help prepare this document?

17        A.    I don't believe I had any involvement in

18   the first, the shorter document.  I do believe that

19   I had some involvement in giving advice with

20   respect to the second document.

21             And I want to qualify that a little by

22   saying or just embroider on it or elaborate on it

23   by saying this was a time, if you recall our time 24       line before, before I was assigned to corporate

25       affairs legal, so I was not the lawyer for

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=258
Page 69

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   government affairs at that time.  I was not

3   formally assigned as their lawyer, but I had been

4   working with them on various issues as part of my

5   work with WRA.

6        Q.    Do you know for what purpose this

7   document was prepared?

8        A.   Yes.  From looking  again, when you

9   say "this document," which one are you referring 10       to?

i;i       Q.    I'm referring to Berlind Exhibit 2, for

12   what purpose was this document prepared?

13        A.   Again, just keeping in rnind that they

14   look like separate documents to me, I'll accept the

15   construct that they are all being considered the

16   same document for purposes of this discussion.

17   They appear to me to be prepared, to have been

18   prepared for -- either to persuade people that the

19   lawsuit that had been announced should not have

20   been filed or to assist people who were of that

21   view in seeking to convince others that it

22   shouldn't be filed.

23        Q.    Do you know whether this document

24   either  and reversing the construct for a minute,

25   whether either of what you've stated as being two

2   documents, do you know whether either of these two

3   documents was circulated outside of Philip Morris;?

4        A.    I believe that they both would have

5   been.

6        Q.    Do you know who prepared the one-page

7   key issue points document that ends in Bates

8   numbers 2 323?

9        A.    No, I don't.

10        Q.    Could I ask you to turn to page two of

11   the document ~- I'm sorry, page two of the longer 1.2          of the expanded document, which is Bates number

13   2325.

14        A.    Okay.

15        Q.    Can you read the first bullet point into

16   the record, please, "Smokers Are Not a Cost to the

1 7       federal Government."

18        A.    "According to the June 16thr 1999

19   Congressional Research Service report, the argument

2 0       that smokers increase government health care costs

21    {like Medicare) is not correct.  The CRS found that

22   when a complete accounting of costs is made, the

23   facts show that the federal government actually

24   saves money due to smokers with a net benefit to

25   the federal government of about $29 billion a yearr

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=260
Page 71

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2   which then increases to a total benefit of

3   approximately $35 billion a year, when existing

4   cigarette excise taxes are taken into account."

5        Q-    Have you reviewed the CRS report

6   referenced in this bullet point?

7        A.    I have read that report, or at least

8   portions of it.  I think there were parts of it

9   that were not directly relevant to this point, but

10   I have reviewed the part that this bullet point is

11   describing.

12        Q.    Do you know what costs this document, is

13   referring to, when it refers to "a complete

14   accounting of costs"?

3 5       A.    It's  the paper by the Congressional

16   Research Service that's being described here is

17   written by an economist, and it's an economic

IB       analysis; and I'm not an economist, so anything I

19   say about it is going to be a layperson's reaction

20   or understanding of it.  The costs I believe

21    include a whole range of costs that take into

22   account medical expenses of smokers as   compared to

23   medical expenses of non-smokers.  I think the

24    figures here include cigarette excise taxes and

25   what the effects are of that, and I think that

Esquire Deposition Services

1-800-944-9454pgNbr=261
Page 72

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    there is also some inclusion of other kinds of

3    costs as well.

4         Q.    What other kinds of costs are you b        referring to?

d                  A.    I think when Congressional Research,

7   when they did this research, considered the types

8    of costs that the government does not expend in

9   terms of pension costs due to the premature deaths

10    of smokers.

11         Q.   Do you knew when this document was

12    prepared?

13        A.    I can surmise from the confines of it

14    that it had to have been after the president

15    announced his intention to file the lawsuit in

16    January of '99 but before it was actually filed.

17    I'm not sure of the filing date, but it would have IB        been during that time.

19        Q.          Just for clarification, since this

20    document refers to a June 16th, 1999 congressional

21    research service report, would you --

22         A.          Indeed.

23         Q.     would that suggest to you that it was

24    prepared sometime between June 16th, 1999 and

25    September 22, 1999, when the complaint was filed in

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

2    the case?

3        A.    It would.

4         Q.   As of that period had Philip Morris

5    publicly stated its agreement that smoking causes

6    disease?

7        A.    As of that period the Philip Morris USA

8    and Philip Morris International website  well,

9    for part of that period.  The website never went up

10    until October of '99, to begin with, so I guess for

11    part of that period there was an explicit statement

12    that there was an overwhelming consensus that

13    smoking causes disease.  Prior to that time I'm not

14    aware of any specific statement on behalf of the

15    company of the nature that you described.

16        Q.   Well, even when the website was launched

17    in October of 1999, at that point had Philip Morris HI        stated its agreement that smoking causes disease?

19         A.    I think not.

20         Q.    Did the CR3 report stated hereon, which

21    Philip Morris  to which Philip Morris refers in

22    opposing the federal lawsuit, take health care

23    costs incurred by smoking-related diseases into

24    account?

25        A.    I believe it did, but I haven't reviewed

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538235

3990538295pgNbr=263

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   it in a while.  I think that was the whole

3   foundation of it, comparing the costs of

A       smoking-related diseases to other kinds of costs.

5   And I also, I further believe that CRS, in

6   preparing this report, assumed the conclusions of

7   the government, the long-held conclusions of the

8   government for 30 years prior to that, which is

9   smoking causes cancer, lung cancer, heart disease

10   and emphysema in smokers.

11        Q.    Are you aware of a report commissioned

12   by a subsidiary of Phi.lip Morris Companies that

13   examined the relative expenditures involved in 

14   by government and to government, with respect to

15   smoking, in Czechoslovakia?

1.6                             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

17        A.   I'm aware of a study that was

18   commissioned by the Czech subsidiary of Philip

19   Morris International, I believe in 2001, that

20   purported to make some kind of economic analysis of

21   the relative costs to government arising from

22   smoking.

23        Q.   Do you know what the results of that

24   study were?

2b                             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

2              MR. GOLDFARB:  Basis?

3              MR. FREDERICK:  Relevance.

4        A.    Again, not being an economist, I can

5   answer that, broadly speaking, the results of the

6   study were that the government was taking

7   insufficient revenues to cover the costs at that

8   time -- it was in the context of an excise tax

9   increase debate, and I believe that the results

10   were that the government had enough revenue to

11    cover any smoking -- any costs relating to

12   smoking-related disease without the excise tax.  I

13   should say without the proposed excise tax

14    increase.

15        Q.    Were the results of that study reported

16   in the United States?

17        A.    Reported in what sense?

18        Q.   Were the reports  were the results of

19   that study reported publicly in the media, among

20   other places, in the United States?

21        A.    Yes.

22        Q.         Was the report itself made publicly

23   available in the United States?

24              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

25        A.    I believe it was.  I believe it was

3        Q.    Were the results of the check study

4    consistent with the results of the '99

5    Congressional Research Service report.

6              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

7        A.   I'm not an -- you know, I can't give

8    you an answer in any kind of technical way.  What I

9   can say is at the policy level, very broadly

10    speaking, the results of that study in effect that

11    the government was already receiving sufficient

12    revenues to cover anything  any costs related to

13    smoking is, on a policy level, broadly speaking,

14    the same kinds of results that Congressional

15    Research found when they looked at the question in

16    1999.

3         Q.    Did Philip Morris respond to the A        public disclosure of the Czech study?

5               MR. GOLDFARB:  Strike the question.

6         Q.   Did Philip Morris respond in the United

7    States to the disclosure of the Czech study?

S       A.    There is a response that I'm aware of

9        from Philip Morris Companies, so I believe it v/as a

10   press release that would have been here in the

11    States.  I think Philip Morris International had

12    some response, I don't know if it was issued he^re

13    in the States or it would have been in the Czech

14    Republic itself.  And there was obviously a lb        response by both companies and possibly other

16    companies within the group, in response to media

17    calls.  There was a lot of media attention.

18         Q.   Were you involved at all in Philip 3 9        Morris' response?

20         A.    I would say I was tangentially involved.

21         Q.    What was the nature of your involvement?

22         A.    There were some meetings that I attended

23    and gave advice, during which I gave some advice,

24    some legal advice, and some general thinking of 2 5         people in New York in terms of how the company

2   ought to be reacting to the fact that the Czech

.3       subsidiary of Philip Morris International had gone

4   off and commissioned this report, apparently

5   without too many people knowing about it, and also

6   how to react to the ~- from a corporate

7   communications standpoint, there was a lot of media

8   attention being paid to it, so there were

9   discussions, and I did participate in some of those

10   discussions.

11        Q.    How many people were  how many

12   meetings do you think you attended on this matter?

13        A.    Fewer than five,

14        Q.   Did the same group of people attend each

15   of the meetings?

16        A.   No.  No, there were some people,

17   obviously there was some consistency, but  I

18   would say it was not the same cast of people at

19   each particular meeting.

20        Q.   Who was in charge of the meetings?

21        A.    The meetings were convened by Peggy

22   Roberts, who works in the corporate communications

23   department, Philip Morris Companies' corporate

24   communications.

25        Q.    Was she the most senior person involved

Page 79

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   in these meetings?

3        A.    No.

4        Q.   Who was the most senior person involved

5   in these meetings?

6        A.    Steve Parrish.

7        Q.   And what general thinking, advice did

8   you provide concerning how Philip Morris should

9   respond to the media inquiries about the Czech

10   study?

11             MR. FREDERICK:  Object and instruct the

12        witness not to answer, to the extent his

13        answer would disclose legal advice he

14        provided.  To the extent the witness can

15        separate out any legal advice he provided

16        from any other advice he provided, he can

17        answer.

18             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

IS                 A.    I'm trying to pinpoint specifically.

20   I mean the discussions that I recall that were of a

21   nonlegal nature, or what I would consider to be

22   such, involved kind of the basic question of what

23   kind of -- first of all, should the company  what

24   kind of statements should the company issue in

25   terms of expressing its thoughts and its feelings

2    about the issuance of the Czech report.  And then

3    that was one part of  that was the early part, so A        that was probably the initial meeting or two.

b                               Then the press statement was out.  There

6   were a couple follow-up meetings in terms of should

7    there be any follow-up actions on behalf of the

8    company or group of companies and also to see how

9    it was playing, how the situation seemed to be ID        evolving.

11               And I don't, recall any specific nonlegal

12    advice, in terms of advice that I gave; and I

13    participated in the general discussion, I mean, so

14    it's really hard for me to separate out.  I was a

15    participant in their discussions, but there was not

16    like a specific policy prescription as a piece of

17    advice that I gave them that I thought that they

18    ought to do.  I was just there really as part of

19    the group.

20         Q.   Who other -- who else do you recall

21    participating in the meetings about Philip Morris'

22    response to the Czech study other than Peggy

23    Roberts and Steve Parrish?

24         A.    I recall David Nicoli, head of strategy

25    and social responsibility.  I recall David

2   Greenberg, chief compliance officer Philip Morris

3   Companies.  I recall Ellen Merlo, head of corporate

4   affairs for PM USA.  I recall a representative of

5   PMI corporate affairs; and they may have sent

6   different ones to different meetings, but the one I

7   recall was Bobby Kaplan.  Keeping in mind that PMI

8   was located, is located in Lausanne, Switzerland,

9   but they were in the process of moving some people,

10   so there were some people at Rye Brook, so Bobby

11   was out on the Rye Brook, so he came to the

12   meetings on their behalf, or at least a couple of

13   them,

14             1 recall Jim Lindheim, who was a

If)       consultant, and that's what I recall.  That's who I

16   recall.

17        Q.    What was the nature of Mr. Lindheim's  IB       strike the question.

19             What was Mr. Lindheim's role?

20        A.    In terms 

21             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

22        A.    In terms of the Czech study?

23        Q.   Why was Mr. Lindheim at these meetings?

24             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

2b                 A.    He, Mr. Lindheim, provides general

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   communications advice to corporate corporate

3   affairs on  a wide variety of topics, so as part: of

A       the Czech study situation was a question of hov/ the

5       company felt it ought to be communicating publicly

b       about the study.  I think he was there in that

7   capacity is my impression.

8        Q.   Just so the record is clear, he's not a

9   Philip Morris employee, correct?

10        A.   Consultant, he's an outside consultant.

11        Q.   Do you recall any other people being

12   present at these meetings other than those you've

13   mentioned?

14        A.    I don't recall, specifically, but I also 10       recall that it was the kind of meeting where there

16   were people in the room, but there was also one of

17   those phone things there, so some people may have

18   dialed in.  In terms of who I can recall, that's

19   the list.

20        Q.   Was the statement issued by Philip

21   Morris Companies, Inc. ultimately a statement by

22   Jeffrey Bible?

23        A.    I'm not going to tell you that it's not,

24   but my memory of it is it was a press release from

25   the company, so  as opposed to a personal

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=272
Page K3

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    statement by him, if you are talking about what

3    statement did the company issue.  I forgot if he

4    was quoted or not in the statement.  I just don't b        recall.

(>       Q.   Do you know whether he was consulted at

7        all with respect to how Philip Morris would respond

&        to the release of the Czech study? 9       A.    I have to say that I have to  I'm not

10    aware  I didn't witness any consulting with him,

11    but T have to surmise that it was discussed with

12    him, because in addition to the press release,

13    Mr. Bible did personally send the letter relating

14    to the Czech study to Senator Feinstein in

lb        Washington, because Senator Feinstein had raised

16    the issue either on the floor of the senate or in

17    some context, so Mr. Bible did send a letter to her ] 8        and I have seen that letter.  And so on the basis

19    of that, I have to surmise that he was consulted,

20         Q.    Are you aware of other instances in 2.1        which Mr. Bible has sent letters to members of

22    Congress?

23    DIR       MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.  Instruct the

24         witness not to answer.

2             MR. FREDERICK:  I'll state an objection.

3        Q.   Are you going to follow the advice of

4   counsel?

5        A.    Yes.

6        Q.    In your work at  during your period at:

7   worldwide regulatory affairs, did -- what were B       the  strike the question.

9                            When you were at worldwide regulatory

10   affairs, what were the primary tobacco issues on

11   which you worked?

12        A.    Well, let's see, it was a long, fairly

13   long period.  But when you say tobacco issues,

14   could you just give me a little more concrete.  You

15   mean specific regulatory matters?  Do you mean just

16   the issues generally, in terms of issues that come 3 7       up in terms of smoking and health matters?

18        Q.   When you were at worldwide regulatory

19   affairs, did you work on any matters in conjunction

20   with other tobacco companies?

21        A.    Yes.

22        Q.   What were those matters?

23        A.    When I was working on the EPA lawsuit,

24   Reynolds was a co-plaintiff  is a co-plaintiff.

25   I think some of the other companies joined much

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   later-  When I was working on the FDA lawsuit, 3

3   believe all the major companies were co-plaintiffs.

4   The ingredients lawsuit and the regulatory issues b       up in Massachusetts, I believe all the  at least

6   the top four companies or top, largest companies

7   were involved.  When r was working on the proposed

8   resolution, that involved all the major companies,

9   worked with them on that. On various international 10       things that were under my supervision, from time to 1.]       time there would be joint regulatory submissions,

12   depending on the nature of it.  I would say that in

13   recent years the joint activity has subsided and

14   trickled down to almost nothing.

15             As it stands right now, Philip Morris

16   USA is alone among the big companies in advocating

3 7       FDA regulation, we are the only ones trying to make

18   that happen.  We are not as  alone, but kind of out

19   on our own, advocating fire safety or ignition

20   propensity legislation in Congress.  We are taking

21   a different approach to public place smoking issues

22   than the other companies are.  I know we are the

23   only major tobacco company at least that is

24   actively advocating and supporting the idea of a

25   WHO tobacco control t2~eaty.  Whereas on some of

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=275
Page 86

1                     Berlind - Confidential

2    those earlier litigations and regulatory matters

3    the four biggest companies here in the States were

4    advocating the same position, that is much less the

5    case today, if at all the case today.

6          Q.   In your work at WRA did you do any work

7    on environmental tobacco smoke?

8          A.   I did a lot of work on public place

9    smoking restrictions, which is obviously  which

10    are obviously regulatory initiatives takGn in

11    response to the existence of environmental tobacco

12    smoke, but I didn't do any scientific work on ETS.

13    So with that clarification, I think the answer is

14    yes.

lb                     Q.           Are you familiar with a group called the

16    Asian Region Tobacco Industry Science Team?

17          A.    Asian Region Tobacco, ARTIST.

18          Q.    ARTIST is the acronym?

19          A.    I know what it is  I know what it was.

20        Q.   What was it?

21          A.    It was a group of scientists from some

22    of the various international tobacco companies that

23    were all either located  they were located in or

24    around the Asian region somewhere.  I don't know if 2 6         they were all in Hong Kong, probably not.  Our

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=276
Page 87

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   affiliate -- PM USA has a department called

3   worldwide scientific affairs-  That department at

4   that time had one or two scientists stationed in

5   Hong Kong and/or Tokyo, I think maybe one in each

6   place.  So I think that  those scientists were

7   involved in pulling that group together so that

8   they could come together from time to time and

9   discuss different issues that were going on in

10   Asia, in terms of regulatory and issues related to

11   tobacco science.  I was aware of that group

12   starting up and the discussions about, how it v/ould

13   be  what its activities might be and what its

14   charter might be.  I'm not aware of any activities

15   it might have actually undertaken.

16        Q.    Did you participate directly in the

17   group's formation?

18        A.    No, I didn't participate in it.  At that

19   time or during whatever -- during the time I think

20   in question, part of my responsibilities at WRA was

21   to supervise the lawyer who was stationed in the

22   Asian region for WRA.  So through that oversight

23   responsibility I was made aware that this group

24   wanted to  that our scientists or PM USA

25   scientists there wanted to form that group or

2   helped form that group.  And I recall being shown

3   sort of d plan or a document that would say 

4   basically setting out here's what the group would

5   be,   here's what it would do, here's what its

6   activities would be.  And the role that I played,

7   and the person who was working for me, was to give

8   legal advice with respect to the formation of that

9   group and what its activities might appropriately 1 0       be.

1.1        Q.    And what are -- is the group extant?

12        A.   What does that mean, does it live today?

13        Q.    Does the group still exist?

14        A.   I don't know.

15             What I do know is that the gentleman who

16   I recall as being principally interested in forming \1       the group from WSA is not out in Hong Kong anymore. 1EI       He was relocated back to Richmond.

19        Q.    Who is that?

20        A.    Roger Faulk.

21        Q.   Who is the lawyer whom you were

22   supervising, who you referred to earlier?

23        A.   Mark Friedman.

24        Q.    Is Mr. Friedman still in Hong Kong?

25        A.    No, he's in Lausanne.

2        Q.    What did the group do?

3             MR. GOLDFARB: Strike the question.

4        Q.    You indicated you were involved in some

5   discussions about what the activities were that; the

6   group might undertake.  What were those activities?

7        A.    I don't know what activities, if any,

8   they actually undertook.  I recall that in terms of

9   their  the plan that they put together, that was

10   agreed they were going to go forward with, it was

11   purely going to be a scientific information sharing

12   group.  It was not going to be a group that made

13   joint statements, made any joint submissions.  It

14   was not going to be a group that sponsored any

15   independent scientific research.  It was  my

16   understanding of the group was that it was purely

17   going to be a group that would share information

18   and views and discussions about developments that

19   would arise in the scientific literature,

20   particularly developments out in Asia, that were

21   relevant: to their businesses and their activities,

22   their respective activities generally.

23        Q.    Did it focus on particular scientific

24   issues?

25        A.    I don't recall whether it did or not.

2   Again, in terms of what they actually did, I have

3   no knowledge if they did anything, if they ever

4   even met. At the idea formation stage, which was

5   when I was involved and the only time 1 was

6   involved, I don't recall if there was any specific

7   subject matter that was identified other than it

8   was scientific issues that arose relating to

9   smoking and health.

10             MR. GOLDFARB:  Berlind 3.

11              (Berlind Exhibit 3, letter from Mark 3 2       Friedman regarding ARTIST meeting, marked

13        for identification, as of this date.)

14        Q.   Let me knov; when you've had a chance to

15   look at the document.

16              (Witness resviews document.)

17        Q.   Have you had a chance? IB       A.    Yes.

19        Q.   Have you seen this document before?

20        A.    I'm an addressee, so I will accept

21    having seen it.  I don't remember seeing it, but I

22   get the gist of the document.

2 3       Q.   What is the document?

24        A.         It's the transmittal from Mark Friedman,

25   who I mentioned before, of an invoice describing

	services
	rendered at what is described as a recent
	

3
	ARTIST meeting.
		

4
	Q.
	I note it's cc'd to D. Keane; is that
	

5
	correct?
	
	

6
	A.
	Uh-hum.
	

7
	Q.
	Would that be Denise Keane?
	

8
	A.
	Yes.
	

9
	Q.
	And at this time was Ms. Keane the head
	

10
	Of WRA?
	
	

11
	A.
	Yes.
	

12
	Q-
	Does this help refresh your recollection
	

13
	about whether or not ARTIST ever convened any
		

14
	meetings:
	
	

15
	A.
	Yes, it does.
	

16
	Q-
	Do you know whether there were other
	

17
	meetings
	other than the one referenced in this
	

18
	document'
	
	

19
	A.
	No.
	

20
	Q.
	Do you know what Covington and Burling's
	

21
	role was
	in ARTIST?
	

22
	A.
	I believe that they were asked  and I
	

23
	had not recalled anything like this in the context
		

24
	of ARTIST, but under the same theory with respect
		

2 5
	to other
	industry meetings for different subjects,

2   we would have asked them to attend a meeting that

3    involved different industry participants like that

4    to  so that there would be someone there to b        insure that inappropriate matters were not

6   discussed at the meeting.

7        Q.   Can you describe further what you mean

8    by "inappropriate matters"?

9        A.   Again, not being anything specific to ID       ARTIST or what might have been going on at this

11    meeting, I would say that in general when an

12    industry group gets together, as a lawyer of the

13    company, one thing you want to be concerned about

14    is making sure they don't do anything like discuss lb        competitive issues.  That's a prime example.

16         Q.   Was it your testimony a moment ago, just

17    so I understand it, that  strike the question.

18               Did Philip Morris pay Covington and

19    Burling*s fees in connection with its work on

20   ARTIST?

21               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

22        A.   What I gather, what I'm gathering from

23    this memo as I sit here, and reading it, is WRA

24    agreed to pay a particular invoice for a particular

25    service which isn't indicated here.  So what Mark

3990538314pgNbr=282

2   Friedman is doing is raising the question of

3   basically saying, hey, we said we would pay for

4   this once, you know, I don't know if we intended to

5   say that we would pay for it on an ongoing basis.

6             So I mean this is a kind of intercompany

7   budgeting discussion you are witnessing here.  What

8   Friedman is suggesting or raising the issue of is

9   should it be WRA  should this come out of WRA's

10   budget or, since the services are being rendered to

11   WSA, worldwide scientists affairs, should it be

12   something that they pay for.

13        Q.   Do you know whether any of the other

14   participants in ARTIST contributed to paying

15   Covington and Burling's fees in connection with

16   ARTIST  with its work on ARTIST?

17        A.    I don't, and for that I would have to

18   see the invoice, because sometimes in a law firm

19   acting as Covington is acting on behalf of more

20   than one company, sometimes what they will do is

21   send an invoice and split it up among the various

22   companies, or sometimes they will send different

23   invoices to different companies.  So the answer is

24   I don't know.

2b        Q.    Are you aware of any  strike that

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=283
Page 94 3                                Berlind - Confidential

2       question.

3               Do you know what other tobacco companies

4    participated in ARTIST?

5        A.    No, I can't give you anything that would

6   resemble a complete list.  I do have a recollection

7    that Japan Tobacco would have been one such

8    company.

9         Q.   Do you know whether any other American

10    tobacco companies participated?

11         A.   Again, I don't know definitively, but I

12    can tell you that, and this was in the days before ]'3        Reynolds sold its international operations to Japan 14        Tobacco, so my belief is that Reynolds had folks

3 5        out in Asia, and then there are all the other

It        companies as well, so --

17         Q.   Sorry, do you know  scrry, I didn't:

18   mean to interrupt.

19        A.    so it could be any number of

20    companies.  It's a question of who was out there

21    and who felt like participating.

22         Q.    Do you know whether any of the entities

23    under the umbrella of the British American tobacco

24    conglomerate participated?

25         A.    I don't know.  It's certainly possible

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=284
Page 95

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   that they would.  They have business out there,

3        Q.   Was there a standard arrangement when

4   multiple companies retained counsel, such as

b       Covington in this instance, for how the fees would

6   be allocated among the participants?

7             MR. FREDERICK;  Objection.

8        A.    I'm not -- no, I'm not aware of a

9   standard arrangement.  And indeed I would say that

10   it was not standard in the sense that it would be

11   determined on a matter-by-matter basis.  I think it

12   really depended on the circumstances.

13        Q.    I think you indicated that there  that

14   there were other instances in which Covington was

15   retained in connection with joint industry

16   activity; is that correct?

17        A.   Yes, that is.

3 8       Q.         What other instances were you referring

1.9       to?

20        A.   Well, the one that I can recall with the

21   most direct personal knowledge was the

22   Massachusetts ingredients case where Covington and

23   Burling acted, in effect, as counsel to all of the

24   plaintiffs and were the firm that, where they were

25   the shop where most of the brief writing was done,

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=285
Page 96

1                     Berlind - Confidential

2    and a lot of the work.  And so I recall getting

3    bills and reviewing bills from Covington for that A         work.  That was divided up among the companies,

5    where they would have the whole bill and they would

6    have a line for here's the PM USA share or PMMC

7    share, so that's what I was referring to when I

8    alluded to that before.

9                 I wouldn't be surprised if there were

10    other instances of that kind of billing

11    arrangement, but I would say, number one, I can't

12    recall any specific ones other than the

13    Massachusetts ingredients was one.  This ARTIST

14    appears to be  it's very unclear to rae whether we

15    are just paying our share or we are paying for ail 3 6         oi it.  And I can  tell you that this is 1998, this

17    memo.  As we get intc late '98 and certainly past

18    the MSA date of late '98, I think that kind of

19    billing and that kind of joint representation

20   diminished rapidly and substantially.

21          Q.           Are there  are you aware in your v/ork

22    with worldwide regulatory affairs internationally

23    of Covington or another law firm being retained to

24    participate or I guess to participate in joint 2 5         industry groups?

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=286
Page 97 1.                                              Berlind - Confidential

2        A.    There's one example of that that I

3    recall specifically.  And that is, at one time

A          there was a kind of standing industry group, mixed

5    group, it was not all scientists, but it was

6    scientists and people involved in regulatory

7    issues, that was a tobacco ingredients group that

8    met periodically, once a year or twice a year,

9    maybe, at most, to discuss regulatory ingredients

10    issues or regulatory issues relating to cigarette

11     ingredients.  And there was, I recall there was

12    always a lawyer from Covington and Burling there

13    who I believe it was acting not just on behalf of

14    one company or another but was really just acting lft         on behalf of the group.  And that arose from the

16    fact that in the States at least, in the U.S., the

17    industry for a long time and to some extent a~

18    least up to today had this process of submitting

19    joint industry lists of ingredients to the

20   department of HHS, Health and Human Services

21    Department.  And I think the statute -- the Federal.

22   Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, is the full

23   name -- the statute specifically contemplates

24    companies getting together to submit a joint

25   ingredients list so that confidentiality could be

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538319pgNbr=287
Page 98

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    preserved and they could do it in a rational way.

3   So Covington and Burling served as the firm that

4    the U.S. companies retained as their agent to put !:)        these lists together.

6              And keep in mind that part of the need

7    for that agent was to keep everybody's list secret

8    from each other, because these are very competitive

9   companies and they guarded their ingredients and

10    continue to guard their ingredients lists from each

11    other.  So Covington would be the neutral third

12    party that would put the list together, and I

13   believe it's from that role that they played that

14    they acquired some expertise on regulatory

15    ingredient matters and were therefore represented

16    at these ingredients groups or present at these

17    ingredients groups.

18         Q.    Just offhand, do you know what

19   percentage of the Massachusetts legal fees of

20   Covington Philip Morris paid?

21         A.   I don't.  I don't.

22               I can tell you that the parameters of

23   those kinds of discussion that I recall, and it's

24    not specific to ingredients necessarily, but you

25    could look at it one way which is four companies,

Esquire Deposition Services 1.-800-944-9454pgNbr=288
I'agc 99

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   everyone pays 25 percent.  I think it's fair to say

3   that was the preferred PM USA way of looking at it. A       Then there was the way of looking at it that says

5   divide the bills by market share, and I don't think

6   PM USA was as favorable to that way of dividing up

7   the bills.

8             MR. GOLDFARB:  I would just note for the

9        record that the Bates number on Berlind 3,

10        there are two Bates numbers listed.  I will

11        read the higher one, it's 202868019.

12        Q.         Was there any other  other than

13   ARTIST, were there other  strike the question.

14              Do you know whether ARTIST had a

15   substantive focus 

16             MR. FREDERICK: Objection.

17        Q.     with  I'll rephrase.

18             Do you know whether ARTIST had a

15       substantive focus on particular tobacco issues?

20        A.    No.  As I said, I really don't know what

21   they did.  Until you showed me this Exhibit 3, I

22   wasn't even, you know, sure- whether they had

23   actually met; and I don't know what, if any, focus

24   they may have had substantively.

25             MR. GOLDFARB:  Let me hand the court

2    Bates -- last four digits of the Bates number being

3    2678.

4        A.    Yes.

b                     Q.           And this document is a facsimile from

6    Dr. Roger Faulk, if I pronounce it correctly 

7          A.    Uh-hum.

8          Q.    to a i. Ohkawa.

9                 Do you knov; who Dr. Ohkawa is?

10          A.    T see, according to the fax cover sheet,

11    he's the senior vice president of science and

12    global environmental  environment planning group,

13    Japan Tobacco.

14          Q.    Other than by this document, have you

15    seen Dr. Ohkawa mentioned in Philip Morris

16    documents before?

17          A.    I don't recall any mention of documents.

18    I have heard Dr. Ohkawa discussed.  He's a rather

19    senior scientist or scientific person at JPT, and 1

20   have heard his name mentioned many times, but I

21    don't recall any other  you know, I'm not saying

22   there's no other documents, I'm just saying I don't: 2 3         know.

24          Q.   And this facsimile purports to be

25   communicating from Dr. Faulk to Dr. Ohkawa some

2
	documents/ including congressional testimony of

3
	Jeffrey Bible, do you see that?

A
	A.    Yes.

5
	Q.    And the  one of the short paragraphs

6
	in this -- in the cover notes read, and I quote,

7
	"As the proposed U.S. cigarette law moves forward,

8
	we need to discuss our joint activities in the

9
	context of ARTIST and the JT/PM consultant

10
	program."

n
	Do you see that sentence?

12
	A.    Yes.

3 3
	Q.    You provided a little bit of testimony

14
	earlier about ARTIST.  What does the "JT/PM

15
	consultant program" refer to?

16
	MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

17
	A.    I can't tell you definitively, because

18
	I don't have any recollection of this specific

19
	term.  I can give you my speculation, and maybe

2 0
	it's informed speculation, about what he's

21
	referring to.

22
	What I think Roger is referring to is

23
	activity whereby Philip Morris Asia and JT would

24
	hire scientific consultants.  Until I saw this, I,

25
	you know, I don't know if it's been clear to me

2    that  well, okay, doesn't surprise me that they

3    would jointly hire them, and they would then advise A         the companies on scientific issues.

5          Q.    To your knowledge, were there particular

6    scientific issues for which Japan Tobacco and

7    Philip Morris would jointly hire consultants?

8          A.    If I'm thinking of the right, thing,

9    consultants might have been giving them advice on

10    things like secondhand smoke or ETS.

11          Q.    Do you know why Dr. Faulk would be

12    sending the congressional testimony of Mr. Bible to

13    Dr. Ohkawa?

14          A.    Yes.  There's a pretty  or at least

lb         there was, I'm not sure how it stands today, but at

16    this time, again, before Japan Tobacco acquired the

17    Reynolds business overseas, there was a fairly

18    close business relationship between JT and PM

19    International.  In fact, in Japan, Japan Tobacco i s;

20    the licensee that makes all the Marlboro cigarettes

21    for Philip Morris International, so they are

22    business partners in Japan.

2 3                                   And the folks over at Japan Tobacco wero

24    always very interested and very fascinated in

25    regulatory developments that were going on here in

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=294
Page 105

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   the United States.  You can imagine, as you might

3   imagine, Japan is much different culturally, and

4   for a long time they did not have any of the kinds !">       of controversies relating to smoking and health or

6   smoking regulation that were present in this

7   country.  And so they had a very strong interest in

8   it.  I experienced some of that myself, because

9   Japan Tobacco had an, or has, a New York office

10   where they have some of their executives, and

11   whenever something would happen in the newspaper

12   relating to a tobacco issue they would call us up

13   and just ask us to provide them with information as

14   to what was going on, and we were always very happy lb       to get anything that we could send them.  So Roger

16   Faulk wanted to keep this, at this time the

17   proposed resolution was a gigantic external, event

18   that was going on, that I also recall from my own

19   experience Japan Tobacco executives were having a 2C       hard time understanding why the industry had agreed

21   to this, why the industry had agreed to that here

22   in the United States.  They were very curious about

23   it.  So Roger Faulk wanted to send -- or sending

24   these public transcripts or statements over to

25   Dr. Ohkawa would fit right with that.

2
	Q.   Turning to the preceding page on the
	

3
	fax, ending in Bates 2677, is a reply fax fro^n
	

4
	Dr. Ohkawa to Dr. Faulk; is that correct?
	

5
	A.   Yes.
	

6
	Q.   Can you read the second sentence under
	

7
	the "Dear Roger"?
	

8
	A.    "My personal opinion regarding the
	

9
	statement is that it seems problematic for industry
	

10
	in a sense."
	

11
	Q.    And the statement, the word "statement"
	

12
	in that sentence presumably refers to the Jeffrey
	

13
	Bible testimony that had been transmitted the day
	

14
	before.
	

15
	MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.
	

16
	Q.   Would that be a fair presumption?
	

n
	MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.
	

18
	A.   Well, I believe, reading this material
	

19
	here today, that on the original fax from
	

20
	Dr. Faulk, he says these documents include several
	

21
	statements regarding smoking and health.  So yes, 1
	

22
	suppose he's referring to the written statements.
	

23
	Q.    Do you know what he was referring to
	

24
	when he indicated that it was  that the
	

25
	statement, quote, seems problematic for industry in

2   a sense, unquote?

3        A.    I believe I do, but to give a fair

4   answer to that I have to step back.

T>                              I'm pretty familiar with the

6   congressional statements that were submitted by

7   Mr. Bible and the testimony that he gave during

8   this period, and I think that probably both the

9   written statements and perhaps the live testimony

10   included a resuscitation of the statement of

11   position on smoking and health condition causation

12   and ETS that Philip Morris Companies issued on

13   October 2, 1997.  So although I can't be sure, I

14   believe that that's what Dr. Ohkawa would be

15   referring to here.  And why he considers it to be

16   problematic, I have no idea.  But why Dr. Ellis

17   said she hit the ceiling when finding out about

18   this, I think I have a very good idea of what

19   that's about.

20        Q.   And what is that about?

21             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.  Instruct the

22        witness not to answer, to the extent the

23        communication with Dr. Ellis may have been 2A                 for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. 25                             If the witness understands it to be

2        otherwise, the witness may answer.

3             MR. GOLDFARB:  Objection.

<\                 A.   There was a legal advice component t:o

[>       discussions that I believe Denise and possibly

6   myself, but if 1 wasn't involved I at least knew

7   about.  The discussions were involved in, in terms

8   of industry, you know, how to deal with the rest of

9   the industry in the wake of our companies having

10   issued that statement.  On the nonlegal side I

11   recall very explicit discussions, including with

12   Dr. Ellis, to the effect that our policy was our

13   policy, and it makes no difference at all what

14   everyone else in the industry, what any other

15   company thinks, what any other company may say and

16   that there really was no point, from a policy

17   perspective, in even getting into these questions

18   with any of our competitors.

19             MR. GOLDFARB:  Objection.

2 0       0.    Can you clarify what your testimony

21   was about why Cathy Ellis said she hit the ceiling

22   on this one? That's a quote from the document.

23             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

24        A.    I believe that when she wrote she hit

25   the ceiling, it was in the context of discussions

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=298
Page 109

1                    Berlind - Confidential

2    that had gone on that, to the effect that, our

3    policy as  announced in the statement of position I

4    referred to on October 1997, which included a

5    statement that on the issues of primary smoking

6    causation and addiction, we were going to stop

7    publicly debating those issues, we were going to

8    support a single public health message and that we

9    were going to defer to the government on the text

10    of health warnings.  There were discussions that 

11    in terms of policy, there were all sorts of

12    discussions, but from a policy perspective, in

13    terms of practical application, that meant that if

14    an industry  if there was an industry effort to

15    jointly respond to a regulatory proposal in this

16    country or any other country, that that meant that

17    we were going to follow our policy even if the

18    industry and the other companies didn't necessarily

19    subscribe to that policy.  If they weren't going to

20    follow that policy, too, we were not going to

21    participate.

22          Q.   Participate, what are you referring to 2 3         when you say 

24          A.    Participate in any kind of joint

25    submission, we were not going to participate in any

Berlind - Confidential kind of joint submission that either failed to defer to the government in terms of the text of health warnings or publicly debated smoking and health issues in a way that would contravene the commitment that our companies made in what we will -- if we talk about them, what I'll refer to as the Hatch statement.

Q.         The Hatch statement is the October 2 of

6        EXAMINATION BY   (Cont'd.)

7         MR.   GOLDFARB:

8             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 1:45, we

9        are back on the record.

10             MR. GOLDFARB:  This is a continuation

11        of deposition and, by agreement of the

1.7        parties, this morning's questioning consumed

13        two hours and 51 minutes of testimony.

14        Q.    Mr. Berlind, did you work on the

15   legislation known as the McCain bill in 1998?

lb       A.    I provided advice to government affairs

17   with respect to that piece of legislation, yes.

18        0_.   What was that legislation?

19        A.   The McCain bill was  it's named after

20   Senator John McCain, so it's obviously in the

21   Senate.  It was a comprehensive tobacco policy bill

22   that was  arose out of the discussions of --

23   around the proposed resolution.  But the bill

24   itself, although at one time in its earlier stages

25   had certain similarities to the proposal that the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=301
Page 112

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   Attorneys General and the industry had made and

3   were hoping that Congress would implement, it kind

4   of was grounded in that to some degree.  But by the

5   time the legislation got enacted, it bore very

6   little similarity to the compromises and to the

7   negotiated settlement that the proposed resolution

8   represented.  So it was based upon, but in no way

9   similar to, the proposed resolution.

10        Q.   Okay.  And just so the record is clear,

11   what's the proposed resolution you are talking

12   about?

13        A.   Okay.  I may have mentioned it earlier

14   this morning, I forger.  But the proposed

15   resolution is an agreement made between state

16   Attorneys General and the largest cigarette

17   companies, along with participation by

18   representatives of the public health community,

19   that was negotiated throughout the spring of '97

20   and was signed on June 20th, '97.  And what the

21   proposed resolution really was  physically was a

22   contract or an agreement among the parties to seek

23   federal legislation, to go and jointly advocate to

24   Congress that if Congress passed legislation along

25   a series of defined principles relating, among

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=302
Page 113

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   other things, to FDA regulation of cigarettes and

3   certain civil liability reforms and mechanisms that

4   would have affected different litigation that was b       then in progress.

6        Q.   Just briefly, what are the major ways in

7   which the McCain bill differed from the proposed

8   resolution?

9        A.   Well, it differed in every conceivable 10       way.  I'll try to illustrate some of the

] 1       highlights.

12             The FDA provisions of the bill, it was

13   supposed to be a  the proposed resolution

14   provided for regulation of cigarettes that would

15   also be based on medical device regulation, but

16   would have provisions written in to make sure that

17   tobacco products were not banned, for example, and

18   that tobacco products would not be banned through

19   the back door, through the perform and standard

20   authority.  Those provisions were not in the McCain

21   bill.  It was just pure unfettered FDA regulation,

22   without any of the particular elements that the

23   parties had negotiated as part of the proposed

24   resolution.

2b                            On the subject of payments, okay, the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=303
Page 114

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    proposed resolution did not call for any tax

3    increase on cigarettes.  The McCain bill included

4    the largest single tax increase ever proposed by

5    the federal government.  It was something like

6    that, $500 billion in new taxes, anyway, it was a

7    dollar fifteen a pack over a certain period cf

8    years, it was an awful lot of money, billions of

9   dollars in new taxes that were called for by the

10    proposed resolution.

11               In terms of civil liability reform, the 22        proposed resolution provided that the state AG,

13    state Attorneys General, cases were to have been

14    settled, class actions were to have been

15    legislatively settled.  Punitive damages, at least

16    to some degree, were to have been legislatively

17    settled in exchange for a payment of $60 billion.

18    None of those elements were present in the McCain

19   bill.  The McCain bill had ultimately almost

20    nothing in the way of civil liability reforms in

21    exchange for the payment and the First Amendment

22    concessions that the tobacco companies had

23    negotiated.

24               So those are some examples, but I'm sure

25   by no means all.

2        Q.    Did both of the  both the proposed

3   resolution and the McCain bill include marketing

4    and advertising restrictions?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   What were the  strike the question.

7               Were there advertising and marketing

8    restrictions coininon to both the proposed resolution .9       and the McCain bill?

10         A.    Yes.

11         Q.   What were those?

12        A.    I'll tell you some that I can remember.

13    There was  let's see, there was a requirement

14    under both the proposed resolution and under the

15   McCain bill that every cigarette pack be labeled as

16   a nicotine delivery device.  There was  a

17    requirement under both bills relating to

18    billboards, tobacco billboards.  There was a

19    requirement under both relating to the giveaways; of

20    items such as caps and T-shirts that have cigarette

21   brand imagery on them.  There was, I believe in 22.       both, a provision relating to cigarette sampling.

23   There was in both a provision relating to

24    sponsorship of events by cigarette companies.

25              And as I go through each one of these or

2   as  I name each one in particular, I'm not  I

3   can't guarantee you or say specifically that they

4   were precisely the same language in each one, but 5>       my recollection is they were relatively similar.

6   So those are some examples.  There are probably

7   others.  I know there are others.

8          Q.            Did both the proposed resolution and the

9   McCain bill include provisions including point of

10   sale advertising?

11        A.    The proposed resolution did have point

12   of sale provisions, and I believe that such

3 3       provisions were in the McCain bill, I believe they

14       were.

l!j       Q.    Did both the proposed resolution and the

16   McCain bill have provisions concerning signage in

17   retail establishments?

18        A.   That's what I was referring to when I

19   just mentioned point of sale.  That, to me, is the

20   retail signage requirements.

21        Q.    Did both the proposed resolution and the

22   McCain bill have restrictions on the sale of

23   cigarettes through vending machines?

24        A.    I know the proposed resolution did.  It

25   had a restriction on vending machine sales,  maybe

2   even a ban on vending machine sales.  So I presume

3   it was in the McCain bill, but I can't tell you for A        sure.

5        Q.    What was the purpose of all these

6   provisions.

7             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

8        A.   The purpose from what perspective?

9          Q.            Did Philip Morris agree with the

;] 0         provisions on marketing and advertising in the

11   proposed resolution?

12             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

13        A.    Philip Morris USA accepted those

14   provisions.  The Attorneys General who were

15   negotiating the settlement wanted those

16   restrictions to be put into place, and so Philip

17   Morris USA accepted them in connection with the

18   overall package, if you will, of provisions that

19   were negotiated as  part of the proposed resolution.

20  . They also accepted them as a way of addressing a

21   subject of clearly significant numbers, percentages

22   of people in the public were concerned about.

23   There had been a lot of attention paid to cigarette

24   advertising.  Philip Morris USA concluded that

25   whatever the merits of the attention that was oaid

Esquire Deposition Services J-800-944-9454pgNbr=307
Page 118

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    to the subject, it was important for the company to

3    proactively work on efforts and try to work

4    constructively with the government on efforts to

5    take action that would make progress towards

6   solving a problem that people, numbers of people

7   considered to have existed at the time.

8         Q.    What was the problem 

9        A.    There was 

10        Q.     to which you are referring?

11         A.    There was a lot of attention being paid

12    to cigarette marketing, and there was in particular

13   allegations that cigarettes were being marketed to

14    kids.

15        Q.    Did Philip Morris  strike the

16    question.

17               Were there other provisions proposed by

18    the state Attorneys General on advertising and

19   marketing restrictions that were excluded from the

20    proposed resolution?

21               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

22        A.    None that I'm aware of, but I have to

23    qualify that answer by telling you I was not fully

24    involved with the discussions that took place, and

25    there were plenty of discussions that took place

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=308
Page 119

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   that I did not witness.  I was involved in sortie but

3   not all of them.  So the answer has to be limited

4   in that respect.

5        Q.    Did Philip Morris consider the

6   provisions you identified to be effective measures

7   to address the problem of -- the problem that you

8   articulated?

9        A.    Philip Morris USA did not and does not

10   believe that cigarette advertising is what causes

11   minors to smoke.  So the position of Philip Morris

12   was not that those restrictions that were in the

13   proposed resolution were, from its own point of I'd        view, going to be the thing that would most

1.5       effectively or have any affect on solving the

16   problem.

17             However, another objective of the

18   company, as I said, in addition to arriving at a

19   negotiated settlement, was in effect to try to meet.

20   people halfway on their concerns and to try to make

21   progress.  And there were a lot of people, both in

22   the public health community and outside Lhe public

23   health community, who consider cigarette

24   advertising to be a factor.  So Philip Morris USA

25   agreed that in order to help address those people's

Esquire Deposition Services

1-800-944-9454pgNbr=309
Page 120

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    concerns, curtailing the advertising practices in

3   those ways was an appropriate thing for it to do.

4         Q.    Did Philip Morris support the McCain

5   bill as it was originally introduced?

6              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

7        A.   My recollection is that even as

8    initially introduced, the McCain bill did not bear

9    enough of a similarity to the proposed resolution 10        for either Philip Morris USA or any of the other

:i 1        cigarette companies that were involved to endorse

12    it as such  as an accurate legislative embodiment

13    of the proposed resolution.  It gets kind of

14    relative, though, because the McCain bill, as it

15    went through the committee and as it went onto the

16    Senate floor, continued to get more and more

17    dissimilar from the proposed resolution, from the IB        tobacco companies' point of view.  So it got less

19    and less favorable from their perspective.  But I

20    think even as it was initially introduced into the

21    commerce committee, it probably was not close

22    enough.

23         Q.    You indicated earlier that you had been

24    involved in Philip Morris* advocacy efforts and in 2b        some cases drafting materials in connection with

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=310

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   the U.S. versus Philip Morris case.

3             Were you also involved in the same types A       of activities in the McCain bill?

5        A.    Yes, in the same kind of way, both

6   providing legal advice with respect to what the

7   materials should be saying and should not be saying

8   and also assisting with the creation of some of the

9   materials.  And also reviewing materials that were

10   created by others.

11        Q.   Did Philip Morris, in the instance of

12   the McCain bill, work in conjunction with third

13   parties?

14             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

15        A.    Philip Morris took the same position

16   on the McCain bill that the other cigarette

17   companies did, so certainly in that sense we were IB       working with others.

19        Q.    Did Philip Morris solicit support from

20   other third parties to oppose the McCain bill?

21             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

22        A.   If by  I'll answer in the sense of

23   third parties meaning groups, activist groups,

24   foundations, citizen groups, yes.  The company

25   sought, you know, as many allies as they could

2    possibly find.

3          Q.   Who led that effort for Philip Morris?

4          A.   By the "effort," would you be more

5    specific?

6          Q.    The effort to oppose the McCain 1         legislation.

8                 MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

9          A.    Generally speaking, I think the right

10    thing to say is that Steve Parrish was in charge of

11     corporate affairs at the time, and he reported in

12    to Murray Bring, who was both the general counsel

13    and in charge of -- he also had corporate affairs

14    organization under his umbrella.  So the ultimate 3 5         person responsible for the effort both in support

16    of the proposed resolution and advocating that

17    Congress enact that proposal and the advocacy in

18    opposition to the. McCain bill would have been led

19    in that sense by Mr. Bring, but he was not the

20    day-to-day operations, you know, operational person

21    in Washington.

22          Q.    Who was the day-to-day operations person

23    in Washington?

2 4       A.    The then head of government affairs for

2 5         Philip Morris Companies was Howard Liebengood, and

	he would have reported in to Mr. Parrish.
	

3
	Q.    Is Mr. Liebengood still with the
	

4 b
	company?
 A.    No.
	

6
	Q.    Do you know when he left?
	

7
	A.    Not precisely, but I believe it would
	

8
	have been sometime in 1998, possibly 1999.
	

9
	Q.    Do you know where he went?
	

ID
	A.    No.
	

11
	Q.    Did  strike the question.
	

12
	How many people in the federal
	

13
	government affairs office were involved in handling
	

14
	Philip Morris' opposition to the McCain
	

15
	legislation?
	

16
	MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.
	

17
	A.   I don't know.  Didn't pay a lot of
	

18
	attention to it, and they were not my direct
	

19
	clients at that time.
	

20
	Q.    "At that time" meaning, I guess, in the
	

21
	period summer and fall of '98?
	

22
	A.    Yes, okay.  Good.
	

23
	Q.    Were you working on McCain -- did you
	

24
	have McCain bill related responsibilities?

A.    Yes, I did.

Q.   What percentage of your time during that period were you spending on matters related to the McCain bill?

MR, FREDERICK:  Objection,

A.    If we are talking about the period during which the McCain bill was alive, from its introduction to its defeat on the floor of the Senate, I was working on it the majority of my time.

Q.    Did Philip Morris employ PR firms cr lobbying firms, in connection with its efforts on the McCain bill?

MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

A.    Yes.

Q.   Who were they?

MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

A.    The tobacco companies jointly, if I'm recalling this correctly, hired a public relations firm called Bozell, Sawyer & Miller, and they were in effect the PR  they took the lead on the public relations side of it from the industry's perspective.  So Philip Morris USA would have been part of that engagement.

2               You asked about lobbying firms.  I can

3    tell you I know for sure that Philip Morris engaged

4    lobbying firms, and I just don't know who they are. !i       And I didn't deal with the contract lobbyists

6   directly, I just dealt with people who were the

7    internal employees.  I do know one lobbying firm,

8   again, like everyone in the industry  like the

9    four companies hired Bozell, Sawyer & Miller on ]Q        public relations, they also had jointly hired

i:i        Verner Lipfert, I believe in a lobbying connection.

12         Q.    Verner Lipfert is the law firm?

13         A.   They are a lav/ firm, but they weren't.

14    really -- they are also lobbyists, they are

] 5        registered lobbyists in Washington.  And I believe

16    they were, and my experience was they were really

17    hired in a lobbying capacity.

18         Q.   Were there  other than the marketing

19    and advertisement  advertising restrictions that

20   you identified that you believe were common to the

21    proposed resolution and the McCain bill, were there

22    additional marketing and advertising restrictions

23    in the McCain bill that were not in the proposed

24    resolution?

25                    A.          Yes,   yes.

Esquire Deposition Services 1 800-944-9454

3990538347pgNbr=315
Page 126

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2         Q.   What were those?

3         A.    I could tell you exhaustively, if 1 had

4    the McCain bill here, but the one that I remember

5   as an example was that the McCain bill would have

6    required all cigarette packs to be black and white,

7    generic black and white packs, no color on the

8    packs.  That was not part of the proposed

9    resolution.

10               I am thinking that there were others,

11    other examples like that.  I just can't recall what

12    they are -- what they were.

13         Q.   Do you know whether there were

14    restrictions that would have required that

15    advertising be text only in certain locations?

16        A.    Yes.  I think that: was part of both the

17    proposed resolution and the McCain bill.

18         Q.    What was the provision in the -- I'm

19    sorry, by "text only," I'm referring to the

20    so-called tombstone format which is black writing

21    on a white background.  You understand --

22         A.    Yes.

23         Q.     the phrase to mean the same.

24               There was a provision in the proposed

25    resolution that would have required tombstone

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=316
Page 127 L                                             Berlind - Confidential

2    format advertising in certain circumstances, was

3    that your testimony?

4          A.    I believe so, yes.  I know there w;as --

5    it helps to understand this to, of course, know

6    that a lot of what was in the proposed resolution 1         came out of the FDA rule that the Clinton

8    administration proposed and at that time was in

9    litigation.  I know that the proposed resolution

10    had a requirement, as did the FDA rule, that

11    advertisement/ advertisements be limited generally 1.2         to tombstone format, unless they were in specified 13         locations and adult only facilities.  So it applied 1.4         in a number of different ways.

15                 I'm having trouble specifically

16    recalling how that translated into the McCain bill,

17    but I know that there were some elements of

18    tombstone advertising.  On the other hand, this is

19    where I'm trying to check myself and be careful,

20   because the proposed resolution went further than

21    the FDA rule in'certain respects, and the one that

22   I remember that really sticks out in my mind is the

23   FDA rule would have permitted tombstone format

24    billboards out on the highways with tobacco

25   advertising.  The proposed resolution went further

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-9444454pgNbr=317
Page t28

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   Chan that and said no billboards whatsoever.  So I

3   believe, although I'm not 100 percent certain, that 4       the McCain bill also would simply ban  banned

5   billboards.

6        Q.   You indicated earlier that Philip Morris

7   currently supports some form of FDA regulation of

8   tobacco products; is that correct?

9        A.    Yes.  The comprehensive meaningful

10   effective form.

11        Q.   Can you describe what you mean by "the

12   comprehensive meaningful effective form"?

13        A.    Philip Morris USA right now is both on

14    record and also en the ground actively supporting

15   legislation.  And we have identified a specific

16   bill that would do these things, that would give

17   FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products

18   under a separate chapter, a new chapter of the FDA

19   bill  of the FDA statute, that would give FDA the

20   power and authority to insure that all tobacco

21   products that are sold in the country are not

22   adulterated; that none of them are misbranded, have

23   any false or misleading particulars on their

24   labeling/ that FDA would have the power to  t:o 2 5       find out by brand everything that's in every

2    tobacco product; that they would disclose

3    ingredients; that they would be given the power to

4    measure tar and nicotine and other smoke

5    constituents in their discretion by whatever method

6    they deem to be the right method; that FDA would be

7    empowered to set performance standards that would

8    hopefully be geared towards reducing the harm

9    caused by tobacco products; that they would be able

10    to order that added ingredients that they

11    considered to increase the inherent health risks of

12    smoking be banned or eliminated from the product;

13    that they would be empowered to set performance

14    standards that would remove or reduce harmful smoke

15    constituents that are considered by them to be

16    harmful; that they are empowered to have full

17    authority over reduced risk tobacco products, both

18    in determining what is and is not a reduced risk

19   tobacco product; and also in any marketing claims

20   made about such products that they considered to be

22    new warning labels for cigarettes in their

23    discretion, any text that they want; that they

24    would be  that they would have the power to

25   disclose smoke constituents, disclose ingredients;

2    that they would have the power over brand

3   distribucors such as light and ultra light and be A        able to regulate them to make sure that they are !>        not false or misleading; that they would have the

6   power to impose good manufacturing practices to

7   .insure that all of the industry's operations are up S        to a particular standard.

9                               And that's some of what we are

1C        supporting right now.  I don't think all.

11         Q.    Would there be  you said you've

12    identified a particular bill.  Does that bill have

13    a bill number or bill sponsor by which it's known?

14         A.    It's HR 3940.  The Mclntyre Davis bill.

15    The particular reason that the company has

16    indicated its support for that bill is, not only

17    does it have all the elements of comprehensive

18   effective FDA regulation  I left out something

19   very important that I want to come back to -- it

20   has both an FDA component and tobacco quota buyout

21    component to eliminate the existing tobacco program

22    and give a buyout to the farmers somewhat like what

23    were  was proposed by President Clinton's

24    president commission on tobacco agriculture.  The

25    companies have concluded that that's very

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538352pgNbr=320

2   important, because FDA regulation of cigarettes has

3   not attracted much support in Congress.  A lot of

4   the opposition to it has come from tobacco state b       members, but they are very responsive to the

6   demands and the needs of their growers.  Their

7   growers want this quota buyout, so the Mclntyre

8   Davis bill is the only bill that's been introduced

9   so far that has both effective, comprehensive FDA

10   regulation and the tobacco quota buyout, so we

11   believe it has the best chance of being politically 3 2       feasible and actually getting passed by Congress.

13             Now, when 1 was going over the litany of

14   what is in the FDA bill, the other thing that's in

15   the bill is FDA authority over marketing and access

16   of tobacco products, especially marketing and

17   access practices that -- in other words, they would

18   be empowered to impose marketing and access

19   restrictions that are designed to make sure that

20   kids are not exposed to tobacco marketing and don't.

21   have access to tobacco products.

22        Q.    In your answer you indicated that the

23   bill would authorize  would the Davis bill

24   require disclosure of brand-specific ingredients to

25   FDA?

2        A.    Yes.     By brand, by quantity, specific

3    amounts, specific lists of every single ingredient.

4    Those include the brand recipes, of course, so the

5    Davis bill provides that, as it does with other

6   products, FDA would keep those brand-specific

7    recipes confidential, but they would be not only

8    empowered to but directed to require by regulation

9    that the tobacco companies, cigarette companies

10    smokeless tobacco companies disclose, on a by-brand

11    basis, ingredients information to the same degree

12    that food products currently to do.  That's to the

13    public.

14         Q.          Which is to say, as I think you were

15    describing earlier, there would be a list  of

16    flavorances offered, flavorings added that might be

17    additives and flavorings; is that correct?

18         A.   That's the public disclosure, FDA would

19    have all that information.  They would have all of

20    the specific ingredients, specific amounts as well.

21         Q.    You also mentioned FDA would have the

22    authority to regulate brand descriptors?

23        A.    Yes, not only would they have the

24    authority to regulate it, the Davis bill

25    specifically requires FDA to regulate brand

2   descriptors.  Within 12 months after the enactment

3   of the legislation it requires them to do two

4   things:  Number one, make sure to the extent

5   descriptors are permitted that a disclaimer is

6   included in the advertising of any such brand

7   that's light or ultra light, indicating that lights

8   are not safer than any other brand; and then it

9   also requires them to do a general regulatory

10   proceeding within 12 months to make sure that the

11   use of such terms is neither false nor misleading.

12        Q.    Does Philip Morris believe that the use

13   of the brand descriptors currently is false or

14   misleading?

15             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

16        A.    The position of Philip Morris USA and

17   Philip Morris International on brand descriptors is

18   described currently on both of their websites in

19   some detail.  The position is that, as described on

20   those sites, is that brand descriptors give

21   indications to smokers, to adult smokers, of

22   strength of taste or lightness of taste and

23   reported tar and nicotine as measured by the

24   machine yield  by the machine test, keeping in

25   mind that there are lots of criticisms of that

Page 134

1                Beilind - Confidential

2   machine test.  And therefore the company's position

3   on the descriptors is that that is useful

4   information, that adult smokers want to get that

5   information; and so, the descriptors should be

6   regulated, but they should continue to be

7   permitted.

8        Q.   Are you aware of any tobacco companies

9   that have agreed that brand descriptors are false

10   and misleading  excuse me, strike the question.

11             Are you aware whether any other tobacco

12   companies have agreed to stop using brand

13   descriptors, because they are misleading to

14   consumers?

15             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

16        A.    To break it into two parts, I have a

17   non-specific recollection that a small company has

18   recently stopped using them.  I have no idea

19   whether they have stated that that's the reason or

20   not.

21        Q.    What company are you referring to?

22        A.    I want to say Star Tobacco, but I'm not

23   sure if that's right.

24        Q.    How did you hear about that?

25        A.    In the newspaper.

2        Q.    Have you been part of any internal

3    discussions within Philip Morris concerning Star

'1        Tobacco's decision to stop using brand descriptors?

5         A.   No.

6         Q.   Are you aware of whether any discussion

7    within Philip Morris has occurred on this topic?

8         A.    I'm aware of discussions having occurred

9    internally on the topic of descriptors.

10         Q.    But not in connection with Star

11    Tobacco's recent decision to stop using --

12         A,    Not specifically that, no.

13         Q.    If  strike that.

14               Is Philip Morris prepared to stop using

15    brand descriptors, if  no if.  Is Philip Morris

16    prepared to stop using brand descriptors?

17               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

18         A.    Let me start by saying I don't even

19   buy Philip Morris, so I'm not the company, I'm a

20    lawyer of the company.

21               I can tell you what Philip Morris1

22   position  I told you what their position on

23   descriptors is.  I have also told you that they

24    support in this country the legislation that I have

25    described which would give FDA the power to ban the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=325

1.                                               Berlind - Confidential

2    descriptors, if it concluded that they were false

3   and misleading, as being used, including with the

4    affixation of a disclaimer.  So Philip Morris USA

5    is supporting that legislation, and that means to G       me that they are supporting the idea that the FDA

7   might take action in that area.

8         Q.          Do you know whether Philip Morris has

9    conducted any independent research to determine

10    whether terms like "light" and "ultra light" are

11    misleading to consumers?

12         A.    I'm not aware of any such research.

13               I would supplement  go ahead.

14         Q.    Please.

15         A.    I would supplement that answer by saying

16    that there's obviously a lot of  there's external

17    research  research external to the company on

18    that topic of what consumers believe and that some

19    of that research indicates or concludes that some

20    consumers think that those descriptors mean things

21    that the company says they are not trying to imply,

22    in terms of being less risky; and some of that

23    research also shows that a lot of consumers or

24    significant percentages of those consumers think

25    that those terms mean what they are intended to

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=326
rage 137

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2   mean, which is that it's a lighter tasting

3   cigaretLe that has lower tar, as measured by the

4   machine tests.

5        Q.   When you say significant numbers of

6   consumers, can you quantify that any further?

7        A.    I can quantify it very roughly.  I'm

8   thinking of the recent report issued by the

9   National Cancer Institute as an example which was 10       critical of the use of descriptors overall, no

13        doubt about it, but even that report and in the

12   context of a very critical report, they themselves

13   cite the data that indicated, I think it was

14   between 30 and 4 0 percent consumers indicating

15   lighter taste as the number one message that they

16   took away from the "lights" descriptor.  So that

17   was the thing I was thinking of when I said that.

18        Q.   What does Philip Morris intend to do to

19   address the fact that some of its consumers, it's

20   aware, believe the descriptors "light" and "ultra

21    light" to have health connotations? 22.                              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23        A.    Again, to start the answer by

24    reiterating that I am not even a lawyer to the 2b        Philip Morris  either of the Philip Morris

2   tobacco operations, I don't work directly with the

3   operations people in Philip Morris USA or Philip A       Morris International, so in terms of what their

5   specific commercial plans are, I don't know.

6             In terms of what Philip Morris USA and

7   Philip Morris International are doing as a policy

8   matter, they have done a number of things.  They

9   have actively for several years now communicating

10   proactively on their websites, putting that message

11   out which is intended to make sure that from  at

12   least from the company's perspective, consumers are

13   being proactively informed as to what the

14   descriptors are intended to signify and what they lb       are not intended to signify.  Philip Morris USA, as

16   a follow-up to the website communications, printed

17   hard copy brochures of the same messages and mailed

18   them to literally millions of people.  Every smoker

19   in its adult smoker database received copies of

20   this information.

21              Philip Morris International, Philip

22   Morris USA are both proactively pursuing government:

23   regulation, or they are advocating that: governments

24   try to come up with a coherent policy on brand

25   descriptors.  And when you consider this question

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538360

3990538360pgNbr=328
Page 139

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2   of what people are thinking and what they ought, to

3   be thinking, I think it needs to be ~- it ought, to A        be pointed out and stated that the  it's the

5    governments themselves, including the U.S.

6    government, that for many years were putting out

7    the message that lighter cigarettes or low tar

8    cigarettes were apt to be less risky than full

9    flavor.  So if there are consumers who think that

10    today, that would be a very powerful reason why

11    they would think that.

12               And indeed policy around the world, not

13    in this country necessarily, continues to suggest

14    that, because in places like the European Union and 1!)        other countries, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, they have

16    tar ceilings and nicotine ceilings that they keep

17    lowering, and the reason they keep setting them and

18    lowering them is because those governments believe

19    that lighter, lower-yielding cigarettes, even by

20    the current machine method, are somehow better than

21    the higher tar cigarettes.  So the companies, both

22    their position and their action in this area is

23   designed to try to get the governments to have a

24    coherent policy.

25               If a government, including the U.S.

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=329
Page 140

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   government, concludes  and I know the NCI report

3   had messages to this effect, but the government

4   with the policy-making apparatus behind it, If the

5   government wants to conclude that low tar is not

       any safer, the government should require that that

7   message be affixed to every advertisement  that

8   advertises such product.  We support that.

9             If, on the other hand, the government

10   concludes that there is some benefit, however

11   tangential, the government ought to tell consumers

12   that they can have that information.  What we are

13   doing is not advocating any particular view as to

14   whether they are or are not safer, we are trying to

15   get the government to come to a point of view.  It

16   seems rather to us like it's not coherent right now

17   wJ^at various governments are doing on this subject,

18   and we would like to work with them to sort it out.

19        Q.    Does  would Philip Morris support

20   government efforts to change the format and size of

21   health warnings put on cigarette packaging and

22   advertising?

23             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

24        A.    HR 3940, the Mclntyre Davis bill,

25   which Philip Morris USA has indicated it will

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=330
Page 141

1                Derlind - Confidential

2   support, would increase the size of the labels to

3   25 percent of the pack, 20 percent of the

4   advertisement and require that the text messages be

5   black on white or white on black.  That's a big

6   change from today,

7        Q.    And the change that you are referring to

8   is the size of the warning?

.9       A.   It's the size and the format.  Lettering

10   and whatnot would be much bigger to fill up that

11   bigger space.  Also the. black on white or white on

12   black format would make it stand out more starkly

13   against the facing of the pack.

14        Q.    Has Philip Morris conducted any research

15   into the effectiveness of the boxed health warnings 1()       that currently exist on cigarette packaging?

17                             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

lEi        A.    You are saying the current warnings,

19   the effectiveness of the current warnings?

20        Q.    Yes.

21        A.    I'm not aware of any research conducted

22   by Philip Morris USA or Philip Morris

23   International.  I am aware of substantial external

24   survey after survey after survey that demonstrates 2b       universal awareness of the risks and the dangers of

	smoking.  So based on the even the fact, that the

3
	public is universally ax^are of the dangers of

4
	smoking, I feel confident in saying that either the

h
	warnings are doing a good job or people knew even

6
	without the warnings on the pack.

	referring to.

2 3

2        time  in  the  year 2000?

3                  A.         No,   it's  not.

']       Q.   When did Philip Morris first state its

!>        agreement that smoking causes the diseases you just

6   mentioned?

7        A.    That's a different question.  You first

8    said knowledge, not agreement.  Agreement was first

9    inr as far as I know, it was in October of 2000.

10         Q.   When did Philip Morris first state

11    publicly its knowledge that smoking causes any of

12    the diseases that you  all of the diseases you

13    just mentioned?

14         A.   Well, there's a long history of Philip

15    Morris USA and Philip Morris International

16    discussing the risks and the dangers of smoking in n        different contexts and describing those risks and

18    dangers in various ways.  So I was reacting to your

19    question about knowledge, as if  because you made

20    it sound as if they first became aware there wa;; an

21    issue here was in 2000, which I'm saying was not

22    the case.  But they have been publishing and

23    stating positions on smoking and health for many

24    years now.

25         Q.    When Philip Morris was first required to

Page 144

1                 Berlind - Confidential

2   state by the government on its packages that

3   smoking causes disease, did it agree with that

4    statement?

5              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

6        A.    Now you are talking about 1969 or

7   19 65, which I think was 1965, when the first

8   warning labels were required.  So I was pretty

9   young then, and I don't really want to speak to

10   what the company's position was.

11              But subject to that limitation, my

12   understanding was that during that period, say

13   sixties and seventies, the company's position on

14    smoking and health was that there was scientific

15   uncertainty in terms of whether smoking caused

16   disease or not.

17              MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's go off the record.

18              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 2:41.

19        This is the end of the videotaped deposition

20        of Mr. Mark Berlind.

21              (Whereupon, there is a recess in the

22        proceedings.)

23              THE VIDECGRAPHER:  The time is 2:S3. 2 4                  We are back on the record.

25                  Q.    You made reference a few minutes ago

2    to the Monograph 13 published recently by the

3    National Cancer Institute, do you recall that?

4          A.    Yes.

5          Q-   What is Monograph 13?

6          A.    It is a report by the National Cancer

7    Institute on dealing broadly and generally with

8    lower yield or lighter cigarettes, broadly

9    speaking.

10          Q.    Have you read Monograph 13?

11          A.   That would be giving myself too much

12    credit.  I have scanned it and I read some passages

13    in it, but I didn't give it a thorough reading.

14          Q.   What's your understanding generally of

15    its conclusions?

16          A.   My understanding of it generally, and

17    again, speaking as a lay person, because a lot. of

18    it involves science and scientific studies, is that

19    the  well, the first part of it that I read

2 0         seemed to be suggesting or concluding or accepting

21    the idea that there is some type of dose response

22    relationship between tar and nicotine intake and

23    smoking-related disease.  So that I think -- and 1

24    could be getting it wrong  I think their premise

25    is that if indeed smokers were to intake less tar

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=335
Page 146

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    and nicotine from a cigarette than they are

3    otherwise intaking, that that would tend to lower A        their risk or lower their disease incidence or

5    reduce the harm caused by smoking.

6               But then they go on to say, and they

7    have a lot of discussion about a phenomenon

8    referred to as smoker's compensation, where smokers

9    in effect tend to make up for the lighter

10    deliveries by either, and again, speaking very

11    simpJ.istically, either smoking more cigarettes or

12    inhaling more deeply or what have you.  They wind

13    up concluding that lighter cigarettes do not offer IA        an overall health benefit as compared to full

15    flavored or higher yielding cigarettes, again, as

16   measured by the machine tests.

17         Q.    Have you done any work, in relation to

18   Monograph 13, at Philip Morris?

19               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

20         A.   The only work that I did, that I can

21    recall, is when it came out, literally when it

22    first came out, I took a look at the press release

23    and then I clicked on to find the full contents.

24    And the type of thing I would have done is look at 2 5         the chapter summaries, I think they had a summary

Esquire Deposition Services ] -800-944-9454pgNbr=336
Page 147

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   either at the beginning or end of each chapter, and

3   just get a feel for what the main conclusions were.

4   And then I sent an e-mail out to my clients who T

b       thought would have an interest in it, particularly

6   in government affairs, since it's currently a

7   legislative issue that they are working on, just

8   sort of generally describing my, you know, what the

9   reports seemed to be saying pretty, much along the

10   lines of the narrative I gave a minute ago.  Not to

11   educate it, but basically give them an alert as to

12   what the report was and what its broad conclusions

13   were.

14        Q,    Have you kept apprised of media coverage 13       of Monograph 13?

16             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

17        A.   Well, I think I'm aware of a lot of

18   the media coverage.  1 tend to follow media

19   coverage of smoking and health issues pretty

20   closely, in any event.  So I saw some of the

21   coverage and some of my clients in corporate

22   communications were interested in the coverage and

23   circulated some of it, so yes, I probably have a 

24    fairly apprised of it.

25        Q.    Have you seen media reports or

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=337
Page 148

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   commentary critical of Monograph 13?

3        A.    Yes, yes, I have.

4        Q.   Where have you seen such reports?

5j       A.    I saw an opinion piece written by a

6   Stamford professor named Jerry Bulow, he is a

7   professor of economics at Stanford, had done a

8   stint in Washington at. the FTC.  I'm not sure

9   exactly what he did there.  But he wrote, if I'm

10   remembering it correctly, a very critical piece

11   directed at NCI reports, saying that  I guess he

12   was questioning the scientific conclusions, which

13   I'm not sure how he got out thatr because I know

14   his discipline is economics.  But he was basically

15   saying that the government needed to figure out

16   what its policy ought to be and that it was clear

17   that lower tar deliveries would, in fact, be better

18   for smokers, but NCI was suggesting that they

19   wouldn't be.  And I don't remember what else he

20   said, but I do remember it was a very critical

21   article.

22        Q,    What did you do when you read the

23   article?

24             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

25        A.    I read it and I guess I reflected on

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=338
Page W)

1                    Berlind - Confidential

2    it.  I guess the one specific thing that I recall

.1        doing is circulating the article to some people who

A         I thought would be interested in it.

!>                                      Can I add to that answer?

6       Q.   Certainly.

1                     A.   Well, let me step back.  I had first.

8    become aware of the article, because Professor

9    Bulow let me know that it was being published.  He

10    had spoken to me a few years back in connection

11    with the proposed resolution, because he wrote a

12    very detailed analysis of that transaction and had

13    called in to the company looking for someone to

14    talk to, to help guide him through it.  And I had

15    had very little contact with him in the intervening

16    time, but he called me to let  in fact, I would

17    have found out about it the next day, because it

18    was coming out in Forbes, but he called me just, to

19    give me a heads up that the article was coming out

20   and then I sent the article around.

21                 And then something else happened,

22   which -- before I get into it, I'd like to, if J 2 3         can confer with my counsel before describing,

24    because I think it involves a privilege issue.

25          Q.           I guess if you could just complete your

2   answer to the question.

3             MR. FREDERICK:  Yes.  I'll instruct the

4        witness to exclude the portion he thinks may b       be privileged, and maybe at a break we will

6        ask the government  we will consult at a

7        break.

8        A.    That was the rest of the story.  The

9   rest of the story involves something that I think

10   might be privileged, in terms of your question

11   about what did I do about the article.

12        Q.    Did you circulate the document outside

13   of Philip Morris?

1']       A.    No.  It would have been only to internal

15   people.

16        Q.    Do you know that Philip Morris has used

17   that document in any way other than the circulation

18   to which you referred?

19             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

20        A.    I'm not aware of any use of itr so.

21   I'm not aware of any use of it.

22        Q,    Do you know if the government  if the

23   document was circulated to  was circulated beyond

24   your initial circulation to certain colleagues? 2b                A.    Well, I don't know, but I'm not trying

13          communications he had subsequent to the

14          distribution of the article, those

15          communications are privileged and work

5        of privilege that we might be entitled to?

6              MR. FREDERICK:  The communications 

7        I'm trying to think what's on the privilege

9        was a Philip Morris in-house attorney

10        regarding the article.

Having said that, the identity of the particular litigation question would likewise be confidential, to the extent the discussion pertained to the possible retention of Professor Bulow as a litigation consultant.

MR. DUFFY:  We would disagree with your position with respect to whether or not you would have to provide the name of specific litigation, but you also stated that there would be an attorney-client claim with respect to the information or the communication between the witness and Mr. Bulow.  What's the nature of the attorney-client arrangement?

MR. FREDERICK:  Weil, the nature of the attorney-client arrangement is Mr. Berlind and Mr. Mulderig are both in the business of advising Philip Morris.

3          communications with Professor Bulow, what's A                       the nature of that privilege?

b                                      MR. FREDERICK:  It's -- well, first; of

6          all, it's work product,  all right.

7          Secondly, it's in the flow of the litigation

8          advice that they provide.

9                  MR. GOLDFARB:  So there's no  it

10          can't be separated out from litigation.

11     RUL        MR. DUFFY;  We are going to object to

12          both your claims with respect to those

13          communications.  We are going to move to

14           compel the information  the communications

15           that you've just claimed are privileged and

16           subject to work product claim.  We are going

17           to mark the transcript at this point, and we

18           are going to proceed with some additional

19          testimony.  We will see how far we can get.

20              MR. FREDERICK:  Okay.  Shall we

21           retrieve the witness?

22                  MR. DUFFY:  Yes.

23                  {Witness present.)

2        record.

3        Q.    To whom did you circulate the article

4   by Professor  is it Bulow  is it Professor b       Bulow?

6        A.    I think it's pronounced Bulow.

7        Q.   Bulow.  To whom did you circulate the

8   article?

9        A.   Well, I don't remember exactly.  I

10   believe I would have circulated it to people like

11   John Scruggs, probably Mike File, corporate affairs

12   here in the U.S., perhaps Dave Davies, corporate

13   affairs of PMI, Peggy Roberts or someone  one of

14   her colleagues from corporate communications.  Then

15   a few members of the PMMC law department.

16        Q.    Which members of the PMMC legal

17   department would you have circulated this to?

18        A.   Again, in terms of what I either

19   remember, or, more to the point, guessing what I

20   think I probably did, it would have been Paula

21   Desel, PM USA, she's assigned to PM USA; Evan

22    Hurwitz, who is working with PM International; and 2 3         John Mulderig from PM litigation group and Tim

24   Wyndham from the litigation group.

25        Q.    When did you first see a copy of the

3990538380pgNbr=348
Page 159

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   Bulow article?

3        A.    I don't have any real  a firm fix for

4   what the dates are here.  It was sometime in the

b       last six months, and 1 saw it basically the day it

6   was posted on the Forbes website.  It was published

7   in Forbes, so it was  by the time I heard about

8   it, it was publicly available on the website, and

9   so I clicked on it and saw it at that time.

10        Q.   Had you indicated earlier that Professor

11   Bulow had contacted you before it was publicly

12   released?

13        A.   Well, maybe I indicated that, but in

14   fact he called me and said, you knowr it's coming

15   out in tomorrow's edition of Forbes.  And I went on

16   their website as I was on the phone with him still 3 7       and said, hey, it's up there right now.  So by the

18   time he called me, it was already up there.

19        Q.    So when he  he didn't provide a copy

20   to you prior to its public release; is that

21   correct?

22        A.   No.  He was simply calling because he

23   thought I would be interested in the article and he

24   wanted me to know  in fact, he didn't offer to

25   send it to me.  If I didn't get it on the website,

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=349
Page 160 1                                               Berlind - Confidential

7          I would have just waited like everyone else for it

3         to come out on hard copy.  As I said, he and 1 -- I

A          had spoken to him a couple years before about an

5    article he was doing, I think on the MSA, I forget

6    what the subject was; but we had spoken a couple of

7    times previously, and he just thought I would be

8    interested in seeing that he had written this

9    article.

10           Q.    You said he had done an article on the

11    MSA, is that 

12          A.    He had written on a number of topics in

13    the past.  As I had indicated, he had done a

14     lengthy article, and I don't think it was a

1!j         newspaper article, it was more like a published

16    paper relating to the proposed resolution, so that

17    was when I first came into contact with him.  And

18    then he had subsequently done some kind of Op-Ed

19    pieces.  I remember one of them appeared in the

20    Wall Street Journal.  I know one of them was on the

21    MSA, and I don't, know what else they were on.  They

22    were not on the subject of lights, the previous

2 3          work had not had anything to do with lights that I

24    was aware of.

25          Q.    Had Philip Morris ever had a consulting

7          the witness not to answer, to the extent

8          that  objection, instruct the witness not

10          witness, I can do that or, you know, have a

11          discussion off the record.

1.2                                   MR. GOLDFARB:  Well, I'll lodge an

13         objection and 

14                MR, FREDERICK:  Counsel, I'm going to

15          withdraw the instruction.  Okay.

16                Can you repeat the question.

17                THE WITNESS:  Let's repeat the IB                     question.

19                MR. GOLDFARB:  Could you please read

20          the question.

21                 (Record read.)

22          A.    No.

2 3                    Q.    Had Philip Morris had a financial  any

24    financial relationship with Professor Bulow prior

25    to you receiving notice about this article?

2        A.    None that I'm aware of.

3        Q.    Do you recall sending Professor Bulow an

4    article  an e-mail, after receiving -- strike the !j>         question.

6              Do you recall sending Professor Bulow an

7   e-mail, after reading the Forbes article?

8        A.    Yes.

9        Q.    Do you remember how long after you

10    reviewed it you responded to him by e-mail?

11         A.   Not precisely, but it was not a long

12    time after that.

13        Q.   What was the substance of your

14    communication  of that communication with lb        Professor Bulow?

16    DIR       MR. FREDERICK:  Object.  Instruct the

17        witness not to answer, to the extent it may IB       reveal privileged information.

19              MR. GOLDFARB:  Objection.

2 3       h.          Part of what I said to him, and I

24    don't remember it with any specificity, but it was

4

6

9
	MR. GOLDFARB:  Objection.

2        A.   It's the e-mail to which we were just

3   discussing.  It's the e-mail we were just

4   discussing.

5             MR. FREDERICK:  I just note for the

6        record I withdraw the instruction not to

7        answer regarding this e-mail.  He may

8        testify regarding the content of the e-mail.

9        Q.   Does this refresh your recollection 10       about whether you may have said anything else to

1 ]        Professor Bulow in this communication?

12        A.    Yes, it does.

13        Q.   And what else did you communicate to

14   Professor Bulow in this communication?

15        A.    I communicated information back to him.

16   Since he was kind enough to call his article to my

17   attention, I in turn called to his attention our PNI IB       USA website statements relating to this topic,

19   which I thought would be of interest to him, if he

20   was going to continue writing on the subject.

21             He had raised some important policies in

22   his article.  Again, I don't have the article in

2 3       front of me, but I believe, as I sit here and tty 24       and remember the article, that he was arguing or 2b       concluding that the government was doing a

2   disservice to smokers by discouraging them, in the

3   form of the NCI report, if they are going to smoke,

4   from buying low yield products which he

b       considered  considers to be less risky.  So in

0   turn, I sent back to him our policy statements

1   which I then characterize and describe here in the y       e-mail.

9                             I then also wish him a happy New Year

10   and ask him if he  tell him if he wants more

11   information from us, we are always happy to help

12   out.

13             MR. GOLDFARB:  If we could ask the

14        witness just to leave the room for a moment

15        again so we can have a discussion outside of

16        the witness's presence, we'd appreciate it.

17        Thank you.

18              {Witness not present.)

19             MR. GOLDFARB:  I just want to clarify

20        that the  and I want to clarify that the

21        request was drawn, with respect to the this 2.2       communication with Professor Bulow, and I

3        Professor Bulow?

4              MR. GOLDFARB:  Yes.

5              MR. FREDERICK:  Here's what I'd like

6        to do:  I'd like to consult with the client,

7        determine the exact extent of those

8        communications, and substance; and then I'll

9        come back in and let you know whether or not

10        and to what extent we will withdraw the

11        objection.

12              MR. DUFFY:  There may be other

13        publicly available information that goes to

14        this communication as well.  There may be a 3 5                  waiver claim and actual attorney-client or

16        work product claim; but nonetheless, it

17        sounds like it would be a good idea for you :i 8                   to consult with the client at this time as

19        to whether or not that privilege applies or

20        to the extent the privilege applies.  But

21        we'd like to try to move on with the

22        testimony as soon as possible.  Understood?

23              MS. RAGSDALE:  Anything you have that

24        would indicate that, that we can discuss

Berlind - Confidential time.  So if you have any publicly available information you know is out there that we can discuss with him, it would help investigate.

MR. DUFFY:  I guess what I'm trying to say to you is that on Philip Morris' website, for example, there may be some documents that go to this.  We may not have all those with us in the present.  We are here in New York City, our offices are in Washington, D.C., we don't have the web in front of us.

We've done our best to prepare for the deposition.  We didn't think this issue with respect to this portion of his communication would actually come up, because we thought the nature of the publicly available documents would probably obligate such an issue.  It sounds like maybe we can move on, if you have an opportunity to consult.

MR. FREDERICK:  I just need to know what the story is, just so I can rethink the instruction.

MR. DUFFY:  Just so we understand

2        there's been a lifting of the instruction

3        with respect to this e-mail?

4              MR. FREDERICK:  Certainly with respect 'j                  to the e-mail.

6                              MR. DUFFY:  And we made a request to

1                  you that there be a lift of the instruction

8        which we've noted we were going to move to

9        compel in all events with respect to the

10        nature of the relationship generally.

11              MR. FREDERICK:  Understood.

12              MR. DUFFY:  Okay.

13              MR. FREDERICK:  We will go off the

15              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 3:31.

19              THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 3:43.

20        We are back on the record.

21              MR. FREDERICK:  If I may, for the

22        record, I have consulted with the witness

23        regarding the subject matter of the

2 4                  testimony by which he's being questioned

2!3                   before the break.  Based on that

2        consultation, I have determined there's no

3        attorney-client privilege claim with respect

4        to the communications.  There is potentially b                  work product claim. However, not pertaining

6        to communications which Mr. Berlind had

7        regarding this matter, and he can tesrify

8        fully.  And so we withdraw the prior

9        instruction not to answer with respect to

10        this line.

11              MR. DUFFY:  That would go, if I may

12        just for a moment, with the witness present, 3 3                  but that would go as well to the prior

14        instruction that we had colloquy between

15        counsel on as well, the first instruction?

16              MR. GOLDFARB:  That's the one to which

17        you were referring?

18              MR. FREDERICK:  That's right.  That's

19        the one that's being withdrawn.

22        Q.   Did you have further contact with

25        Q.   When?

2         A.    In the weeks following.  I don't know

3    precisely when.

A                   Q.   Can you describe those communications?

5        A.    There were  there was one or two phone

6   calls, one or two phone calls where I asked him if,

7    having written that article and gotten into this

8    subject matter, which was, as I understood it, a

9    new subject matter for him, whether he would be

10    interested in working with Philip Morris Management

11    Corp. as a consultant on the issue of descriptors

12    and low yield cigarettes.  So that was really the

13    gist of the conversations.  And he ultimately 1'!        decided that he was not interested.

lb                   Q.    Were there communications other than --

16    were these telephone conversations that you are

17    describing?

IB       A.   They were one or two telephone

19    conversations between he and I.  And I may have

20    sent him a follow-up e-mail or two, but I don't

21    remember if I did or not.

22.        Q.    Did Professor Bulow give a reason for

23    declining to pursue your exploration further, or

24    your offer, I don't know if it was a formal offer, 2 5        but your exploration further?

2               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

3        A.    I didn't make any  all I did was

4    find out whether he would be interested in

5    exploring it.  Any concrete discussions about what

6    it would entail or what it might involve did not

7    involve me, it involved other people, either -- who 3        were retained by PMMC, and his ultimate decision

9       was not communicated by hirn to me, it was

10    communicated by others.

11         Q.    Who communicated that information ~o

12    you?

13         A.          It was either John Mulder.ig from PM

14    management Corp. legal department or one of his

15    outside counsel.

16         Q.    Do you know which outside counsel?

17         A.          If it was outside counsel, it would have

18    been Bill Maledon, who is based out in Phoenix.

19         Q.          Is Mr. Maledon the retained counsel to

20   which you referred, in terms of who would have had

21    the further discussions with Professor Bulow?

22         A.          I didn't participate in any of those

23    discussions, but my understanding was that

?A        Mr. Maledon was going to have those discussions

25        with him.

2         Q.    Do you know what firm Mr. Maledon is

3    with?

4         A,    It's called Maledon and something, but I b        don't know what else.

6         Q.   Other than the e-mail and the two

7    conversations you described, did you have any

8    further contact with Professor Bulow?

9        A.    No.

10         Q.    And Professor Bulow is not a scientist,

11    is that what you said, he's an economist?

12         A.    I think some people consider economists

13    to be scientists.  Depends on your point of view.

14    I believe his discipline is economics.

lb                   Q.   Do you know whether he's ever studied

16    the phenomenon of compensation?

17         A.    I don't know.

1.8       Q.    Do you agree with the statement that

19   price increases generated by tobacco tort

20    settlements have pushed smokers into higher tar and

21    nicotine cigarettes?

22         A.    That must be from his article.  Do I

23    agree?  I don't have -- I don't really have a

24    basis, factually, to agree or disagree.  I have an

25    intuitive policy understanding and the argument

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538394pgNbr=362
Page 173

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    that he was making, if I understood it correctly,

3    and I believe that is Professor Bulow's argument,

4    is that because of the recent significant price

5    increases in cigarettes by the four major

6   manufacturers brought upon by the MSA, Master

7    Settlement Agreement, and also brought upon by

8    significant state and federal tax increases, more

9    smokers are trading down to either generic or deep,

10    what's called in the industry deep discount brands.

11    And indeed he may have been referring to the fact

12    that the market share of non-participating

13   manufacturers, small companies who are not pari: of

14    the Master Settlement Agreement, has really risen

15    significantly in the last few years.  In fact, I

16    think it's gone from less than two percent to

17    something around eight percent, which is a huge 3 8        market share increase.  Those companies tend to

19    distribute deep discount or generic brands.  So

20    that's part  that's the first step in his

21    argument.

22               I think the second step is that those

23    deep discount brands tend to be higher yielding

24    brands, as measured by the machine test.  They tend

25    not to be lights or ultra lights, they tend to be

2   regular, for all I know, in filter or unfiltered

3   cigarettes that are unflavor.

4             It's kind of A to B to C, if a lot of b       smokers, because of the price increases and

6   whatnot, are smoking deep discount brands or buy

7   whoever, whoever they are manufactured by, then

8   they -- I think he's saying they tend to be smoking

9   higher yield brands.  And that all comports with my

10   general understanding of the facts, but I have

11   never investigated the facts that would support

12   that.

13        Q.   Did you ever have any discussions about.

14   professor  with Professor Bulow about the basis lb       for any of the statements in his article?

16        A.    No.

17        Q.    Do you agree with the statement that the

18   NCI's conclusions in Monograph 13, with respect to

19   the health hazards of low tar cigarettes, are

20   harmful to the public health?

21        A.    When you say do I agree or are you

22   asking me for a company position on that?

23        Q.    Do you agree?

24             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

25        A.    Personally?

2               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

3        A-    You are asking me personally.  Can you

4    read me the statement you are asking me  read me b       his conclusion, and I'll tell you whether I agree

6   with it personally.

7         Q.          My question is do you agree with the

8    statement that NC  the conclusions reached in

9   NCI's Monograph 13 that low tar cigarettes have not

10    yielded lower incidence of smoking-related diseases

11    is a harmful conclusion with respect to the public

12    health?

13               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

14         A.   No.  Personally I neither agree nor LL)        disagree with that.

16         Q.    Do you know whether the company has a

17    position about the effects on the public health of 1.8        the conclusions reached in NCI Monograph 13?

19        A.   The company's position, PM USA and PMI's

20    position is that smokers should not assume that

21    lower yield products represent any benefit to

22    public health.  So the company is, again  and I

23    believe this is, in part, its fulfilling, its

24    continued fulfillment of its commitment to support 2b        a single health message and defer to the government

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=365

2    on these sorts of things -- is not trying to

3    advocate to smokers one way or another whether low

4    yield either is better for their health or is not? b         and then, conversely, NCI's statement that it's

6    not, the company is not trying to advocate that

7    that is a good thing or a bad thing.

8                  What the company would like is for 

9    when I say the company, I mean both PM USA and PM

10    International  what they would like is get

11    government and adopt a public coherent policy

12    which you have, for example, in the European Union,

13    where Philip Morris International does business, a

14     tobacco directive  that's the way they legislate lb         over there, they issue things call directives 

1 6         and the directive simultaneously lowers the

17    existing tar ceiling down to ten milligrams,

18    because they believe that is better for their

19    citizens' health; and at the same time the same

20    directive takes a step towards regular  towards

21    banning the use of descriptors like "light," which

22    convey to people lower tar or lower nicotine, that

23    strikes the companies as not being a particularly

24     coherent: or consistent position.  So what the

2 5         companies would like and what they are actively

2    seeking is for the governments to figure out what

3    their point of view is on the health effects.

4    Either there are reduced or there are not or it's

5    worse than full flavor, any of those conclusions,

6    if the government would articulate them, I think

7   would be acceptable to the company, and the

8    companies would defer to those conclusions as a

9    matter of fulfilling their commitments under the 10          Hatch statement and then they would proceed

1 1          accordingly.  Right now there is lack of clarity in

12     terms of government policy, from the company's

13    perspective.

14           Q.    You referred earlier to  you mentioned

15     the phrase, in discuss.ing Professor Bulow's

16    article, "non-participating manufacturers."

17           A.    Yes.

18        Q.    To what are you referring?

19           A.    I'm referring  it's a defined term

2 0          under the Master Settlement Agreement, which I'll

21   refer to as the MSA, and it simply means cigarette

22    manufacturers that have not  here in the United 2:5          States, who distribute products here in the United 24          States, who have not signed the settlement

2b         agreement.

2         Q.    Can you describe briefly how

3    non-participating manufacturers are treated under

4    the MSA?

5               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

6         A.    Okay.  And qualified by based on my

7    familiarity with the MSA, which I have had occasion

8    to read and work with to some degree,

9    non-participating manufacturers are not bound by

10    the MSA.  By definition, they haven't signed it.

11    So the agreement itself I would say does not have

12    any effect on them.  For example, they are not:

13    bound by the advertising restrictions, they are not \4        bound by the lobbying restrictions, they are not

lb        bound by the provision in the agreement that says

If-        that they can't make statements that misrepresent.

17    the health effects of smoking/ they are not bound

18    by the provisions that say they can't conspire with

19    other tobacco companies to suppress information

20    about smoking and health, they are not bound by the

21    provision that says that they have to submit their

22    documents on a continual basis to internet sites

2 3          so they are continually published.  They don't have

24    to do any of that stuff  They don't have to make

25    the payments.  So that's how they are; treated.

19    article.  That paragraph is called "Advantage to

2   provisions.  What is he referring to by the phrase

3    "significant protections we obtained through the

4    NPM provisions"?

5               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection's        A.    What I believe he's referring to is a

7    portion of the MSA that is not  as I said

8    earlier, nothing in the MSA is binding upon

9    non-participating manufacturers, but there are

10    provisions that I bet you he's referring to as the

11    NPM provisions/ because what they do is say -- is

12    provide that the payments that the participating

13   manufacturers make under the settlement get reduced

14    under a series of complicated circumstances.  And

15    those circumstances involve, again to the best; of

16    my knowledge and understanding, that if a

17    participating manufacturer loses market share over

18    a period of time, and that's number one, and number

19    two, that market share is lost not to participating 2 0        manufacturers but to manufacturers who are

21    non-participating manufacturers, then that

22    manufacturer who has lost market share is entitled

23    to pay less settlement money under the MSA.  That's

24    kind of part one.

2 5                                But part two, that credit or that

?          ability not to pay as much is offset or doesn't.

3    kick in, if the state in question or -- if the

4     state in question who is looking for the settlement

5    money has passed a statute, and there was a model

6    of the statute appended to the MSA, so any state

1          that passed the statute was not subject to having

8     its settlement payments reduced as I just

9    described.

10                  And what the statute did was establish

11     escrow provisions, pursuant to which manufacturers

12     of tobacco products who don't choose not to

13    participate in the MSA are required to deposit

14    money on an ongoing basis into escrow accounts to

15    be held for 25 years as an escrow account to

16     satisfy potential tort claims that the state would 1'7          have against those manufacturers with whom they

18    have not settled, and that's the way it works.

19           Q.    Why is that referred to as a protection

20    in the handwritten note from Mr. Camilleri?

21                  MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

22        A.    I can't purport to tell you what was;

23     in his mind when he wrote it, but I would

24     characterize it as a protection for participating 2h         manufacturers in the sense that, and this was

2    contemplated by the agreement and agreed to by the

3    Attorneys General as being fair and appropriate,

4    that if a participating manufacturer who decides

5    not to participate in the settlement is not bound

6    by the marketing restrictions, is not bound by any

7    of the myriad restrictions that are in their

8    agreement, does not -- is not under the ambit of

9    the Attorneys Genera] and is not subject to all of

10    the processes that are put in place to insure that.

11     the products are being marketed and sold

12    responsibly, if market share is lost to those kind

13    of companies, then the settlement payment would be

14    reduced.  So that is a protection.  The

:i b         participating manufacturers have a protection in

16    the sense that they pay less money if they lose

17    market share under certain circumstances to :i 8          companies that aren't abiding by all the

19         restrictions that participating manufacturers

2 0         agreed to abide by.

21          Q.   Other than the payments to the states,

22    are there other provisions that -- in the MSA, that

23    involve payments by participating manufacturers

24    that could be reduced h^sed on market share growth

25    of non-participating manufacturers?

2               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

3         A.    I think I know what you are  could

4    you take another try.

5         Q.   Sure.

6               You just referred to one situation in

7    the MSA where payments to the state are reduced

8    based on  growing market share of non-participating

9   manufacturers.

10         A.    Correct.

11         Q.   Are there other such provisions of the 12.        MSA that don't  that involve payments by -- are

13    there other such payments in the MSA  strike the

14    question.

15               Are there other such provisions in the

16   MSA?

17         A.    There's a provision by which a company's

18    payments can be reduced.  It's a  that's what I

19   would refer to as the volume reduction clause or

20    provision.  But it doesn't have anything to do with

21    non-participating manufacturers.  It's  no matter

22    what happens in terms of market share, as volumes 2 3        decline for any manufacturer, settlement payments

2 4        decline.  So there's a lot of mechanisms in the MSA

25        having to do with how the payments are calculated

2    every year, and I certainly don't purport to be an 1        expert on them, but [ understand that there is a

4    volume -- a volume adjustment, so maybe that's

5    responsive to what you are asking.

6         Q.   Are the payments that participating

7    manufacturers make to the American Legacy

8    Foundation tied to market share?

9               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection. .1.0       A.    I don't know.

11               Well, let me give you two answers.  I

12    believe the payments that are made to the legacy

13    foundation are  maybe I should stick with I don't

14    know.  There's two questions in there, which is the lb        aggregate amount that's due the legacy foundation,

16    is that tied to volume in some way, and then that's

17    one question that I can think of here.  And then --

18    that I think you are asking.  And number two is in

19    terms of the aggregate amount, how is that divided

20    up amongst the participating manufacturers to equal

21    100 percent.  And I will tell you I don't really

22    know the answer to either of those questions.

23         Q.    Are there any other NPM provisions

24    that  in the MSA that you are aware of that 2b        Mr. Camilleri could have been referring to as

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=376
Page 187

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2   protections for the participating manufacturers?

3              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

4        A.    I'm not aware of any.

5              Again, I want to emphasize, by the terms

6   of its own operation, the MSA doesn't affect NPMs

7    at all.  If a state chooses, now at the present

8    time or if it chose in the past tense, to enact a

9    statute as contemplated by the agreement, the

10    statute would have an affect on NPMs. But the NPMs

11    are not signatories to the agreement, and are not

12    affected by the operation of its terms, that you

13    can't -- no AG, no Attorney General can  go into a

14    court and bring any kind of action with respect to II)        anything against a non-participating manufacturer.

16    But there are now state laws in states, and AG's

17    might have enforcement powers under those statutes,

18    which is just the operation of state law.

19              MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's go off the record

20         for a second.

3        Q.   Mr. Berlind, were you involved in

4    Philip Morris1 negotiations that resulted in the !')        entry of the Master Settlement Agreement?

6              MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

7        A.    No.

B                   Q.   At the time the Master Settlement

9       Agreement was negotiated and entered in 1998, you

10   were still in worldwide regulatory affairs; is that

11    right?

12         A.    Yes.

13         Q.   Do you know who was primarily

14    responsible for negotiating the MSA on Philip

15   Morris' behalf?

16               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

17        A.    Not directly, but indirectly my belief

18    is that the principal negotiators for Philip Morris

19   USA were outside counsel at Wachtell Lipton.

2 0        Q.    And how about at Philip Morris, were

21    there in-house people primarily responsible?

22               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

2 3       A.    Yes.  I'm sure there were, but I don't

24    know how that was structured or how that team

25    functioned.

1U       Settlement Agreement.

11        Q.   And you testified earlier, did you not,

12   that you weren't aware of joint industry meetings

13   in connection with the negotiations that ended up

14   as the Master settlement Agreement; is that lb       correct?

U)                             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

18   any such meetings.  I don't think I said that I

19   doubted that any such meetings occurred, I just

20   said that I'm not personally aware of them.

2    principal negotiators on the MSA.  My further

3    understanding would have been that Meyer Koplow, if

4    you can characterize someone as a lead negotiator, !>         it would have been Meyer, but I don't know how the

6    responsibilities were allocated between him and

7    Mr. Wachtell.

8          Q.    Have you participated in meetings

9    attended by Mr. Bible?

10          A.    On anything?

11          Q.    Yes.

12          A.    Yes.

13          Q.   Can you estimate how many instances in

14    which you've been at meetings with Mr. Bible?

lb                                      Let me clarify the question.  I'm not

16    referring to sort of general shareholder meetings

17    or large public gatherings, but referring to

18    internal Philip Morris meetings.

19                  MR. FREDERICK: Objection.

20        A.    I really hesitate to try to give you a

21    number that I can vouch for with any kind of

22    accuracy.  I would sayr for purposes of our

2 3         discussion here, over the six years I have been at

24          Philip Morris it would be probably less than 50. 2b                      Q.    Have you been involved at all in the

2    drafting of statements posted on Philip Morris'

3    website?

4         A,   I was involved  when you say Philip b       Morris, there's Philip Morris USA's website,

6   there's Philip Morris International and there's

7    Philip Morris Companies.  I was involved in

8    providing legal advice with respect to the website

9    pages that were known as, and I think are still

10    known as, the tobacco issues pages.  I was involved

11    in discussions about those pages, in conceptual

12    discussions as to what approach might be taken with

13    respect to those pages.  And I was involved in

14    drafting examples of pages for the consideration of lb        the business executives whose website the

16    responsibility was and also in editing those pages

17    as they went through a consultative process.

16       Q.    Did you have a formal responsibility

19    with respect to your work --

20               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection-

21         Q.     with the website pages?

22               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23        A.    Could you help me with "formal" 

24    what you mean by "formrl responsibility."

2    example, with respect to the development, tho

3    drafting and development of the content on the

4    tobacco issues section of the Philip Morris USA

5    website?

6        A.    I think I did play that role.  Not in

7    any kind of formal  I was never appointed

8    anything, there was never any kind of organization

9   announcement.  I was never sent a memo that said,

10    from now on you are to play such and such a role.

11    I think it was all done through the creation cf a

12    task force, and I functioned on that task force and

13    played a role similar to what you've described.

14         Q.    Did that task force have a name?

15         A.   Well, I always refer to it as the

16    website task force.  There may have been a more

17    formal name for it, such as the strategic task

18    force or the strategic issues task force, but its

19    principal  at the time that the website was being

20    developed, really, the only thing that it focused

21    on was getting the website published.

22         Q.    Was that a task force that convened

23   meetings?

24         A.    Yes, there were meetings of the task 2b        force, sure.

2   on the web site on October 13th, 1999, is that what:

3   you mean by initial 

4        Q.   When the website was launched on October !:>       13, 1999, there was a section on, on the tobacco

6   issues section; is that correct?

7        A.    Yes.

8        Q.   There was a section on the health

9   effects of smoking; is that correct?

10        A.    Yes.

11        Q.   Did you have  who else besides

12   yourself had input into the language stated in that

13   section?

14        A.    First and foremost was the website task

15   force that I referred to, which consisted of a

16   number of senior company executives from both --

\1       from each of Philip Morris Management Corp., Philip

18   Morris USA, Philip Morris International.  So the

19   task force had input and final approval, if you

20   will.  But they were responsible for the website

21   content.

22             There were other people who looked at

23   it, a lot of other people who looked at it in the

24   course of its development.  It would be very hard

25   to try to come up with a complete list, but it was

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=389
Page 200

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   extensively reviewed both by executives within the

3   various tobacco companies and PMMC, as well as

4   outside counsel.

5        Q.   Can ycu identify for me members of the

6   strategic issue task force other than Denise Keane?

7        A.    Yes.  I'll try to be as complete as I

8   can.  There was Ellen Merlo from Philip Morris USA,

9   there was David Dangor from Philip Morris

10   International, there was Owen Smith from Philip

11   Morris International, there was David Greenberg

12   from PMMC, David Nicoli from PMMC, Victor Han from

13   PMMC, Steve Krigbaum from PMMC legal.  Clare

14   Purcell wound up being on the task force, she's

15   from PMMC.  In terms of members of the task force,

16   I guess I would include myself, although I was not

17    initially a member, but I was invited to join after

18   a point.

19             I think that's basically a list of the

20   core members.  I think there were probably others,

21   but those are the ones that are coming to mind

22   right now.

23        Q.    Who at Philip Morris ultimately approved

24   the language to be posted on the website?

25        A.    It was ultimately approved by the task

2   force with the advice and counsel not only of the

3   lawyers on the task force but of other lawyers at

4   PMMC.

5        Q.   Was Denise Keane the most senior person

6   who reviewed the text of the statement on causation

7   on the website?

8        A.    No.

9        Q.    Who was the most senior person who

10   reviewed the causation statement?

11        A.   Well, keep in mind, as indicated earlier

12   this morning, Denise was associate general counsel

13   of worldwide regulatory affairs Philip Morris

14   Companies.  In terms of seniority in the legal

15   department, the most senior person would have been

16   Murray Bring, who at the time was the general \1     counsel.

18        Q.    Did he review the causation language

19   before it was posted on the website?

2 0       A.    My recollection is that he reviewed that.

21   section, yes,

22        Q.    Did anyone  who does Mr. Bring report

23   to?

24        A.         As the general counsel, at the time he

25   would have reported to Mr. Bible, the chairman and

2   CEO.

3        Q.   Did Mr. Bible review the causation

4   language before it was posted on the website?

5        A.    My underst<mding was that he did review        it or that it was shown to him before we published, 1       but I did not have any personal interaction with

8   him regarding his review.

9        Q.    Do you know whether  which senior

10   executives on the task force had specific

11   involvement in preparing the causation statement?

12             MR. FREDERICK;  Objection.

13        A. '  Well, again, in terms of involvement,

14   the whole task -- the drafts were ultimately

1!)       distributed to everyone on the task force, so they

16   were all involved, everyone discussed it together.

17   So I would say that there was involvement by the

IB       entire task force as well as others who were not on

19   the task force.

20        Q.    Why were you invited to participate in

21   the activities of the task force?

22             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23        A.    To answer that, I can only give you my

24   personal beliefs about that,  I was never -- when I

25   was invited to do it, I was never sat down and said

2    here's why we are asking you to do this.  But I

3    know that I was brought in because of my

A        experience, substantive content knowledge with

5    respect to the very issues that were to be  that

6    the task force had previously decided were to be

7    subject matters to be dealt with on the tobacco

8    issues pages.  I believe I was brought in because

9    of my legal experience dealing with issues of

10    communication of tobacco specific issues.  I

11    believe I was brought in because of my experience 1.2        with the Hatch statement and the application of the

13    Hatch statement to practical situations and how the

14    company could stay in compliance with the Hatch

15    statement.  And I was  I believe I was brought: in

16    because there was a perception that I had some

17    decent drafting abilities.

18         Q.   Who invited you to join the task force?

19         A.   Denise Keane.

20         Q.    Do you know who Mike Szymanczyk is?

21         A.    Yes.

22         Q.    Who is Mr. Szymanczyk?

23         A.    At the time he was chairman and CE10 oi

24    Philip Morris USA.  That's what he was at the time.

4        Q.    Who is the CEO now?

5        A.    Jack Nelson.

7   Language before it was posted on the website?

8             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

9        A.   I don't know whether he did or not.

10   The Philip Morris USA representative on the task

11   force was Ellen Merlo, it was her responsibility as

12   that representative to take responsibility for

13   Philip Morris USA's input, and I don't know what

14   process she followed in terms of review and

15   consultation within Philip Morris.

16        Q.   You indicated earlier that your

17   involvement with the Hatch statement  with the

18   creation of the Hatch statement was tangential; is

19   that correct?

2 0       A.    Yes.

21        Q.   Can you describe what you mean by

22   "tangential"?

23        A.    I think I may have said extremely

24   tangential, because in terms of actually developing 26       the writing or the drafting of what the Hatch

2    statement turned out to be, my involvement was

3    limited to having been shown a draft or two of it

4    at the very late stages of its development and f)        perhaps asked to comment, but it may have been 6        almost more of just showing it to me for my

1        information so I know what was going on.

8               I had a much greater involvement after

9    the Hatch statement had already been submitted to 10        Senator Hatch and had already been announced as

] 1        company policy.  There; was a lot of application of

12    it, opportunities to apply it in the lobbying

13    effort in favor of the proposed resolution, and

14    then against the McCain bill going forward there

1 b        was constantly the need to apply it.  It was part

16    of the testimony that Mr. Bible gave which I was

17    involved to some degree.  And so all the, kind of

18    the follow-up work involved a lot of application of

19    the Hatch statement, as well my work in WRA, my

20    general responsibilities both in the United States

21    and internationally involved, if you will, the

22    education of and carrying forward of the Hatch

23    statement to corporate affairs executives who might

24    not have had a perfect understanding of what was

25    meant by it, because it affected the behaviors of

2    the company in certain specific practical ways.  So

3    1 may even have been asked to conduct briefings or

4    training sessions where we would go through with

5   different corporate affairs professionals and give

6   them a chance to ask questions about it and make

7    sure that everybody was briefed up on it and could 9        comply with it, both in its letter and its spirit. 9        So I became someone who had simply worked a lot

10    with the statement and with figuring out how to

11    apply it to everyday business matters or regulatory

12   matters in its aftermath.

3 3        Q.    Do you know whether Steve Parrish

3.4        reviewed the content of the causation statement

20         A.    Yes.

21         Q.    Who?

22        A.   As I indicated, it was reviewed by PMMC 2 3        lawyers who were not on the task force, including

24    Mr. Bring, and it was reviewed by a number of

25   different outside counsel.

2         Q.    The language originally posted on

3    causation on the website is not identical to that

4    of the Hatch statement; is that correct?

5         A.    Yes, that's quite correct.

6         Q.    Can you explain why the decision was

7   made to depart from the language of the Hatch

8    statement on the originally posted website section

9   on causation?

10               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

11         A.    It having been a group consensus

12    project and ultimately approved by a lot of

13   different people, what I can do is give you --

14    there's no official reason sitting out there, but I

15    have a point of view on it and belief about it that

16    I can give in response.

17               The statement, the causation statement

18    as it appeared on October 13, 1999, the idea was

19    not to simply replicate the Hatch statement.  What

20    that website statement was was, in effect, a

21    fulfillment of the Harch statement.  It was an

22    implementation and a further effort on the part of

23    the company to comply with the Hatch statement.

24               The Hatch statement said that, with

25    respect to primary causation, which I gather is

2    what we are discussing right now, that the

3    companies would refrain from public debate on the

4    subject and would support a single consistent

5    health message, so that was basically a policy

8    issue statements that were inconsistent with the

9    public health messages, that's what supporting a

10    single public health message meant, but. it would

11    have been possible to be in compliance with the

12    Hatch statement and simply to have said nothing.

13    There would have been no need -- one -- the

14    companies could have decided not to have any

1!)         statement on their website dealing with causation,

16    and that still would have been in compliance with

17    the Hatch statement, because there would have been

18    nothing being said that did not support a single

19    consistent health message.  But the companies

2 0         wanted to do more than just do nothing, and they

21    wanted to proactively fulfill the spirit of the

22    Hatch statement and actively disseminate public

23    health messages in a way, and using the website

24    technology, which it se^ms like ages ago now, but 2b         still seemed kind of nev; back then, use the idea of

2    a website to assemble a real compendium of public

3    health information, put it on the site, put the

4    statements of the public health community on the

5   site, provide the links so that people could go

6   directly to the government reports and materials,

7    they could read it for themselves, there would be

8    no question about: that.  The only thing the company

9    is disseminating is public health information, and

10    that was one step beyond the Hatch statement.

11               A second step beyond the policies of the

12    Hatch statement was that the companies didn't just

13   put that information on the website and broadcast

14    it and publish it, they further made a further

15    statement that said they wanted smokers to rely

16    upon that information in terms of when they were

17    making any of their smoking-related decisions, IB        meaning to smoke/ not to smoke, to quit, not to

19    quit.  So I see the October '99 website as both a

20    fulfillment of and a carrying out of the letter and

21    the spirit of the policies announced in the Hatch

22    statement.

23         Q.    The October 13, 1999 website statement

24    on causation did not state Philip Morris' agreement

25   with the overwhelming medical and scientific

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    consensus that smoking causes a number of serious

3   diseases; is that correct?

4         A.    That is correct.  It did not state any

5   opinion by Philip Morris on the scientific issues

6   whatsoever.  Again, in fulfillment of the Hatch

7    statement, committed not to do anything but support

8    a consistent health message.

9        Q.    In October, in approximately October of

10    2000, the website changed; is that correct?

11         A.    Yes, it did.

12         Q.    And the statement on causation in the

13   website was changed to state Philip Morris*

14    agreement with the overwhelming and scientific

15    consensus; is that correct? 1(>       A.    That is correct.

17         Q.    When did Philip Morris decide to change

18    the content of the causation statement on the

19    website?

20               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

21         A.    I can't pinpoint for you a moment in

22    time when it -- a decision point was taken, but as

23    you indicated, the change was made sometime in

24    October 2000, so sort of on information and belief,

25    I think a decision was made shortly before that.

2         Q.   Were you involved in the redrafting of

3    the website statement on causation?

A                   A.    I was involved to some degree, yes.

5   There was not very much redrafting.  It was

6   essentially adding the words "we agree with" at the

7   beginning.  But I was involved with that project to

8    some degree.

9        Q.    Who else was involved in that project?

10        A.    To my knowledge, Steve Krigbaum was

11    involved, there was executives at the two tobacco

12    companies that were involved.  I did not deal with

13    any of them directly.  And there were others in the

14    Philip Morris PMMC legal department involved.

15         Q.    Do you know who made the decision to

16   change the content of the causation statement?

17         A.    I didn't witness it personally and was

18    not at the meeting, but my understanding is the

19    decision was made by the then CEOs of PM USA and PM

20    International, which would have been Mike

21    Szymanczyk and Paul Hendryss.

22         Q.    Do you know who else was at the meeting

23    when the decision to change the website was made? 2 A                     A.    No.

25       Q.    Do you know when the decision was made?

9             MR. GOLDFARB:  I'll reask the

10        question.

11        Q.    Do you know why Philip Morris made the

12   decision to change the content of the causation

13   statement on the website to state its agreement

14     that smoking causes serious diseases?

15                  MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.  Instruct the

16           witness not to answer to the extent the

17           answer would disclose privileged

18           information.

19                  There's a non-privileged component.

20        The witness may answer that portion, if you

21           would like him to do so.

22             MR. GOLDFARB:  Objection.

23        Q.   Please do so.

24        A.    So leaving aside the considerations that 2 5          relate to legal advice, my answer is yes, I believe

2    I do know the policy reasons or the non-privileged

3   reasons why PM USA and PMI decided to change the

4    site in that way.

5        Q.   What were those reasons  I'm sorry,

6   strike the question.

7               MR. GOLDFARB:  I want to interpose an

8         objection.

9        Q.    And now ask, please, what were those

10    reasons?

11         A.    Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris

12    International at that time adopted a new policy.

13    The policy that we had been talking about earlier

14    that was embodied in the Hatch statement was simply lb        to not to debate the public health comntunity or not

16    to debate the public health message, and if you

17    read the Hatch statement you'll see that it's

18    noted, you know, notwithstanding differences of

19    scientific views that we? may have on that subject,

20    The 1999 website, as I said, was a fulfillment of

21    that, because the company's scientific opinions

22.        were, and continue to be, that there were technical

23    issues and mechanism issues with respect to

24    causation of disease in smokers.  Had they stated 2b        those opinions on the website in 1999, it would

3990538437pgNbr=405

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   have violated the Hatch commitment to only support

3   a single consistent health message.

A                             What the companies -- and what I mean by

b       companies, I mean PM USA and PM International 

6   decided to do in 2000 was to adopt a policy that

7   says, that basically said we are not going to have

8   a science-based approach to causation anymore.  We

9   are deciding, as a matter of corporate policy, that

10   the most important thing for us to be doing is

11   communicating the same exact message on smoking and

12   health causation as the public health community.

13   So they decided as a matter of policy to agree and

14   to find the areas of agreement, which obviously has

15   to do with the very strong epidemiology that, you

16   know, links cigarette smoking to lung cancer, heart

17   disease and other diseases.  So they adopted a

18   policy that said we are going to agree with that as

19   a matter of policy, and that's what we are going to

20   communicate on our website.  So it's not just: that

21   we are communicating the public health message, we

22   are adopting the public health message as our own

23   message, in our own voice.

24        Q.    The legal rensons you refer to  you

25   referred to that exist, concerning why Philip

2   Morris made the decision to change, who was

3   involvea in articulating or communicating those

4   legal reasons?

b                 A.    Well, the people who would have been

6   involved in that would be Bill Ohlemeyer, who was

7   head of litigation, and Chuck Wall, who at that

8   time was the general counsel.  There may have been

9   others, I don't know.

10        Q.   When was that advice that the

11   communication claim  when did the communications

12   claimed as privileged occur involving Mr. Ohlemeyer

13   and -- did you say Mr. Wall?

14        A.    I guess I would add Mr. Krigbaum to that:

15   list.

16        Q_.   When did that communication occur?

17        A.    It would have been in the period right

18   before the, you know, shortly before the websites

19   were changed.

20        Q.   When you say "shortly," can you 

21        A.    In the weeks before,  I can't really

22   pinpoint it any more specifically than that.

23        Q.    And to whom was that communication

24   directed?

25        A.    I think I'm getting lost here, because

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=407
Ptige 21S

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2   we are not really talking about a communication.

3    You asked me what the reasons were, and my belief

A        is that some of those reasons were the ones that I

5   expressed to you, and some of those reasons relate

6   to a matter that I think or an issue that I believe

7    is privileged, after discussing with my counsel.

8    So it's not about a communication, it's about one

9   of the reasons was privileged  is privileged, and

10    so I guess discussions about that reason would have

11   been privileged.  And as far as I was aware of

12    those discussions, they occurred in that period.

13         Q.    I'm asking who else participated in

14    those discussions.

15        A.    Other than the ones I mentioned, nobody.

16   With me.  I mean, you know.

17         Q.    Were there meetings where Mr. Ohlemeyer,

18   Mr. Wall, Mr. Krigbaum discussed the legal reasons

19    for changing the website 

20               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

21.       Q.     with anyone else at Philip Morris?

22               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23         A.    I don't know.

24         Q.   Were there communications other than

25   meetings at which these three individuals

2    communicated the legal reasons for changing the

3   website?

4               MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

5        A.    I don't know what the -- I don't know

6   what their communications were, other than whatever

7   conversations I personally had with them.

8        Q.    Do you know whether they communicated

9   the legal reasons for changing the websiter tc

10    anyone other than you?

11         A.    I don't know.

12         Q.   You made reference to a change in

13    corporate policy to make the position of the public

14    health community on causation that of Philip

15   Morris; is that correct?

16        A.    Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris

17    International, yes.

18         Q.    Was that a formal change in corporate

19    policy?

20         A.    It was a clearly articulated change in

21    corporate policy, and it was articulated  yesr I

22    think it was explicitly or expressly articulated.

23         Q.    Was it articulated in writing?

24         A.    Yes, I believe so.

25         Q.    Who communicated the writing?

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2         A.    The writing that I have in mind is a

3   document that was issued to executives and

4    corporate affairs professionals in PM USA, PM

5    International and probably to some extent PMMC

6    people who supported those companies at the time of

7    the website change, that explained the change and

8    explained the reasons for the change.

9         Q.   And you also said that, in referring to

10    the policy, you used the word "they," to say they

11    made a decision or they referred to the corporate

12    policy.  Who are you referring to?

13        A.    "They," referring to PM USA arid PM

14    International,

15         Q.    When was that change in corporate policy

16    made?

17         A.    It was articulated in conjunction with

18    the website change.  The website changed and this

19    document was circulated either at or about the same

20    time internally.

21         Q.    Do you know if the decision  do you

22    know when the decision to change corporate policy

23    occurred?

24         A.    Again, without trying to pinpoint it to

25    an exact moment in time, I think it was all wrapped

2    together.  I think the decision to change the

3   wording on the website was part and parcel to a

4    decision to adopt a policy to communicate and --

5    agree  to communicate agreement with the public

6    health positions.  I don't think you would have had

7    one without the other.  And indeed, if you just

8    look at it logically, the policy decision had t.o

9    have been made before the website  the website

10    change was an implementation of the policy

11    decision.

12         Q.    Do you know whether it was  did you

13    first learn of the existence of the new corporate

14    policy upon receiving the memo in October of 2000?

15        A.    No.  I learned about it before that.

16         Q.    How long  can you articulate or

17    estimate how long before the website was changed or

18    how long before you received this communication,

19    that you learned that the corporate policy had

20    changed?

21         A.   A couple weeks beforehand.

22         Q.    How did you learn about this change in

23    policy at that time?

24         A.    I was informed that the CEOs had agreed

25    to change their policy between themselves, by Stevn

2        Krigbaum.

3        Q.    We have been discussing the causation

4   section of the tobacco issues portion of the Philip b       Morris USA website.

6        A.    Right.

7        Q.    Did the development of the addiction

8   portion of the tobacco issues page proceed the

9   same, sort of along the same course as  the

10   causation page  excuse me, the causation section?

11             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

12        A.   They were changed concurrently.  It's

13   not really the same issue exactly.  The wording was

14   changed, because the addiction language at that

15   time was also changed to say we agree with the

16   consensus that cigarette smoking is addictive, so

17   that policy change that was adopted at that time IB       also applied to the addiction issue.

19             But when I say it is somewhat different,

20   I say that because the 1999 version of the website

21   had a statement in the company's own voice.  It had

22   already said, with the company speaking in its own

23   voice, smoking is addictiver   and I think the

24   wording in 1999 was smoking is addictive as that

25   term is most commonly used today.  That, was the

lisquirc Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=412
Page 223

Berlind - Confidential

2   voice of the company talking.  And just as in the

3   Hatch statement, the company said that under some

A       definitions smoking is addictive, cigarette smoking

b       is addictive.  So the company was already

6   expressing a point of view on addiction that was

7   pretty much in lock step with the public health

8   community, maybe with a tweak or two.  Once the

9   policy was adopted, it became sort of a simple

10   matter to just change that wording to conform it or

11   make it consistent with the new causation wording.

12        Q.    Was the addiction language circulated to

13   the same people to whom the causation language was H       circulated?

15        A.         When you say "language," of which site

16   and during which period of time?

17        Q.    Was the addiction language as it

18   appeared originally in October 1999 circulated to

19   the same people to whom the causation statement had

20   been circulated prior to the website launch?

21        A.    Yes.  In fact, as they were -- as they

22   appear on the same page of the website, my

23   recollection is they appeared on the same pages of

24     draft website pages, so everyone who got one got: 2i>          the other.

1                Berlind - Confidential

2        Q.   Were you involved at all in the

3   development of the addiction section of that

A       tobacco issues page, as it was changed in October

b       of 2000?

6        A.    To the same degree that I mentioned

7   having been involved in the other one, yes, I'd say 3       exactly to the same degree.  It was the same

9       discussion, really.  They weren't separated out.

10        Q.    Did you personally redraft the web page?

11        A.    I don't recall ever sitting down and

12   being asked to redraft it.  As I think I indicated .13       earlier, the drafting was simply adding "we agree"

14   to the beginning-  If that was causation, addiction

15   involved slightly more drafting, but nothing more

16   complicated.  So I may have reviewed a draft.  I

17   just don't really remember focusing very much or

18   seeing or discussing very much the actual language.

19   That was  the language was pretty self-evident,

20   once the policy change was effected.

21        Q.   Was  do you know whether Mr. Bible

22   reviewed the changes ~o the causation and addiction

23   statements on the Philip Morris website, before

24   they were posted in October of 2000?

25        A.    I don't know if he did or not.

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2         Q.    Do you know if he participated in the

3   decision to change the corporate policy?

4         A.   As I had said, my understanding was that

5   the decision-makers were Messrs. Szymanczyk and

6   Hendryss.  Whether they consulted with anyone else,

7    1 don't know.

8         Q.    Do you know whether Mr. Parrish was

9   shown a copy of the redrafted causation and

10    addiction statements, before they were posted on

11    the website in October 2000?

12         A.    I don't know for a fact whether he was

13    or not.

14         Q.    Do you know whether he participated in

15    the meetings that led to the change in corporate

16    policy?

17         A.    I don't know what meetings he did or did

18    not participate in, but I do recall discussing the

19    changed policy with him and discussing what

20   questions people might have about it or what issues

21   might arise from it that corporate affairs clients

22    might want to deal with.

23         Q.    Do you know who was present at the

24    meeting at which Mr. Hendryss and Mr. Szymanczyk

25    made the decision to change the corporate policy,

2   to make the position of the public health community

3   on causation and addiction that of Philip Morris as

4   well?

5             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

6        A.    No.  Other than those two, I don't

7   know who was there.

8        Q.    Have you been involved in the

9   development of Philip Morris* website statements

10   regarding side strean. smoke or environmental

11   tobacco smoke?

1.2       A.    Yes.  I mean, now I'm back in 1999,

13   talking about 1999.  That was one of the original

14   tobacco issues pages.  I was involved in that to

15   the same degree that I described earlier for the

16   other pages.

17        Q.    Has the causation statement undergone

18   changes, other than the one made in October of

19   2000?

20        A.    I don't think so.

21             There's a very sort of technical change

22   that I think I'm aware of.  The original page in

23   1999 had a link in it to a WHO statement, I think 2A        it was under addiction, and they changed their

25       website around at one point.  The link became

3390538448pgNbr=416
Page 227

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   inoperative, so we had to identify another Link to .3       substitute, but I don't think the wording, other

A       than that change that you've been discussing in

5   October 2 000, I don't think there was any other

6   changes.

7        Q.    Has the addiction language on the page

8   changed more than  other than the change made in

9   October of 2000?

10        A.   No, I don't think it has.

11        Q.   How many changes have been made to the

12   statement on side stream smoke on the website since

13   the website was launched in October of 1999? 1-4                             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

15)       A.    Well, can we call it secondhand smoke,

1(>       because that's what the web  page is about.  1 don't

17   think the word "side stream smoke" appears on that

18   site.  Anyway, I know it's called secondhand smoke.

19             What was the question, how many times

20   has   it been changed?

21        Q.    How many times since the launch of the

22   website in October 1999 has the ETS language been

23   changed?

24        A.    If we can put aside changes to some of 2b       the links, because I think those occurred

2   infrequently but sometimes throughout the period,

3   in terms of the text, I'm aware of it having been

4   changed twice.

5        Q.   Can you describe the first change?

6        A.   Yes.  The first change occurred sometime

7   in 2C00.  I don't know precisely what the date was.

8   And it was a change that there was a sentence in

9   the original 1999 website that was the introductory 10       sentence to the section on scientific reports,

U       where it basically said, below are some reports

12   from the scientific community about secondhand

13   smoke, and it linked out to those reports.

14             The original site said something to the

15   effect of we don't agree with everything in these

16   reports, but we are providing them to you so you

17   can have access   to all the information.  Sometime

18   in 2000 a change was made to take out: the part

19   about we don't agree with it, so it was just left

20   with here's the report so that you can have access.

21   That was that change.

22        Q.   And you said that occurred sometime in

23   2000?

24        A.    Yes.

2b                 Q.    Was that prior to October of 2000?

2                    A.          Yes.

3        Q.   What was the next change that you are

4   aware of?

b                A.    The second change occurred just

6   recently, meaning in the last month or two.  And

7   that was a pretty much a revamp, an updating ol: the

8   entire ETS site, and there were a lot of changes

9   made to it, a lot of changes.

10        Q.    Is Philip Morris currently contemplating

11   further changes to the ETS portion of the website?

12        A.   Not that I'm aware of.

13             MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's go to number 6.

14              (Berlind Exhibit 8, copy of second 1.)       revised Philip Morris USA website page on

16        secondhand smoke, marked for identification,

17        as of this date.)

18        Q.    Please take a moment to look at it.  Let:

19   me know when you've had a chance to look at it. 3 have looked at it. Have you seen this document before? Yes.

What is this document? This is the revised, second revised

Page 230

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2        Q.          Can you describe what information in the

3    text portion of the page is different in the last

4    month  I'm sorry, the change that you indicated

5   occurred in the last month?

6        A.   The last month or two.

7               Yes, the  I guess one major change,

8    just to get it out of the way, because it accounts

9    for a whole ton of changes, but in the original

10    site from 1999, the health portions of the

11    secondhand smoke site and the regulatory portions,

12    in other words, the portions of the site that talk

13    about the company's support of reasonable smoking

14    restrictions in public places and the company's lb        support of the idea that non-smokers should not

16    have to be exposed to secondhand smoke, if they

17    don't want to be, both the regulatory and the

18    health sections previously appeared together on the

19    same page.

20               They have been split up now.  The

21    regulatory information still appears on the

22    website, but it's under a different category.  So

23   one big change is that it was streamlined, the

24    health section was streamlined and made to look

25   much more in the style of the health issues for

Iisquirc Deposition Services i-800-944-9454pgNbr=420
Page 231

1                     Berlind - Confidential

2    smokers' page, the causation and addiction page,

3    where it's just a very simple recitation of the

4    government conclusions of the health effects

5    followed by the links.  That represents another

6    change.

7                 The second change now, turning to that

8    health section, it starts off I think pretty much

9    the way the old one does, public health officials

10    talking about what they have concluded.  I think

11    the list of diseases is probably longer. I

12    remember the first one talking about lung cancer

13    and heart disease.  This one also talks about: a

14    bunch of other conditions, including children's lf>         conditions which were mentioned on the earlier

16    site.  So it's organized a bit differently, but

17    there's a statement up front about what diseases

18    the public health officials have concluded.

19                 There's a statement which is new for the

20   website but existing -- reflecting existing company

21    policy from the Hatch statement, saying that

22    that  essentially that the PM USA is deferring to 2 3         the federal government: in terms of what any

24    required messages ought to be, the text for the

25    required messages for secondhand smoke, so that's

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=421
Page 232

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    new in terms of being on this site.

3               The links have been updated to a certain

4    degree.  I think the World Health Organization link

5    is new, the U.S. National Toxicology Program link

6    is new, the Institute of Medicine's asthma report

7    is clearly new.  So there was a general updating of

8    material there.

9               And then, finally, I would say that

10        there were in the health section, previously there

13        were some other links to some other kinds of

12    material, not government, reports, but there were

13    some links to some articles that were critical of

14    low epidemiology science.  Those were removed.  And

15    there was a link to Judge Osteen's opinion from the

16    EPA risk assessment case that has been removed, and

17    there was a small section dealing with exposure

18    levels to secondhand smoke that has also been

19    removed.  So I would say those are the principal

20    changes.

21         Q.    Do you know who made the decision to

22    change the text of the ETS website, this ETS

23    portion of the website?

24         A.    Yes.  The decision was made again by the

25    heads of the businesses, of PM USA and PM

2    International.

3        0.    Would that be now Mr. Nelson and

4    Mr. Hendryss?

5        A.    Well, the decision was made at the time

6    that Mr- Szymanczyk was still president and CEO of

7    PM USA, and Mr. Nelson at that time was president

8    and CEO of PMI, so it was Mr. Szymanczyk and

9   Mr. Nelson.

10         Q.   The web page that's marked as Berlind

11    Exhibit 8 does not indicate that Philip Morris'

12    position is that of the public health community on

13    the issue of secondhand smoke; is that correct?

14         A.    That is correct.

15         Q.    Is there a reason why the corporate

16    policy that was announced in approximately October

17    of 2000 to make the causation and addiction

IB        position of Philip Morris that  those of the

19    public health community not extended to secondhand

20    smoke?

21         A.   Yes.  I want to say, first and foremost,

22    it was clear when those policies were articulated

23    that they only applied to causation and addiction.

24    There was never any such policy announced for

25    secondhand smoke.  And the fact that this website

Esquire Deposition Services 1.800-944-9454pgNbr=423
Page 234

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   doesn't indicate the company's agreement with those

3   public health conclusions, it's consistent with

4   that policy only including -- applying to those b       other issues.

6        Q.    Why has Philip Morris not made its

7   position on secondhand smoke that of the public

8   health community?

9             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

10       A.    My answer is going to be qualified by,

13       you know, the fact that I was involved in this

12   project and I advised with respect to it, including

13   providing legal advice.  But the decision was not

14   mine and so the reason and  so the reasons are

15   not miner but I'm aware of the thinking and the

16   discussions that went on and I believe is the

17   correct explanation.

13                             And there are a number of reasons.  The

19   science with respect to ETS is significantly

20   different for secondhand smoke than it is with

21   respect to active smoking.  And the company did

22   not  the company did not -- the companies PM USA

23   and PMI did not want to take the step of saying

24   they agree with that, 7  sense, and that they agree

25   with the public health officials, when their

'?.        scientists continue to have serious questions about

3    that material.

4               However, the companies likewise decided b        that they wanted to have a public communications

6   program and a website where they were only

7    communicating the public health messages.  The

8    companies have taken a pretty clear decision that

9    notwithstanding the technical and scientific issues 10          that they see with the science, they think the

L]          right approach for them is to only communicate and

12    disseminate the public health positions and that's

13    what they are doing.  So there is a somewhat

14    different, you know, in answer to your question l!:i        further, it is different: in the sense that they

16    don't explicitly say they agree, but the practical

17    effect of what they are doing is really the same 13         thing.  They are disseminating that message ar.d 19        only that message, which is why they took out the 2 0         links that I mentioned earlier to the materials

21    that were critical of the science and critical of

22    some of the conclusions that had been reached.

23    They decided that they wanted to send a very clean

24    message that is only the public health message,

25    notwithstanding their own internal opinions.

2          Q.    Do you continue to be involved in

3    coordinating Philip Morris' consideration of sort

4    of ongoing changes to the website?

b                      A.    Not in any kind of formal way.  There's

6    no website committee anymore, there's no task

7    force.  Changes that have come along, including

8    this recent one to the secondhand smoke page, have

9    been more the result of ad hoc discussions between

10    the different business units and the different

11    client groups, and in this case involved client.

12    groups from PM USA, PM International and also

13    corporate corporate affairs, who had an interest in

14    changing the site or discussing a change of the 11)          site.  And so I was pulled into it on that basis. 16                                     As we have established through this

IV         discussion, the changes have not been that

18    frequent, so I can't say what will happen with

19    respect to future changes.  I don't have any formal

20   website maintenance role.  The sites are being

21    maintained by Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris

22     International.

23          Q.    Have you done any work with the youth

24    smoking prevention department during your time at 2f>         Philip Morris?

2        A.    They have never been a client of mine.

3    I have never done any legal work for them.  I have h        never provided any really  I have never worked

5   with them at all.  There have been times when I

6   have been in meetings when someone from the YSP

7    group was there, but no, I have not had any role

8   with respect to PM USA's YSP department.

9        Q,          Have you communicated with persons in

10    the youth smoking prevention department on matters

11    of youth smoking?

12         A.    Well, certainly in connection with the

13   development of the tobacco issues pages for the

14    website there was a  there is and was a youth

15    smoking prevention page; and if my memory is

16    correct, that page was under development at a time

17    when the YSP department was already in existence.

18    I think that was set up previous to that.  So

19    clearly I would have been liaising with them, in

20    some way in soliciting their views, in terms of the

21    content of that page.

22               There have been miscellaneous kind of

23    e-mails and communications on  I mean typical 2A        kinds of things I remember, which aren't very

25        specific, are if some article comes up or something

2    that seems interesting, and I would  sometimes I

3   tend to circulate things to people, sometimes 1

4    would put someone from the Y5P department on a

b        circulation list, but I never was engaged in any

6    sort of ongoing work with them.

7         Q.    Have you participated in any drafting or

8   development of materials produced for the youth

10        A.    No.

11         Q.    Have you reviewed drafts of such 3 2        materials?

14       Q.   Are you aware that the Philip Morris

lb        website now contains a link to a brochure

1 6        concerning adult discussions with children on youth 17        smoking?

3 8       A.    I have heard of that brochure.  I don't

3 9        think that I was aware that they put a link up on

20    the website.

'1       Q.    Is Mr. Harris a lawyer?

5       A.    Not that I'm aware of.

(>       Q.    What was the nature of the advice or

7    work that they did for  in connection with the

8    website development project  the website task

9    force, as you've referred to it?

10          A.    They were retained and were really key

11    members, and I would identify two principal things

12    that they did, the second one really being just.

13    Lindheim, not both of them.

14                  But both of them were there, from a lb         communications perspective, to advise the task

16    force and advise Denise about the content of the

17    website.  Not from a content perspective, in terms

18    of what should the company's position be, they

19    weren't the decision-makers on that or, you know,

20    in any sense even having a vote necessarily.  But

21    whatever the company's positions were going to be,

22    it was their job to make sure or help us make sure 2 3         that they were effectively and clearly communicated 2 4         and articulated in a website format, and they were

2 5        advising the task force and Denise on sort of the

2   website communications aspect of it.  If we are

3   going to do a website, might as well do one people

A       are going to pay attention to, are going to clearly

b       get the messages you are trying to communicate.  So

6   they were there, both of them, from that

7   perspective, from the clarity perspective, from the

8   effectiveness of communication perspective.

9             In addition to that, Lindheim -- and

10   this memo is shot through with this  had an

11   important role as kind of the facilitator of the

12   task force.  He was the one who kept the schedule,

13   who had a matrix going, in terms of week one, week

14   two, week five, how are you going to get out to

15   October and have a completed website.  So he was

16   the process person that really was responsible for,

17   was helping Denise, keeping the whole project

18   moving along and moving on time.

19        Q.   Was Denise Keane the head of the website

20   task force?

21        A.    Yes.

22        Q.    Is that task force a different task

23   force than what I think you referred to earlier as

24   strategic issues?

25        A.    No.  My apologies.  It's one in the

2   same.     I have just gotten used to calling it the

3   website task force.

4        Q.    There's a reference in the section

5   marked paragraph one that statesf   quote,   "We have

6   tried very hard to learn from the B&W focus groups

7   about what kinds of things people want from a

8   website."

9             To what is Mr. Lindheim referring to,

10   when he talks about B&W focus groups?

11             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

12        A.    Prior to the establishment of the

13   website task force Brown & Williamson had launched

14   their own website, I forget when, but it was early lb       1999, let's say.  And that website had a number of

16   features, but among other things, it had a bunch of

17   discussions of smoking and health or tobacco

18   issues.  So one of the things, one of the

19   activities that was undertaken by Denise's website

20   task force or strategic issues task force, in

21   connection with them trying to figure out what kind

22   of website they wanted to recommend for Philip

23   Morris Companies and PM USA and PM International to

24   do, was they went out and put together some focus

25   groups through a, you know, focus group consultancy

2    and tried to get reactions, what people's, real

3   people's reactions were to the B&W effort.  And

4    that's alluded to here in Lindheim's note.

5               And his reference, for example, to a

6    bunch of position papers I remember very well,

7    because the approach that B&W took on their site is i)       much more what I would call, and maybe only me, but 9        I thought of it as a much more traditional kind of

10    tobacco company approach, where there were these

11    kind of long, argumentative discussions with each

12    issue, where they would present perhaps another

13    point of view but then go to great lengths to

14    explain and advocate why they were right and why --l!!i         for example, there was a lengthy discussion on the

16    Brown  Williamson site about causation and the

17    mechanism of disease, what causes  you know, the

18   mechanism by what disease is caused not being known

19    and why that was important.  And on the other hand,

20    you have epidemiology, kind of went on and on and 2 ]        on.

22               And what Jim was advocating here is

23    that's not what people want from a website.  That's 2A        what he learned from the focus groups.  They want 25        short, punchy, bullet point messages that are

2    easily digestible.  I think his view was that

3    people, particularly surfing the web, tend to have

4    a short attention span, and they just want to sort

'>         of get it, click to something else and move on.  So

6         that's the kind of advice that he was advocating

1         here, which was completely in line with the role

i]          that I described to you of why he was retained. 9       Q.    Do you know whether anyone at -- I'm

10    sorry, did I interrupt you?

11           A.    No.

12           Q.    Do you know whether anyone at Philip

13    Morris had any contact with anyone at B&W about

14     their website, during the course of the deveAopinent I'i         of the Philip Morris website?

16          A.   During the development of the PM USA

17    website, certainly none that I'm aware of.  It's a

18    very big company.  I can't speak for everyone, but

19   I'd be  as far as I know, no.

20        Q.   Do you know whether anyone on the

21    website development or the website task force had

22   any contact with anyone at Brown & Williamson, 2 3         during the course of the Philip Morris website

24    development, on issues pertaining to the website?

25        A.    Thank you, that makes it easier.

2             I think there was one thing, I just

3   don't remember what the time frame was and I

A       presume that it was BSW, because I think: they were

!>       the only company with a website up, but I do

6   remember a discussion where somebody contacted them

7   with respect to their e-mail feature.  They had a

8   feature on their site where you could e-mail them

9   and give, you know, give them comments and ask for

10   comments back.  And I know that PM USA and PMI were

11   considering whether to have such an e-mail funcLion 1.2       and they were interested in the amount of traffic

13   that you actually get when you set that up, because

14    if it was going to be 20,000 e-mails a day that had

15   to be responded to, that implied some staffing

16   needs that they weren't sure they were prepared to

17   deal with.  So I have a recollection of someone

18   having contacted them with respect to that.

19        Q.    Did  was Mr. Lindheim's input into the

20   website development exclusively communications

21   related?

22             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23        A.    I would say yes, broadly speaking.

24             I mean Mr. lindheim was really the one,

25   and you can also  it is illustrated here, but he

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=436
Page 247

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    was the one who advocated very hard and very strong

3    for the ultimate format we developed,, which was

A        the, you know, paragraph, bullet point, paragraph,

h        bullet point, link, bullet point, link, bullet

6   point.  He also made a number of language

7    suggestions as the drafts were being developed,

8    although kind of fewer and fewer as the process

9   went on.

10               He wanted to make sure, to the extent

11    possible, and the intention was that they can be

12    complicated issues, and especially if you get into

13    science or policy, it's hard, but he wanted very

14    crisp sentences.  As you see here in this note, he

15    was very much against the "we believe" kind of

1(3        sentences.  He considered that to be a big turnoff

17    to the audience.  Who cares what you guys believe?

18    He kept telling us we believe that, we believe

19    that.  People want to know information.

20               So to that degree, you know, you can

21    hopefully hear, as I'm going through it, that kind

22    of advice and advocacy from him helped change the

23    point of what the whole website was about.  And 1 2 4        would put that out, the communications ambit, he 2b        didn't try to tell us, for example, what our

2   position on causation ought to be.

3        Q.    When you say "advocacy," you don't mean

4   that he brought any kind of legal advice.

!:>       A.    I don't think he was a lawyer, unless he

6   is and I don't know about it.  He was not providing

7   legal advice to the task force.  What he was doing

8   was taking the information and, you know,

9   synthesizing it with the legal advice which he

10   heard from me and Denise and others and tryinq to

11   help us come up with what he would consider to be

12   an effective website page.

13        Q.   How, if at all, did Mr. Harris' role

14   differ?

15        A.    I think with respect to the

16   communications, what I would call communications

17   effectiveness, he really played the same role.  He

18   and Jim, I mean it was two different perspectives

19   for the same purpose.  Jim might consider one way

20   of going at it to be good, Peter might consider it

21   differently, that's why they were both there.  But

22   his role was the same on effectiveness, and he did

23   not play Jim's role of the facilitation of the

24   process.  So I would say, you know, he was to that

25   degree, you know, less involved.

3    Morris indicated  strike the question.

4              Other than on its website, has Philip

5    Morris communicated its agreement that smoking

6   causes disease and that smoking is addictive --1                                      MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

8           Q.     via other means of communication?

9                  MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

10          A.    Speaking as to Philip Morris USA, the

11    answer to that is ye^s .  They engaged in a very

12    extensive and expensive project sometime in the

13    year 2000 of taking the website materials and

14     transporting them onto printed brochures, same

15    exact language, it was in a pamphlet, kind of

16    tri-fold, tri-color pamphlet style, and packet of

17     this material was mailed out to their entire

18    database of adult smokers.  They wanted to

19    communicate the messages that way to those people

20    in case people had not gone on the website.  So

21    that was one instance or one example that comes

22   very much to mind.

2 3                                       Another example is in regulatory

24     submissions such as the one that PM USA and PMI

25    jointly made to the WHO in support of a framework

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

2   convention on tobacco control, that position is

3   stated there in that submission.  It's stated, it's

4   probably stated in every regulatory commission that

5   I can think of, since those websites were

6   established.  It is communicated  that message is

7   communicated in public speeches.  When company

8   executives go out as they do to engage with

9   audiences across the countryr those messages are 

10   at least in the speeches I have seen, they are in

11   those speeches.  So it's communicated that way.  It

12   is communicated in the press when people give

13   interviews.  It's part of the whole lexicon, it's

14   part of the whole culture.  Every way they

15   basically have of  every way in which they

16   currently communicate with the public, those 1.7       messages tend to make their way in.

18        Q.    Has Philip Morris purchased ads in

19   newspapers to communicate its agreement with that

20   smoking causes disease and that smoking is

21   addictive?

22             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

23        A.   I'm not aware of any newspaper ad, nor

24   are they purchasing newspaper ads for their own

25   cigarette brands right now.

2        Q.   Has Philip Morris purchased newspaper

3   space to discuss other matters of corporate policy?

4             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

5        A.   Well, I'm going to switch now.  When

6   you say "Philip Morris," which entity do you mean?

7        Q.   Has either Philip Morris Companies or

8   Philip Morris USA paid for newspaper space where it

9   has communicated its position on matters of tobacco

10   policy or smoking policy?

11             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

12        A.    That's the same answer as last time.

13   I can't recall any such advertisements, nor do I 1-3       believe that Philip Morris USA is purchasing

15   newspaper space for cigarette advertisements right

16   now.  So it's not a form of media that they are

17   really in.

18             Philip Morris Companies has purchased an

19   ad that I'm aware of, but it doesn't relate

20   anything to tobacco.

21        Q.    Has Philip Morris purchased space in

22   newspapers to discuss the Master Settlement

23   Agreement?

24             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

25        A.    You've refreshed my recollection, I

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538473pgNbr=441

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    forgot about that campaign.  Philip Morris USA did

3    run newspaper ads, and -- I don't know if I'm

4    remembering this right or not  they may have run

5   TV ads relating to the Master Settlement Agreement.

6    I know they ran newspaper ads, and they may have

7    run TV ads, I can't recall.  I don't watch a lot of 3        TV.

9                               But X believe the newspaper ads were a

10        rotating series of ads that had different aspects

1.1        of the MSA, and I think there may have been some

12    communication of health issues in those ads, but I

13   would have to see the text of the ads.

14         Q.   The entity that purchased the space, did

15    you say, was Philip Morris USA?

1 f>                   A.    For the Master Settlement Agreement ads,

17        yes, those were PM USA ads.

IB       Q.    I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Do you know

19   whether Philip Morris USA has purchased advertising

20    space to discuss its agreement that smoking causes

21    disease and is addictive?

22        A,    I don't know that they have done that

23    other than to the extent that that message may have

24    been in or some allusic-i to that message may have

25   been in the MSA ads.  So that's all I know in terms

2   of newspaper ads .

3             I am aware ana won't be able to tell you

4   very much about it, because I'm not involved in it,

5   but I am aware currently that PM USA is considering

6   a campaign that would involve the discussion of

7   health issues, and I'm not sure what media or what

8   medium they are thinking about.

9        Q.    Do you know  sorry.

10        A.   That's really all I have heard.

11        Q.    Do you know whether Philip Morris

12   Companies or Philip Morris USA has run television

13   commercials discussing its agreement that smoking

14   causes disease and that smoking is addictive?

lb                 A.    Television commercials that have run to

16       date?

1.7       Q.    Has Philip Morris  yes, television

18   commercials that have run to date.

19        A.    I don't think there's been any such

20   television commercials so far.

21        Q.    Do you know whether television

22   commercials are planned that indicate Philip

23   Morris' agreement with 

24        A.   As  sorry.

25        Q.     with the statement that smoking

Page 254

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   causes disease and smoking is addictive?

3        A.    As I indicated, I have a fairly vague A       knowledge or an understanding that PM USA is

5   considering some kind of campaign, I don't know

6   whether it's TV or not, that would be explicitly

7   discussing that agreement.

8        Q.   Do you know who is responsible for this

9   developing or considering this potential campaign?

10        A.   My belief is that it would be Ellen

11   Merlo.

12        Q.   Do you know who else is involved in the

13   campaign you've described?

14        A.    No, no I don't know who is working on lb       it.

16        Q.   Did you say that the campaign would deal

17   with sort of tobacco or smoking and health issues? 1.8        A.    As I said, I heard -- my understanding

19   was that it was going to be a campaign that deals

20   with health issues, but I don't know what the

21   status of it is or if they are going to move

22   forward with it.  But I heard the campaign -- the

23   idea for a campaign or potential for a campaign ?A       being discussed.

2b                 Q.    Who did you hear that from?

2        A.    I heard Alan mention it at a meeting

'3        that must have been about other issues, because it

A        wasn't a meeting to discuss that campaign  that

5       potential campaign. 6       Q.    Do you know whether Philip Morris has

7    retained any contractors or outside consultants to

8    assist with the development of a campaign?

9        A.   No, other than what I have told you, I

10    don't know anything about it.

11         Q.    Has Philip Morris tested the messages it.

12    has posted on the website on smoking and health

13    issues in focus groups?

14         A.    In the summer of 1999, prior to the

15    launch of the original website, focus cjroups were

16   undertaken to test consumer reaction to the

17    language as it stood at that timer which was, if I

18    remember correctly, pretty similar to the final

19    versions that went out.

20         Q.    Do you know whether focus group testings

21    occurred on the content of Philip Morris1 website

22    on tobacco issues subsequent to its launch?

23        A.    I don't know.

24               If there was any such focus group

25    testing, it would have been conducted by Philip

2
	Morris USA
	and PMI, respectively.  They have their
	

3
	own internal folks who kind of work on that kind of
		

A
	stuff.
	
	

5
	Q.
	As someone who is involved in drafting
	

6
	and coordination as part of the website task force,
		

1
	would you have received -- would you receive data
		

8
	or reports
	from any such focus group testing?
	

9
	A.
	I saw the results of the focus group
	

10
	testing in
	1999, prior to the launch- of the site.
	

11
	Q.
	And had any been done subsequently,
	

12
	would you
	Likely have received data or analysis
	

13
	reports arising out of such subsequent testing?
		

14
	A.
	Not necessarily, not necessarily at all
	

15
	Q.
	Do you know who conducted the focus
	

16
	groups for
	Philip Morris?
	

17
	A.
	In 1999?
	

18
	Q.
	Yes.
	

19
	A.
	I would say, for Philip Morris
	

20
	Management
	Corp., and if I'm remembering it
	

21
	correctly,
	they would have been conducted by David
	

22
	Nicoli's group, which is the corporate corporate
		

23
	affairs group that has opinion polling capability.
		

2 4
	So I think
	it would have been that group.
	

25
	Q.
	Did it have opinion polling capability

Berlind - Confidential internal to Philip Morris?

A.    Yes, they have a couple people inside who used to do that externally and they kind of. manage the process.  Every poll that I have seen conducted for internal use has been they use a vendor, they use an external vendor to actually make the phone calls and tabulate the data.  When I refer to the opinion polling unit, it's the people who manage the vendors and figure out how to put together a useful polling tool or, in the case of your question, a focus group tool.

13"?

A. Q. A.

Have you ever heard of the term "Arden

Yes

To what does that refer?

The Arden 13, there is a professional development and educational course system or there's a series of courses that corporate affairs or corporate corporate affairs offers to its employees, to corporate affairs professionals offer their professional training and development.  I don't know much about sort of what the subject matter is, but as you get increasingly senior and more accomplished and graduate through the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3390538479

3990538479pgNbr=447
Page 25fl

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   programs, you get invited to higher and higher

3   level courses.  And the basic courses that I have

4   heard mentioned, only because it's simple enough b       for me to remember, is there's basically three

6   courses, PM 101, PM 201, PM 301, PM 301 being the

7   apex of the courses that you can take for the most

8   advanced, most promising corporate affairs

9   directors typically who, you know, hopefully are

10   going to be candidates to be vice president, one

11   day.  It's that kind of executive leadership

12   training.

13             And the very first 301 course, this was

14   all instituted a couple years back, I'm not sure

15   exactly when, and the first group who went through

16   301 were at a hotel or a place called Arden.  I

17   don't know what Arden really was, I think it was

18   the name of the hotel.  And there were 13 of them,

19   and they referred to themselves as Arden 13.  They

20   had a very good experience, became a tight-knit

21   group and wound up making  having a big dinner

22   with some of the very most senior people in

23   corporate affairs and having a long discussion with

24   them about ways they wc lid like to see the company

25   evolve and things they would like to see the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

Page 259

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    company do.  And I think that that group, at least

3    at that time, sort of raaae a commitment to each

4    other to keep in touch.  They are from all over the !:>        place, Europe and Asia and different operating

6   companies, it's from all over the corporate affairs

7    universe.  So I think they have tried to maintain a B        network amongst themselves of young, up-and-coming 9        corporate affairs promising executives determined

10    to move forward the company's agenda in a positive

11    way.

12         Q.    Can you name who from Philip Morris USA

13    is a member of the -- if anyone, of the Arden 13?

14         A.   Of the Arden 13.  I don't think I can do

15    that.  I know that  and I almost have a memory

16    that there was not anyone from PM USA on it, but I

17    don't want to put too much stock in that.  I only

18    say that I was at a meeting where Arden 13

19   presented to some corporate affairs executives, and

20    that's why I think I have this recollection that

21    there was no one from PM USA.

22               But I can only specifically remember

23   three people who were part of the Arden 13, because

24    they were people that I either knew or had dealings

25   with or who were my clients, and so those are the

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454pgNbr=449
Page 260

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    ones I remember.  I don't remember anyone else.

3   And none of those three are from PM USA.

4         Q.    Are you familiar with the corporate

5    issues project at Philip Morris?

6        A.   Yes.  I'd like to try to get some

7    clarity on what you all think you are referring to,

8    because I sometimes get confused.  There was a

9   corporate issues task force, there may have been

10    something else that someone may have referred to as

11    a corporate issues project, so as much specificity

12    as possible may help me identify the right thing.

13         Q.   Are you familiar with something referred IA        to as a corporate issues project that was in

15   existence in October of 2000?  Does that help?

16        A.    October of 2000.  Let's put it this way:

17    I'm not asking you to give me clues.  If it

IB         involved David Nicoli, I think I know what you are

19         talking about.  If it didn't, then maybe I don't

2 0         know what you are talking about.

21         Q.    If it  if the corporate issues project

22    involved David Nicoli, to what what is the 2:3        corporate issues project that you are familiar 24        with?

2 5       A.    That I'm thinking of.  Okay.  David

2   Nicoli's group in corporate corporate affairs,

3   strategy and responsibility, or corporate

4    responsibility, was given the task of trying to

5   drive a process or create a process pursuant to

6   which what they referred to as corporate issues

7   could be managed and resolved and made progress on,

8   Corporate issues meaning issues that were at a PM

9   Companies group level, because they cut across all

10    the operating companies or had some sort of global

11    or material impact on the overall corporation.  So

12   examples of possible corporate issues could be, it

13   was kind of like an emerging trends kind of

14    initiative, child labor, environmental issues,

15   workplace exploitation, kind of like the Nike kind

1 6       of problem, if you understand what I'm referring

17    to.  So Nicoli's group developed a process pursuant

18    to which those issues could be surfaced, a task

3 9        force formed including members of all the operating

20   companies reporting into a sort of executive

21    triumvirate  trio would be better  and they

22    could figure out how the companies could arrive at

23   policies or practices with respect to those kinds

24    of issues.

2 5                               And I said child labor, child or slave

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   labor, because again, if I'm talking about the same

3   thing you are talking about, that process was

4   established, it was agreed by senior management at

5   PM Companies, and the first task force that was

6   established in fulfillment of corporate issues 

7   in fulfillment of the corporate issues process was

8   to formulate a policy on child and slave labor.

9             That happened throughout 2001, I guess,

10   so maybe October 2000 could have been possible that

11   it was starting, although I would have guessed a

12   little later.  And that was example number 1, so

13   that's what I'm thinking of.

14        Q.    Do you know whether any aspect of the

15   corporate issues project is ongoing?

16        A.    There's a current task force in

17   existence, chaired by Nicoli, that I believe is

18   pursuant to that process, and that's called the

1.9       corporate codes task force.  Corporate codes being

20   the question of should Philip Morris Companies or

21   any of its operating companies sign up to any of

22   these corporate codes of conduct that have been

2 3         published.  There's one called the UN Compact that

24   Secretary General Annan has asked big corporations

25   to sign up.  There's one called the Sullivan

Page 263 ].                                       Berlind - Confidential

2    Principles that I think might be the famous one of

3    these.   There's a whole bunch of them.

4               These corporate codes are getting to be

5    in vogue now, and as a responsible group of

6    companies and as a company that  as a group of

7    companies that wants to be in the forefront of 6        promoting responsible business practices, this

9        current task force, which I believe is currently

10    functioning and hasn't reached any conclusions yet,

11    is looking at the question of whether or not our

12    companies should consider signing up to one of

13    these corporate codes.  And I think that's part of

14    the corporate issues process.

15         Q.    Do you know what the Small Business

16    Congress is?

17         A.    I think I have heard the name, but I

18    couldn't tell you what it is, could not tell you

19    what it is.

20               MR. GOLDFARB:  I'm going to hand the

21         court reporter what's been marked as  what

22         will be marked as Berlind number 10.

Berlind - Confidential MR. GOLDFARB:  For the record/ this is

document number 20852 91138.  It's a one-page

document,

Q.    Let me know when you've had a chance to take a look at it, please.

(Witness reviews document.]

A.    Okay.  I have looked at it.

Q.    Have you seen this document before?

A.   Not that I can recall.

Q.   What is this document?

MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

A.   Well, it's a little confusing to me. It says "to Cahill Gordon for professional fees" -~ if I'm reading it right, it's an invoice from Cahill Gordon Rhindel, which is a firm here in New York.  So I think it's Cahill  says "to," that's what I don't understand, but it looks like a Cahill Gordon invoice addressed to something called the Small Business Congress, but it's care of David Remes, who is at Covington and Burling in Washington.  And it's a bill for a $126,000 in connection with New York advertising restrictions.

Q.    Do you know vhat the Small Business Congress is?

2                    A.          No,   sir.

3        Q.    Who is David Remes?

4        A.   He is a lawyer at Covington and Burling,

5   who has represented different tobacco companies as

6   well as, over the years, on regulatory issues

7   including, and also the Tobacco Institute, I

8   believe.

9        Q.    The document is dated January 11, 2000;

10   is that correct?

11        A.    Yes.

12        Q.   Why would this document be sent to

13   Philip Morris?

14             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

15        A.    Well, the answer is I don't know.  If:

16   you want me to speculate, I will, because putting 1'7       this stuff together, T can offer you a pure

113       speculation.

19        Q.          Please.

20        A.    Okay.  It says that it's in connection

21   with advertising restrictions in New York.  There

22   was a  there were some advertising restrictions

23   passed in New York. This timing makes sense to me, 2 4       I don't know exactly when they were passed. I know 25       there was litigation commenced that the  some of

3990538487pgNbr=455
Page 2f>6

1                Berlind - Confidential

2   the tobacco companies, if not all of them, were

3   involved in.  The restrictions were struck down on

4   either preemption, federal preemption or First

5   Amendment grounds or both.

6             I don't really know what involvement PM

7   USA might have had,  I didn't have any involvement

8   in overseeing or having any connection with that

9   lawsuit, although I think I remember reading the

10   opinion when it came out.

11             David Remes typically represented the

12   industry on those kinds of matters, especially

13   advertising matters.  He considered himself to have

14   expertise in both First Amendment and Federal

15   Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act preemption

16   issues.  So it looks like clearly Remes was

17   involved in this litigation  oh, the last piece

18   of the puzzle is Remes would also work with Lloyd

19   Abrams, who is at Cahill Gordon, which makes me

20   think it could have been a First Amendment issue,

21   at least that being part of the case.  So clearly

22   this was all in connection with that litigation.

23             Whether the Small Business Congress was

24   another client of Remes, but oftentimes it's not

25    just tobacco companies who are plaintiffs in these

.1                                             Berlind - Confidential

2    kind of lawsuits, there are local groups who have

3    an interest in it one way or another.  I don't know

4    who they are, but: they seem to be working with b         Remes in some way.  But I bet you it's in

6         connection with litigation over advertising

1         restrictions.

8          Q.    Do you know whether Philip Morris paid

9    any of these legal fees'? 10        A.    No, I don't.

31       Q.    Do you knov; whether Philip Morris has

12    supported the Small Business Congress financial]y

13    in any way?

14                 MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

15          A.    I don't know.

16                 MR. GOLDFARB:  Let's just go off the

17          record.  I think I'm

19          minute?

2 0                                     MR. GOLDFARB:  Take a minute to look

2             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is 6:37.

3        We are back on the record.

4        Q.   Mr. Berlind, when did you begin making

5   public appearances on behalf of Philip Morris,

6   speeches, media interviews and so forth?

7             MR. FREDERICK:  Objection.

8        A.    The first one that I remember with any

9   specificity was in connection with the oral

10   argument at the Supreme Court for the FDA

11   litigation, meaning the litigation over whether the

12   FDA rule was  that had been promulgated by

13   Commissioner Kessler was authorized under the Food

14   Drug and Cosmetic Act.  So the oral argument was, X lb       suppose, in the fall of 1999 sometime.  There may

16   have been something before that but I think that

17   was the first time they asked me to do.

18        Q.    How frequently have you acted as a

19   spokesperson for Philip Morris?

20        A.    It's kind of random.  If you add it all

21   up since then, there's been a fair number of tiraes

22   in different contexts, but it's not any regular --

23   I don't have any regularized role in that regard.

24             What happens is, if they have either a

25   media inquiry or a speaking opportunity that they

3990538490pgNbr=458
Page 26V

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    think for some reason I would be well-suited to be

3   the one to respond to, the corporate communications

4   people will simply ask me to do it.  There's no

5    regular process to it.

6        Q.    And would that usually  was Peggy

7    Roberts the corporate communications person?

8         A.    Yes, Peggy Roberts would be with respect.

9    to corporate corporate affairs from PMMC.  I

10    sometimes get requests from the communications

11    department of PM USB.  And I occasionally, very

12    occasionally have gotten a request from the

13   communications group at PM International.

14         Q.    Can you estimate how frequently these

15    requests are made of you?

16         A.    It's hard to put a frequency, because

17    it's so random.  I mean sometimes -- there was a

18    week not too long ago, a few months ago, where for

19    some reason it seemed like almost every day there

20   was a request.  There had been periods of months

21    and months where there had been no requests.  So

22    it's kind of more related to what's going on.

23               The period I'm referring to there was

24    the introduction, was right at the time of the

25    introduction of several important FDA bills,

Esquire Deposition Services 1-800-944-9454

3990538491pgNbr=459
Page 270

1                  Berlind - Confidential

2    including the FDA bill that Philip Morris USA is

3    supporting.  So part of my job currently, as

4    legislative counsel, I'm very familiar with the

5    legislation and what's in it so there were just, a

6    number of requests centering on that.  That's a

7    good example of just how event specific that

8    activity is.

9        Q.    Is Philip Morris working with other

10    tobacco companies in support of legislation that

11    will allow FDA to regulate tobacco products?

12         A.    Philip Morris USA is working, in the

13    teeth of fierce opposition of the other major

14    tobacco companies, in support of such legislation.

15         Q.    Is Philip Morris working with any

16    tobacco companies in support of legislation that

17    would allow FDA to regulate tobacco products?

18         A.    No,  I would say working with would not

19    be an applicable term.  There have been some

20    exchange of ideas from time to time with U.S.

21    Tobacco, not a cigarette company, and they have not

22    come out in support of the approach we are taking

23    but  nor have they come out adversely, against

24    it.  They've just kind ->f been neutral.

2'>        Q.    Have there been any other cigarette

2    companies with which Philip Morris has worked in

3    support of such legislation?

4          A.    No, not that I'm aware of.

5                 MR. GOLDFARB:  I have no further

6          questions.

7                 MR. FREDERICK:  I have no questions.

8          We will reserve signature pending review of

9          the transcript.  Please designate the

10          transcript as confidential, as confidential

11           information may have been disclosed during

12          the course of Mr. Berlind's testimony today.

13                 MR. GOLDFARB:  And can we get an

14          agreement that I think it's about six hours,

15          and --

16                 MR. FREDERICK:  52 minutes, I believe.

17                 MR. GOLDFARB:  Six hours and 52

18          minutes?

19                 MR. FREDERICK:  We agree.

approved our moving ahead with the FSI.   My group is working with YSP to get everything pinned down with the jre and to move ahead on a timeline that will drop the insert toward the end of September.

b revising the home page of the internet, which I will share with both of you week after next, and reorganizing the it based on the feedback that we got in the focus groups.   This will not involve a lot of rewriting, but just nizing the information.   We will share all of our recommendations before we move ahead on this.

, the budget estimates seem to be somewhat lower than we originally anticipated.   We will have exact numbers in two weeks. But self funding between YSP and CA will definitely not be a problem.

n vacation this coming week, but wil! be back in for the senior team meeting on May 28 and will bring you up to date ire we are then, but for now we are moving ahead.

tie following Newspaper List brings us to a $5.4 million total estimate:

The deck from Starcom includes information on reach, composition and duplication in markets where we had 2 papers (Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Washington).

With the goal of reaching $5 million Starcom eliminated the Washington Times and San Francisco Examiner which makes sense given there is a negligible increase in reach to Opinion Leaders by adding the second paper (Washington reach goes from 52% to 55% and San Francisco from 27% to 28.7%).

The $5.4 million includes both the Dallas Morning News and Ft. Worth Star Telegram which combined give a 51% reach to OL in that market.

What is not included in the $5.4 million is the Chicago Sun-Times and the Boston Herald. I would recommend that we add these two papers to the list to obtain actual costs. Adding the second paper to the Chicago market increases the reach among OLfrom 30% to 47% and in Boston from 29% to 40%.

Starcom is reminding us that the costs provided are rough and could go up or down from the estimates. Please let me know if this is clear with the attached information or if you would like to review in person, thanks, Shaunn

Media Reminder

I  Please keep in mind this is still a rough cost estimate using the tobacco group methodology for costing out magazine inserts which has been adjusted appropriately for newspapers. Media costs are dependent on the size of the Insert. Please note that final media costs may be up or down from the estimates provided, We will not be able to give final costs until the vendors have the opportunity to provide costs based on the specific corporate responsibility sample insert.

TO:            All PM USA Employees                                            DATE: November 11, 2002

FROM:      Ellen Merlo, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs SUBJECT: PM USA runs advertising to encourage public to visit its website

One of the most effective ways for us to communicate to the general public about our company and our issues is through our website, philipmorrisusa.com.

To encourage more people to visit our website to learn more about our company, our policies and our positions, we are launching a Free Standing Insert (FSI) in November. The FSI contains information about the site and offers a 20-page booklet with excerpts from some of the tobacco-related sections on our site. In addition, to further enhance its effectiveness, we have recently redesigned philipmorrisusa.com by improving the navigation and giving the site a new look and feel.

The sections highlighted in the 20-page booklet that is bound into the FSI are: cigarette smoking and disease, addiction, quitting smoking, low tar cigarettes, ingredients, secondhand smoke and youth smoking prevention.

The FSI will appear in national and local newspapers throughout the country, including USA Today and The New York Times as well as the Richmond Times Dispatch, Washington Post and Charlotte Observer from November 13-17, 2002.

Employees will be able to find copies of the FSI at convenient locations in PM USA facilities. Members of the field sales force will receive copies by mail.

Our goal with the FSI is to raise awareness of our website. It is part of our ongoing effort to communicate openly and honestly with stakeholders about tobacco-related issues. We encourage you to pick up a copy of the FSI and visit our newly redesigned website.   If you don't have access to the site, please call 1-877-PMUSA-WEB for printed excerpts from philipmorrisusa.com. We hope you like the new look and feel of the website and that you find it a convenient and useful resource about our company, our policies and our positions.

The deskdrop will be placed as an article on the PM USA intranet along with an image of the FSI.   PMMC corporate communications will also send a deskdrop to all PMMC employees with a link to the FSI article on the PM USA intranet.

Additionally, select PM USA. and PMMC departments including Government Affairs, External Affairs and CA-California received a sample external stakeholder letter to inform key stakeholders about the upcoming FSI drop. Those departments will also receive copies of the FSI for future stakeholder outreach efforts.

If you would like additional details or have further questions about the internal or external FSI communications strategy, please feel free to contact me at x3054. Thank you.

er your request, the estimated reach for the PM USA Website Insert mong A18+ was 17%. This reach accounts for the readership among adults 8+ for each of the 39 newspapers, which includes the average number of eaders per copy. The estimated reach may be slightly high as it does ot factor in duplication between the national newspapers (USA Today and

SUBJECT:   PM USA Free Standing Insert

As part of PM USA's on-going effort to communicate openly and honestly with stakeholders about important tobacco-related issues, we are launching a Free Standing Insert (FSI) that will appear in select national and local newspapers throughout the country, including USA Today and The New York Times from November 13-17, 2002.

The FSI contains information about the philipmorrisusa.com website and offers a 20-page booklet with excerpts from some of the tobacco-related sections on our site.  In addition, to further enhance its effectiveness, we have recently redesigned our website by improving the navigation and giving the site a new look and feel. The goal of the FSI is to encourage people to visit our website to learn more about our company, our policies and our positions.

Attached is a copy of the complete media schedule for your reference.  Please let me know if you would like additional copies of the FSI for distribution to select Kraft employees and how many we should send.

[f you would like more information about the FSI or our communications strategy, please feel free to call me.

My only suggestion would be to consider adding the message that "there is no safe cigarette" before "Smokers should not assume..."

Ellen is out of the office next week but Mike is here if you need additional Corp Affairs input at this stage.

Subject: Position on Lights and Ultra Lights

Hi Brendan, we have been charged with developing language for a potential onsert on pack which commmunicates our position on Lights and Ultra Lights. I am not sure how many words we can use but you can imagine that being on the pack it is very few. my assignment is to try to extract the info from the web site (did you write this?) to develop a coherent but pithy message. Below is my first stab. I have asked the agency to let us know rouhgly how many words we could get on the onsert. My aim is to have something that I can send up to Legal in the early part of next week, i was wondering if you might be able to work on this with me. Can you please give me a call when you've a moment on 3657. (I have to leave at 1:30 today so I am sending you this via e-mail.) thanks, Margot Information for Smokers of "Lights" and "Ultra Lights" Products.

Philip Morris uses the terms "Light" and 'intra Light" for certain of its cigarette brands as descriptors of the strength of taste

and flavor, as well as a measure of the tar and nicotine in a cigarette, as measured by a machine.

The tar and nicotine numbers are not meant to communicate the precise amount of tar or nicotine inhaled by any individual, as no two smokers smoke cigarettes exactly the same way. Similarly, brand descriptors such as "Light" and "Ultra Light" do not indicate precisely how much tar or nicotine a particular smoker will inhale at any given time.

Smokers should not assume iower-tar brands are "safe" or "safer" than full-flavor brands. Philip Morris agrees

Merlo,

just took another look at the Journal of Public Health website. I think we need to give me thought to the possible content of all three articles in the Youth Smoking Prevention rum and to calls we might receive.

m also including a revision to the onsert copy -1 changed "product" in the 1 st line to "cigarettes" which was in 3 original copy we used on the 1st set of onsert comps - not sure why we changed it. I think cigarettes is sre straightforward for the adult smoker.

I         Revision 7.12.02

Important Information for Smokers:

1.  There is no such thing as a safe cigarette.

2.  The terms "Light" and "Ultra Light" are used for some cigarette brands as descriptors of the strength of taste and flavor. These terms, as well as "low tar," or "lowered tar and nicotine" also serve as an indicator of the average tar and nicotine yield per cigarette, as measured by a routine government method.

3.  The tar and nicotine yield numbers are not meant to communicate the precise amount of tar or nicotine inhaled by any individual, as individuals do not smoke like the machine used in the government method. The amount of tar and nicotine an individual inhales may be higher than the stated tar and nicotine yield numbers if, for example, the individual blocks ventilation holes, inhales more deeply, takes more puffs or smokes more cigarettes.

4.  Similarly, brands with descriptors such as "Light," or "Ultra Light" may not deliver less tar and nicotine than other brands. It depends on how the individual smokes.

5.  Smokers should not assume that cigarette brands using descriptors like "Lights" or "Ultra Lights" arc less harmful than full-flavor cigarette brands or that smoking such cigarette brands will help them quit smoking. Smokers concerned about the health

As we discussed, could you find out if this full disclaimer (which changes "won't" to "will NOT") fits around the pack, without bGing cut off:

"Lights" does NOT mean safer. It refers to taste. "Lights" will NOT help you quit smoking.

As you pointed out, "Ultra Lights" is even longer.  Could you please ask Packaging Services if the full disclaimer fits around the pack when each of the descriptors (Lights, Ultra Lights, Milds and Medium) is used.  If it does not fit, we may look to shorten it (by returning to "won't" or by shortening it further).

Finally, for Mediums, the wording should be:

"Medium" does NOT mean safer. It refers to taste. "Mediums" will NOT help you quit smoking.

Thanks Kim. I'm setting up a meeting for tomorrow.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. RESPONDS TO NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE REPORT

Company says there is no safe cigarette

New York, November 27,2001  Philip Morris U.S.A. and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) agree on many important issues about cigarette smoking, including some of those addressed in NCI's most recent report.

We support efforts to provide adult smokers with more information about the meaning of reported tar ind nicotine numbers. Philip Morris U.S.A. supports federal legislation that would give the FDA egulatory authority over cigarettes, including authority and direction to address several of the issues aised by the NCI.

'hilip Morris U.S.A. does not imply in our marketing, and smokers should not assume, that "light" or ultra light" brands are "safer" than full-flavor brands. We do agree though that there is no safe igarette and that to reduce the health risks of smoking, the best thing to do is quit.

or those adults who choose to smoke, we believe descriptors such as "low-tar," "mild," and "light" urve as useful points of comparison for cigarette brands regarding characteristics such as strength of ste and reported tar yield.

re provide information on our Web site about tar and nicotine numbers and what they mean and do not ean. Philip Morris U.S.A. cigarette brand advertising that carries a tar and nicotine disclosure also ;ars a legend that says: 'The amount of "tar" and nicotine you inhale will vary depending on how you loke the cigarette."

any of the points included in the NCI press release are similar to those discussed on our Web site, ick here to visit www.philipmorrisusa.com for more information.

We believe that manufacturers should be allowed to continue use of descriptors such as "full flavor", "light" and "ultra light" to describe brands with differing taste characteristics and reported taj and nicotine yields. However, the limitations of descnptors and the average tar and nicotine measurements to which they relate should also be explained. For that reason, Philip Morris U.S.A. supports FDA regulations that would establish a uniform and consistent method for determining and describing specific ranges or reported tar yield. We also support measures to remind consumers that there is no such thing as a "safe" cigarette, and that a lower reported yield does not mean "safe," or "safer" than other brands.

develop regulations designed to describe the limitations of the tar and nicotine machine tests, and advise consumers that their actual intake of these constituents will vary depending on how they smoke their cigarette;

develop regulations that would require manufacturers to apply descriptors in a uniform manner, and inform consumers about their limitations; and

Explaining Tar and Nicotine Numbers

No two smokers smoke cigarettes exactly the same way. The tar and nicotine yield numbers that are reported for cigarette brands are not meant (and were never intended) to communicate the precise amount of tar or nicotine inhaled by any individual smoker from any particular cigarette. These numbers come from standardized testing methods, which compare different brands when smoked by a machine under identical laboratory conditions. As regulators have said since their introduction, these tests  including those developed in cooperation with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - show the relative differences in yields among brands, assuming that each brand is held and smoked the same way as it is in the machine.

We support efforts to provide consumers with more information about the meaning of the tar and nicotine numbers. We believe that adult smokers should be able to continue to choose from a wide range of brands whose yields are measured by a standardized method. At the same time, we recognize government and public health concerns about the information as well as the way in which this information is presented to consumers.

Specifically, public health authorities have suggested that smokers of lower average-yield brands are not achieving meaningful reduction in their tar and nicotine intake.

For this reason, we would also support legislation giving FDA authority to establish standards for providing this information to consumers, and would encourage public health authorities to work with the tobacco industry to determine whether lower yield products (as measured by the machine tests) in fact reduce exposure and risk to smokers.

PETITION FOR RULEMAKING PRELIMINARY STATEMENT Philip Morris Incorporated ("PM"), by counsel and pursuant to 16 C.F.R.  1.9 and Section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ("FTCA"), 15 U.S.C.  57(aXl)(B), hereby petitions the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") to promulgate rules governing:

(1) the disclosure of average tar and nicotine yields of cigarette brands,

(2) the use of disclaimers with respect to average tar yield and the health effects of "low-yield" cigarettes, and

(3) the use of descriptors, such as "light'* and ''ultra light*'

1     The FTC has historically defined "low-yield" cigarettes by tar range. For instance,

as early as 1968, the FTC established three "categories" of tar yields: 15 mg and under,

16-21 mg; and 22 mg. The FTC characterized low-yield cigarettes as those having 15

milligrams of tar or less. FTC Report to Congress at 18-19 (June 30,1968) (Ex. 1). As

the industry succeeded in reducing average tar yields, standardized industry practices in

the use of descriptors is reflective of those reductions. Today, continuing to rely on the

FTC method, the industry standard for full-flavor cigarettes are those with an average

yield of 15 mg or more tar per cigarette; light cigarettes those with an average yield of 7

to 14 mg of tar per cigarette; and ultra lights an average yield of less than 7 rag of tar per

cigarette.                                                                                                                         g

The requested action by the FTC is appropriate in light of recent scientific developments, described below, culminating in the release of the National Cancer Institute's Risk Associated with Smoking Cigarettes with Low Machine-Measured Yields of Tar and Nicotine, Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 13, Bethesda, MD: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Pub. No. 02-5074 (Oct. 2001) (Ex. 2) ("Monograph 13").

By this petition, PM is requesting that the FTC take immediate action in response to evolving scientific information about low-yield cigarettes. Historically, the FTC has played a central role in developing the method for measuring average tar and nicotine yields and in determining what communications would be permitted regarding those yields. Beginning in the 1950s, credible scientific evidence began appearing suggesting that reductions in tar and nicotine yields in cigarettes would reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as lung cancer.2 Based on this evidence, the public health community urged tobacco companies to develop and market low-yield cigarettes and repeatedly advised smokers who would not quit to smoke low-yield cigarettes.3

In March 1966, consistent with the position of the public health community, the FTC announced that it would permit statements of average tar and nicotine yield, but

only if such statements were based on the results of a standardized test method - the Cambridge Method:

On the basis of the facts now available to it, the Commission has determined that a factual statement of the tar and nicotine content... would not be in violation of [FTC] Guides, or of any of the provisions of law administered by the Commission, so long as (1) no collateral representation (other than factual statement of tar and nicotine contents of cigarettes offered for sale to the public) are made, expressly or by implication, as to reduction or elimination of health hazards, and (2) the statement of tar and nicotine content is supported by adequate records of tests conducted in accordance with the Cambridge Filter Method... ,4

The FTC made clear mat the measurements provided by the Cambridge Method should

be the only measurements communicated to the public: "statements or representations'' of

tar or nicotine yield based on other testing methodologies '*would tend to contuse and

mislead the public."5 Three years later, the FTC proposed a trade regulation rule

requiring the disclosure of tar and nicotine ratings in cigarette advertisements* The

tobacco industry responded by voluntarily agreeing to disclose average tar and nicotine

yields as measured by the Cambridge Method in cigarette advertising - and has continued

to do so to this day.7

Throughout the last several decades, the FTC continued to monitor the tobacco companies* statements regarding average tar and nicotine yields. The FTC has specifically permitted the use of descriptors, such as "low," "lower" and "reduced" tar that reflect the Cambridge Method's yield measurements.* In September 1997, the FTC most recently raised the issue of whether the use of the Cambridge Method test is potentially misleading to smokers who might think that the average per cigarette yields disclosed reflect actual smoker intake. Accordingly, the FTC issued a notice for comment on proposed revisions to the testing methodology.9 At the same time, the FTC expressed concern about descriptive terms such as "light" and **ultra light" and asked for comment: **Is there a need for official guidance with respect to the terms used in marketing lower rated cigarettes? If yes, why? If no, why not?"10 In 1998, the FTC requested that the Department of Health and Human Services (**HHS") "conduct a complete review of the FTCs cigarette testing methodology." The HHS in turn asked the National Cancer Institute ("NCT) to review the evidence of the relationship between machine-measured cigarette yields and disease risk. Three years later, on November 27, 2001, the NCI issued Monograph 13. In response to the Monograph, the FTC stated that it would be "working with" HHS "to fix the current cigarette tar and nicotine testing methodology." No timetable has been set, and the matter is pending.

See. e.g.. Decision and Order, In the Matter of American Brands. Inc.. No. 8799 (Aug. 20,1970) (Ex. 13); 59 Fed. Reg. 51,980, at 51,981 (Oct. 13,1994) (Ex, 14).

In short, the FTC for the last five years has been considering what action, if any, to take on the subject matter of low tar cigarettes. Meanwhile, since 1997, concerns have increased with respect to (1) whether the FTC's Cambridge Method provides meaningful information to consumers and (2) whether descriptors, such as "light" and "ultra light," are potentially misleading to some consumers.11 Recently emerging scientific analyses, such as those presented in NCFs Monograph 13, have placed into doubt the premise under which the FTC previously acted in this area; that low-yield cigarettes reduce the risk of harm. NCrs Monograph 13 concludes that "[t]here is no convincing evidence that changes in cigarette design between 1950 and the mid 1980s have resulted in an important decrease in the disease burden caused by cigarette use either for smokers as a group or for the whole population."12

Against this backdrop, PM respectfully files this petition asking the FTC to take immediate and appropriate action in light of the current state of the science in this area. Specifically, PM submits that, in response to recent criticism of the Cambridge Method, the FTC should reconsider its use of the Cambridge Method and consider whether a new method for determining tar and nicotine yields will more accurately estimate tar and nicotine delivery to the smoker. PM stands ready to assist the FTC in attempting to develop such a method. Further, PM submits that the FTC should require disclosure of tar and nicotine yields (as measured by the Cambridge Method or, if adopted, an

alternative method) and require that any such disclosure be accompanied by certain

disclaimers. The purpose of these disclaimers would be to communicate to the public

uniform and consistent messages: (1) that the amount of tar delivered by any cigarettes

depends on how a person smokes the cigarette, (2) that smokers may intake more tar and

nicotine than estimated by the Cambridge Method, (3) that low-tar cigarettes have not

been established to be safer than other cigarettes, and (4) that smoking low-tar cigarettes

does not make quitting smoking easier. Finally, PM submits that the FTC - while

requiring the above-described disclaimers - should continue to allow the use of

descriptors to differentiate among brands and brand styles, particularly within a single

brand family, and to provide information relating to differences in taste. The FTC,

however, should promulgate appropriate regulations to ensure that descriptors are used in

a uniform manner throughout the industry and are defined by specific tar and nicotine

ranges as prescribed by tine FTC.

BACKGROUND

I.       CURRENT REGULATORY SCHEME RELATING TO TAR AND NICOTINE TESTING AND DISCLOSURE

For more man three decades, the FTC has collected and published average per cigarette tar and nicotine yields using the Cambridge Testing Method, At the FTC's request, the cigarette companies entered into an agreement requiring the disclosure of these average yields in advertisements. Consistent with th& FTC's policy, the cigarette companies have used descriptors such as light" and **ultra light" to refer to taste characteristics as well as to ranges of average tar and nicotine yields.

The instant petition is submitted against the backdrop of the FTC's actions and regulations in this area, which we outline below.

A-       The FTC's Decision to Ban Tar and Nicotine Disclosures

In the mid-1950s, in response to what it perceived as a rising number of health

claims in cigarette advertising, the FTC issued Cigarette Advertising Guidelines, Among

other things, the Guidelines prohibited claims "that any brand of cigarette or the smoke

therefiom is low in nicotine or tars,.. when it has not been established by competent

scientific proof... that such difference or differences are significant"13 In December

1959, the FTC notified the industry that it considered "all representations of low or

reduced tar... to be health claims" and advised each manufacturer to cease making such

representations.14 In short, the FTC took the position that disclosures of tar and nicotine

yields were inherently deceptive and would not be allowed. A month later, the FTC

negotiated an agreement with the industry banning tar and nicotine advertising.15

Although the agreement was technically voluntary, the Chairman of the FTC

subsequently explained that, if necessary, the Commission would have enforced the

agreement with litigation:

[The Guidelines) constituted, in effect, informal advice and guidance to industry with respect to the regulatory posture which the Commission had reason to believe would be established as a basis for issuance of complaints, and

subsequent proceedings under Section 5(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act-----

In 1960, then, the Commission was informing the industry that in its opinion the evidence then available would support a complaint against any marketer who made any reference to tar and nicotine content, charging that such a reference was false and misleading.16

B.      Growing Evidence in Support of Lower Tar and Nicotine

At the same time that the FTC was banning disclosure of tar and nicotine yields,

scientific evidence began to emerge indicating that lowered yields of tar and nicotine

reduce the risk of contracting certain types of disease, such as lung cancer. For example,

in (he 1950s, scientists discovered a dose-response relationship between skin tumors ui

laboratory animals and exposure to cigarette tar.17 Scientists inferred from this evidence

that reducing the tar yields of cigarettes might reduce the risk of lung cancer. In 1957,

Dr. Ernst Wynder - one of the pioneers of smoking and health research - advocated a

40% reduction in tar yields based on the findings in the mouse skin painting

experiments.18 Dr. Wynder's historic recommendation led the way to a public health

consensus that tar and nicotine reductions were an important potential means of reducing

the health risks associated with smoking.

8pgNbr=566
In 1966, the\J.S. Public Health Service convened a technical committee of

scientific experts to consider whether tar and nicotine reductions should be encouraged.

After evaluating the evidence, the committee concluded that:

[t]he preponderance of scientific evidence strongly suggests that the lower the *tar' and nicotine content of cigarette smoke, the less harmful would be the effect

The committee **recommend[ed] to the Surgeon General that action be encouraged which

will result in the progressive reduction of the *tar' and nicotine content of cigarette

smoke."19

In an effort to obtain additional evidence as to whether reductions in tar would be

beneficial, in the mid-1960s scientists began to conduct epidemiological studies that

examined the effects of smoking low-yield cigarettes. The scientists compared the

disease rates for smokers of low-yield or filtered cigarettes to the disease rates for

smokers of high-tar, non-filtered or "full-flavored" cigarettes. The NCI published the

first study of this kind in 1968. The study showed that smokers who switched to filtered

cigarettes had a 40% reduced risk of lung cancer as compared to smokers of oraer

cigarettes. The author concluded that further tar and nicotine reductions could provide

even greater protection:

These findings provide the first human evidence that redesign of the product can reduce health hazards. They indicate that, if full advantage were taken of existing fitter

and other cigarette technology, a greater protection could be provided immediately.20

This finding was confirmed almost immediately in a 1970 epidemiological study conducted by Dr. Wynder, who found that filtered cigarette smokers had a reduced risk of lung cancer compared to non-filtered cigarette smokers,21

C      The FTC Reverses Its Position

As a result of this growing scientific evidence that filtered cigarettes reduce the risk of certain types of disease, the FTC in March 1966 reversed its position and allowed the disclosure of tar and nicotine yields in cigarette advertisements - albeit only under certain conditions. The FTC sent letters to each of the manufacturers explaining that wa factual statement of the tar and nicotine content (expressed in milligrams) of (he mainstream smoke from a cigarette would not be in violation" of the 1955 Guidelines, so long as the measurements are "supported by adequate records of tests conducted in accordance with the Cambridge Filter Method."22 Its goal was "to encourage cigarette manufacturers to provide consumers with comparative information about their products* tar and nicotine yields;."23 The FTC subsequently explained that this decision to "augment information available to the public on the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes'*

was *'[b]ased on the proposition that lower yield cigarettes present a lessened hazard to

the American public."24 The FTC admonished, however, that "statements or

representations" of tar yield "based on non-standardized tests having no official or

governmental sanction would tend to confuse and mislead the public*'25 - and thus would

not be allowed.

At about the same time, the FTC issued a notice seeking comment as to "what

action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or

ampUfying the Cambridge Filter Method*1 and announced that it would hold a hearing on

the subject26 Before the hearing, the tobacco industry made a submission advising the

FTC about the difficulties that are inherent in measuring the tar that any individual

smoker will intake: "Cigarette smokers vary greatly in their manner of smoking -

puffing rate, volume, frequency, length of cigarette smoked, etc.**27 After the hearing, the

industry again pointed out the Hmitations of the proposed testing methodology.

The [Cambridge] Method does not and cannot measure these many variations in human smoking habits.2

Notwithstanding the industry's observations regarding the limitations of the testing method, the FTC began testing cigarettes by the Cambridge Method in August 1967.39 The FTC justified its use of the Cambridge Method in a press release, in which the Commission acknowledged the limitations of its method.30 At times copying the industry's statements verbatim, it advised that u[n]o two human smokers smoke in the same way" and that its test "does not and cannot measure these many variations in human smoking habits.*'31 The FTC noted further that its method does not even attempt to

18    Supplemental Observations Following November 30,1966 Hearing Before the Federal Trade Commission at 2-3 (emphasis in original) (Ex. 28).The industry continued to point out the limits of the test method even after the Cambridge method was adopted. For instance, in the context of the Barclay dispute, discussed below, Brown & Williamson advised the FTC that "[a|ny one smoker can and may reduce the dilution by the way he or she holds the cigarette with hand or lips."

determine **the amount of smoke, or tar and nicotine, which the 'average* smoker will draw from any particular cigarette," because "there are too many variables as to both smokers and smoking conditions for any average to be meaningful" Indeed, the FTC was concerned that any attempt to determine results for an "average" smoker "could be misleading to the public,, because a smoker has no way of knowing how closely his smoking habits conform to those of the purportedly 'average* smoker."32

Nonetheless, the FTC made clear that it would require the use of the Cambridge Method. The FTC concluded that "the public interest requires that all test results presented to the public be based on a uniform method" because **use of more than one testing method ... would only serve to confuse or mislead the public.     The FTC chose the Cambridge Method to be the "uniform method" because it provides a "reasonable standardized method" that was "capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable.'*34 Finally, the FTC promised that it would "continue evaluating its results, and on that basis may determine in the future to change the number of cigarettes tested or any other testing procedures as may be found necessary.**35

Three years later, the FTC went a step further and proposed a trade regulation rule requiring the disclosure of tar and nicotine ratings in cigarette advertisements.^ Thus, in just 10 years, the FTC went from a position of banning tar and nicotine disclosures to a position of requiring such disclosures. In justifying its proposal, the FTC explained that 'Responsible medical opinion indicates that the reduction of tar and nicotine content in cigarette smoke decreases the hazard to the health" and thus "[t]o promote the public interest, advertisers should not be discouraged from promoting these varieties which rank low in tar and nicotine.'*17 The FTC believed that requiring tar and nicotine disclosures would serve two purposes. First, disclosures would ,clead those smokers who are unable to kick the habit to greater interest in obtaining a low tar and nicotine cigarette." Second, disclosures would encourage "competition among the cigarette companies to meet that interest"38

Notwithstanding its proposed regulations, the FTC sent a letter to the industry expressing its willingness "to explore... the possibility of reaching an agreement with all of the cigarette manufacturers on the inclusion of a statement of tar and nicotine

Dr. Stewart explained that "[w]e believe the consumer is entitled to know the tar and nicotine levels of his cigarette.... It is the view of the Public Health Service that this is useful information; that the lower these levels are, the less hazardous is the cigarette likely to be.** Cigarette Labeling and Advertising, Hearings on H.R. 643, H.R. 1237, H.R. 3055 & H.R. 6543 Before the House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong. 86 (1969) (statement of Dr. William H.

method of insuring compliance with the terms of any agreement.**39 In response, five of the six major manufacturers submitted a written plan agreeing to include tar and nicotine disclosures in advertising, and the FTC suspended its proposed trade rule indefinitely.40 The FTC explained that relying on the industry's plan would free its resources to pursue other matters, and at the same time warned that it would return to the proposed trade rule if necessary:

It appears to be in the public interest to afford the tobacco industry an opportunity to implement the letter and spirit of the amended plan which it has proposed. In taking this action, the Commission is retaining the unconditional right to reschedule the trade regulation rule proceedings and to take any other action relating to this subject at any time it deems such action to be necessary or desirable in the public interest.

The C^rnrnission believes that if the amended plan operates satisfactorily, the Commission will be able to employ substantial manpower and funds which would otherwise have been devoted to hearings and court proceedings to dealing with the serious problems relating to cigarette advertising.*1

D.       The Scientific and Public Health Community

Continued to Support Lower Tar and Nicotine Yields

1.       Scientific Evidence and Public Health Recommendations

Following the FTC's adoption of the Cambridge Method, scientific evidence continued to accumulate indicating that reductions in tar yield would reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as lung cancer.

Most notably, in 1976, the American Cancer Society ("ACS") published an epidemiological analysis of its groundbreaking Cancer Prevention Study ("CPS-I"). CPS-I tracked over one million Americans for a 12-year period. The study categorized its subjects as either "high," "medium," or "low" yield smokers, as determined by the Cambridge Method's measurements. The study found that* compared to smokers of high-tar and nicotine cigarettes, people who smoked low-yield cigarettes were 26% less likely to die from lung cancer. The study also found that the health benefits from low-yield cigarettes were not limited to lung cancer. Smokers of low-yield cigarettes had a 14% reduced risk of dying from heart disease and a 16% reduced total mortality rate. Encouraged by these findings, the ACS concluded **we think it fair to say that switching from 'high* [tar] to Mow* [tar] cigarettes was at least a small step in the right direction for those who continued to smoke cigarettes.**42

Numerous other studies in the United States and Europe similarly found that smokers of filtered or low-yield cigarettes as identified by the FTC or similar testing method had a reduced risk of disease:

         In 1981, an English study found that smokers of filtered cigarettes had less than 50% the lung cancer incidence of higher tar, non-filtered cigarette smokers/3

         In 1984, an epidemiological study based on seven locations in Western Europe found that male smokers of filtered cigarettes had a 41% reduction in lung cancer risk as compared to non-filtered smokers and that female smokers of filtered cigarettes had a 51% reduced risk. The authors concluded "our findings indicate that lifetime filter smokers have a lower risk relative to lifetime nonfilter smokers than previously thought... smoking cessation must be the primary goal of efforts to prevent lung cancer, although changing to low tar (filter) cigarettes should help in reducing the risk."44

         In 1992, an epidemiological study conducted by Dr. Wynder projected a 15-20% reduction in lung cancer risk for every 10-mg reduction in tar yields.45

         In 1995, a combined analysis of four British epidemiological studies found that "about a quarter of deaths from lung cancer, coronary heart disease, and possibly other smoking related diseases could be avoided by switching from higher tar cigarettes (30mg/cigarette) to lower tar ones (ISmg/cigarette)."46

As recently as 2001, researchers found that lung cancer mortality rates in young

Australian women had declined despite increases in smoking prevalence, concluding that

"[^eductions in tar yields... may be responsible."47

Relying on these and other studies, public health officials concluded that low tar cigarettes did reduce disease risk- In a 1981 comprehensive review, the Surgeon General concluded that "[t]oday's filter-tipped, lower 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer man do their higher *tar* and nicotine predecessors."41 In 1986, the International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC") similarly concluded that the epidemiological evidence "suggested] that prolonged use of non-filter and high-tar cigarettes is associated with greater lung cancer risks than prolonged use of filter and low-tar cigarettes.**49 More recently, in 1996, the NCI concluded that the <4more recent** scientific evidence continued to support the Surgeon GeneraTs 1981 conclusion that "[t]oday*s filter-tipped, lower 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer than do their higher 'tar' and nicotine predecessors."50

Consistent with these conclusions, the public health community throughout the world called for cigarette manufacturers to reduce tar and nicotine yields in their cigarettes*.

In 1983, the U.K. Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health concluded that it was "encouraged by the decrease in tar yields over the last few years and recommend a continued reduction."5

In 1985, the Fourth Scarborough Conference on Preventive Medicine - an international conference of public health authorities - issued a consensus statement declaring that "the policy [of encouraging tar and nicotine reductions] has been beneficial and that tar yields should be further reduced.*"5*

In 1988, the U.K. Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health again concluded that "Government and the tobacco industry should consider what further action could be taken to persuade more smokers to favour low tar brands."53

In 1991, Dr. Wynder reaffirmed the position he had advocated since the mid-1950s, explaining that "a strong social case is made for further developments in the low-yield cigarette."54

In 1998, the U.K. Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health again addressed the issue, recommending that a "policy of further tar reduction in manufactured cigarettes should be pursued."3

In 2000, the Health Committee of the House of Commons focused on the fact that, notwithstanding evidence of compensation, in the U.K. "cancer rates have Men faster than can be explained by changes in smoking prevalence and overall consumption of tobacco." The Committee considered this trend to be evidence that **tar reduction is responsible for

the health improvement/* leading it to "support further reduction in tar levels."5*

Furthermore, the public health community went one step further and expressly

urged smokers who would not quit to switch to a lower tar brand:

        In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. Government issued a pamphlet for

smokers, entitled "If You Must Smoke," that advised them to "[c]hoose a cigarette with less tar and nicotine,"57



In 1974, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued a poster listing the tar and nicotine yields of commercially available cigarettes and advising smokers to switch to the cigarette with the lowest yield: The Cigarette World is divided into the bad and the worse. You can buy as much as 34 mgs. of tar in a cigarette, or as little as 2. As much as 2.1 mgs. of nicotine, or as little as 0.2. There's a Tar & Nicotine list below that tells you which is which. Look them up. If you must smoke, at least bad is better than worse." S8

         In 1988, the Health Departments of the U.K. issued a poster recommending that smokers choose **a brand of cigarette in a lower tar group than the brand you smoke at present/159

          In 1989, the American Cancer Society issued a brochure, "Cancer Facts & Figures," that recommended that "those who are not yet able to quit would be well advised to switch to brands with the lowest possible tar and nicotine (T/N) content."60

2.       Compensation

In making these findings and recommendations, the scientific and public health

community was always well aware of issues surrounding possible "compensation" - i.e.,

changes in smoking behavior accompanying a switch to a cigarette with reduced tar and nicotine yields. In leading the call for low-yield cigarettes in 1957, Dr. Wynder made clear that any potential health benefit could be eliminated by compensation, such as increasing the number of cigarettes smoked,61 Similarly, as early as 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General expressed his concern to the public - reported in a popular U.S. newsmagazine - that "removing tar [and] nicotine... might also lead to different levels of cigarette consumption and different amounts of inhalation, and so forth."62

Nevertheless, the scientific community generally believed that the epidemiologic findings of a reduced risk would be valid even if smokers of low-yield cigarettes compensate. The reasoning was that the studies compare the risks of smokers of low-tar cigarettes to the risks of smokers of high-tar cigarettes - and thus would inherently take into account differences in how each category of smoker smokes and the extent to which those differences in smoking behavior may affect risk. Thus, the scientific community believed epidemiological findings of reduced risk from low-yield cigarettes were valid even if the smokers of low-yield cigarettes in the studies compensated.63 For example,

epidemiologist Dr. Jonathan Samet, in a 1996 review for NCI, explained that

epidemiology was particularly important in assessing the health effects of low-yield

cigarettes because it took compensation into account:

Epidemiologic research has had a central role in characterizing the consequences of the changing cigarette because it supplies direct information on the consequences of varying tar and nicotine yield products. Thus, the findings inherently consider compensatory changes in inhalation patterns or in numbers of cigarettes smoked and provide the evidence needed to answer the question of immediate public health relevance: whether disease risk varies with cigarette tar and nicotine yield as determined by the FTC method,64

E.       The FTC Continued to Re-evaluate Its Testing Methodology

Since 1970, and in light of the evolving scientific evidence, the FTC has

frequently reevaluated the propriety of its tar and nicotine rating, choosing in each

instance to retain it. In 1976, the FTC tentatively rejected as "inappropriate" a request by

Lorillard that its Kent Golden Lights be measured at a 5 mm depth of insertion into the

smoking machine (as opposed to 11 mm required by the Cambridge Method).*5 In a

separate letter to Lorillard, the FTC reaffirmed its view that "it would be deceptive to

advertise a tar figure which is higher than the latest applicable FTC tar figure.     At the

same time, however, the FTC acknowledged its concerns about whether its testing

methodology adequately accounted for the possibility of ventilation blocking:

Of special concern when considering any such modification of the standard 11 mm. insertion is whether the insertion depth would and should be decreased beyond the point consumers cover the cigarette with their lips, fingers, or both when they puff. The Commission believes that additional information is necessary before deciding whether further action should be taken in connection with this matter.

42 Fed. Reg. 21,155.

Based on these concerns, the FTC solicited further comments from the industry concerning whether the depth of insertion should be varied to account for the placement of ventilation holes, and torillard responded by arguing in favor of a varied depth of insertion.67 The FTC rejected Lorillard's position, explaining that "a change in the insertion depth would cause a lack of continuity with previous test results" and that it would thus be inappropriate to change the procedure "in the absence of information indicating that a new insertion depth would be more consistent with the manner in which smokers insert cigarettes in actual use."68

assessed inaccurately by the current FTC cigarette testing methodology.*     In June 1982, the FTC concluded that Barclay's tar rating was "inaccurate*' because "the unique construction of the Barclay filter resulted in it delivering less tar and nicotine during smoking by the testing machine than would be delivered to an actual smoker."70 In April 1983, after Brown & Williamson's attempt to enjoin the FTC from taking action had failed,71 the agency announced that it would no longer accept Barclay tar ratings based on the Cambridge Method.72 The FTC sought comment regarding alternate methods of measuring the tar yield of Barclay and whether it should continue using the Cambridge Method for other cigarette brands.73 Ultimately, the FTC retained the Cambridge Method. **[E] ven though the limitations on the predictiveness of the FTC method caused by compensatory smoking were clearly recognized," the FTC did not have a "sufficient basis for changing the protocol."74 There was "no clear consensus as to specific action the Commission could (or should) take to eliminate the limitations of the test method" and "abandoning the testing system without instituting another method would have been premature because then-current epidemiological evidence suggested that there had been a

reduction in lung cancer deaths that might be attributable to declines in average tar levels."75

Approximately a decade later, in July 1994, the FTC revisited the propriety of its rating system by asking the National Cancer Institute to convene a conference to evaluate the Cambridge method.76 The conference recommended certain changes, set forth in NCI Monograph 7, *The FTC Cigarette Test Method for Determining Tar, Nicotine, and Carbon Monoxide Yields of U.S. Cigarettes," published in 1996.77 These recommendations included;

         that the "system should also measure and publish information on the range of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields that most smokers should expect from each cigarette"

         that the "system must be accompanied by public education to make smokers aware that individual exposure depends on how the cigarette is smoked and that the benefits of switching to lower yield cigarettes are small compared with quitting"

         mat "[b]rand names and brand classifications such as 'light' and 'ultralight' represent health claims and should be regulated and accompanied, in fair balance, with an appropriate disclaimer'*

In response to these recommendations, the FTC in September 1997 issued a

that each cigarette variety be tested under two different sets of smoking conditions."78 Finally, in 1998, the FTC sought expert scientific advice again, requesting that HHS "conduct a complete review of the FTC's cigarette testing methodology.**79 The FTC explained that it "has been concerned for some time that the current test method may be misleading to individual consumers who rely on the ratings it produces" because the "current ratings tend to be relatively poor predictors of tar and nicotine exposure.***0

The FTC has not made any changes to its testing methodology (other than adding measurements for carbon monoxide). That methodology has now with the publication of Monograph 13 become the subject of more intense scrutiny and appears to have few, if any, supporters in the public health community. As discussed below, PM now formally petitions the FTC to once again review the testing methodology and, if possible, develop a more appropriate methodology supportable by scientists and the public health community.

F.       The FTC Scrutinized Use of Descriptors

Since 1970, the FTC has also scrutinized the manner in which the cigarette companies could use descriptors such as "ligfir" and '"lower" tar to characterize their cigarettes in advertisements. During this time period, the FTC made clear that manufacturers could use such descriptors provided that the advertisements also included the average tar measurements determined by the FTC method.

has represented and created the impression that its cigarettes are low in tar when in truth and in fact its Pall Mall Gold 100's and Lucky filters contain approximately 20 and 21 milligrams of tar, amounts which rank them 56th and 77th higher among the 122 brands tested than the brand containing the lowest tar level of 4 milligrams.82

The dispute ultimately resulted in a consent order, in which the FTC prohibited American

from:

Stating in advertising that any cigarette manufactured by it, or the smoke therefrom, is low or lower in '*tar" by use of the words "low," "lower," or "reduced" or like qualifying terms, unless the statement is accompanied bv a clear and conspicuous disclosure of:

1.         The "tar" and nicotine content in milligrams in the smoke produced bv the advertised cigarette: and

2.         If the **tar" content of the advertised brand is compared to that of another brand or brands of cigarette, (a) the "tar" and nicotine content in milligrams of the smoke produced by that brand or those brands of cigarette, and (b) the "tar" and nicotine content in milligrams of the lowest yield domestic cigarette; provided that a comparison to a class of cigarettes, or to many or most of the cigarettes of a class, shall not be deemed a comparison to another brand or brands of cigarette.83

Thus, in this consent decree, the FTC specifically permitted American to use "qualifying terms" such as "low" and "lower" provided that those terms were accompanied by a "conspicuous disclosure of [t]he tar and nicotine content in milligrams in the smoke,"

In the mid-1990s, the FTC again challenged an American advertisement, which represented that "consumers will get less tar by smoking 10 packs of Carlton than by smoking a single pack of the other brands shown in the ads, each of which was rated as having an average of more than 10 milligrams of tar per cigarette."*4 The FTC complained that the advertisements were deceptive because "consumers would not necessarily get less tar because the ratings shown in the ads were obtained by smoking machines that did not reflect actual smoking, partly because they did not account for 'compensatory smoking.'"85 In January 1995, the FTC reached a consent agreement with American,86 under which American agreed to forgo any such comparative claims.87 Nonetheless, the agreement permitted American to use descriptors to make the "express... representation that [American's] brand is 'low,1 'lower/ or 'lowest' in tar." M.

It was not until 1997 that the FTC asked for comment regarding descriptive terms such as "light** and "ultra lighf per se: "Is there a need for official guidance with respect to the terms used in marketing lower rated cigarettes? If yes, why? If no, why not?**88 The FTC noted that descriptors "appear to be used by the industry to reflect ranges of

G.       Monograph 13

In 1998, the FTC formally requested HHS to further review its testing method and include recommendations on whether the system should be continued and, if so, what specific changes should be made to the testing methodology.90 HHS, in turn, asked NCI to review the evidence of the relationship between machine-measured cigarette smoke and disease risk. The result, released November 27,2001, was Monograph 13, Risks Associated with Smoking Cigarettes with Low Machine-Measured Yields of Tar and Nicotine. Monograph 13 represents *the first step in [HHS's] response to the [FTC's] 1998 request for assistance in developing recommendations to fix" the Cambridge Testing Method.91 Its purpose was to determine whether the scientific evidence showed that the changes in cigarette design over the last SO years resulted in reduced disease risks for smokers.92

Monograph 13 represents a fundamental departure from the scientific and public health community's prior thinking about the health effects of low yield cigarettes. Contrary to the conclusions of the Surgeon General and the IARC - and even the NCI as recently as 1996 - Monograph 13 concludes that "there is no convincing evidence that

changes in cigarette design between 1950 and the mid-1980s have resulted in an important decrease in the disease burden caused by cigarette use either for smokers as a group or for the whole population."93 The Monograph further concludes:

          The FTC Method does not provide consumers with "meaningful information" about the amount of tar and nicotine they wilt receive from a cigarette, either standing alone or in comparison to other brands.94

         "Existing disease risk data do not support making a recommendation that smokers switch cigarette brands. The recommendation that individuals who cannot stop smoking should switch to a low yield cigarette can cause harm if it misleads smokers to postpone serious efforts at cessation "9S

          "Epidemiological and other scientific evidence, including patterns of mortality from smoking-caused diseases, does not indicate a benefit to public health from changes in cigarette design and manufacturing over the last fifty years"96

         For people who switch to low yield brands, "there appears to be complete compensation for nicotine delivery," on a per cigarette basis, "reflecting more intensive smoking of low yield cigarettes."97

In addition, Monograph 13 also notes that, notwithstanding the major modifications in cigarette design between 1950 and 1975,4<there have been few substantive changes toward a further reduction of the toxic and carcinogenic potential of cigarette smoke."98 The Monograph also notes that the levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cigarette

smoke have increased over the years and may be responsible for the rising rates of adenocarcinoma:

Changes in the agricultural, curing, and manufacturing processes of cigarettes have resulted in an increase over the last several decades in the amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cigarette smoke. These changes are considered to have contributed to the increase in adenocarcinoma of the lung observed over the past several decades."

Finally, the Monograph concludes that, in comparison to the smoke generated by the

Cambridge Method, "the inhaled smoke of one cigarette contains 2 to 3 times the amount

of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide and 1.6 to 1.8 times the level of biomarkers for the

major lung carcinogens BaP, and NNK."100

Although PM does not agree with all aspects of Monograph 13, it accepts the

significance of its conclusions regarding low-yield cigarettes.101 PM agrees that smokers

should not assume that lower-yield cigarettes are less harmful than other cigarettes and

that there is no such thing as a safe cigarette. Every cigarette, irrespective of its tar yield,

can cause cancer and other fatal diseases. Quitting is by tar the best alternative for

reducing those risks. PM has publicly made these statements on its website and

elsewhere.

II.       PROPOSED RULEMAKING

Following the issuance of Monograph 13, the FTC indicated that it intends to reevaluate the Cambridge Method. In a November 27,2001 press release, the FTC announced that it will be "working with" HHS "to fix the current cigarette tar and nicotine testing methodology ",03 PM believes that the FTC should take immediate and appropriate action with respect to attempting to improve the method by which tar and nicotine yields are measured. Furthermore, PM submits that Monograph 13*s conclusions compel the FTC, without waiting for the final selection of the appropriate testing method, to consider whether disclaimers should be required to accompany any disclosure of tar and nicotine yields and, if so, what those disclaimers should say.

PM submits the following proposals for rulemaking:

A.       Reconsider the Cambridge Method

Under the current regulatory scheme, which mandates the exclusive use of the Cambridge Method, consumers are being presented with information regarding tar and nicotine yields that members of the scientific and public health community have come to regard as inaccurate. PM proposes that the FTC immediately solicit the opinions of scientists and public health professionals in order to determine whether there is an alternative method of measuring tar and nicotine yields that will more accurately estimate the amount of tar and nicotine actually delivered to the smoker. PM further proposes that, if such an alternative method is not currently in existence, the FTC develop such a method if technically feasible, and PM stands ready to work with the FTC to develop

such a method. Finally, PM proposes that the FTC replace the current Cambridge Method in the event the FTC finds a superior method available. B.       Consider Requiring Additional Information Regardless of the testing methodology adopted, the FTC should require the disclosure of tar and nicotine ratings aiong with the provision of mandatory disclaimers for all low-yield brands. These disclaimers, which should be required for low-yield brands tested under the Cambridge Method or under a new method if one is adopted, should communicate to the public in substance that:

(1)       low-yield cigarettes have not been proven to be less hazardous than other cigarettes and are not a substitute for quitting;

(2)       the amount of tar and nicotine that a smoker obtains from a cigarette depends on how the individual smokes the cigarette;

(3)       that smokers may intake more tar and nicotine than measured by the FTC testing methodology;

(4)       that low tar cigarettes do not make quitting smoking easier than other cigarettes.

Until the FTC determines the appropriate wording and placement for disclaimers, PM intends to continue and expand its efforts to communicate with its consumers on this issue. PM already provides information on this topic on its website and includes the disclaimer, 'The amount of tar and nicotine you inhale will vary depending on how you smoke the cigarette," next to the tar and nicotine disclosure in cigarette advertising. In

C.       Clarify Use of Descriptors

Cigarette manufacturers have historically used descriptors such as "light" and

"ultra light" to differentiate brands on the basis of their machine-measured average tar

and nicotine yields as well as taste. In light of the importance of descriptors in product

differentiation, the FTC should adopt a rule expressly authorizing the industry to continue

to use such descriptors, provided two conditions are met. First, the use of descriptors

should be accompanied by the disclaimers generally described above to minimize

consumer confusion. As long as the public is informed that "light" cigarettes are not

safer than other brands of cigarettes and that tar delivery ultimately depends on the

degree to which a smoker compensates, cigarette companies should be allowed to

continue to use the descriptors to differentiate among brands and provide information

relating to taste. Second, the use of these descriptors should be allowed, provided that

words such as "light" and "ultra light** are used in a uniform fashion and correspond to

ranges of average per cigarette yields as estimated by the Cambridge Method now or

whatever improved method is selected by the FTC in the future. Use of descriptors in a

uniform manner, accompanied by disclaimers, will further the FTC's goal of informing

smokers about the relative yields reported by the testing method, enabling them to make

educated decisions about whether and what brands to smoke.

It is worth emphasizing that the continued use of descriptors is particularly

important given the extent to which consumers associate descriptors with taste

considerations. As Monograph 13 reports, for example, a recent telephone survey found

that the most cited reason for smoking light cigarettes - 81 % of those surveyed - was         '      g

"prefer taste."104 Consumers should be permitted to use descriptors to accommodate taste preferences, so long as they are also informed that the descriptors do not indicate that any cigarette has been proven to be safer or that any cigarette is a suitable alternative to cessation. Accordingly, there is no reason to deny consumers the opportunity to use descriptors to distinguish among brands for reasons other than health.

CONCLUSION

For all the above reasons, we petition the FTC to promulgate rules governing (I) the disclosure of average tar and nicotine yields of cigarette brands, (2) the use of disclaimers with respect to average tar yields and health effects of low yield cigarettes, and (3) the use of descriptors.

ATTACHMENT A

Information for Smokers:

1.  There is no such thing as a safe cigarette.

2.  The terms 'intra Light", "Light" *Medium" and "Mild" are used as descriptors of the strength of taste and flavor. These terms, as well as "low tar," or "lowered tar and nicotine" also serve as a relative indication of the average tar and nicotine yield per cigarette, as measured by a standard government test method.

3.  The tar and nicotine yield numbers are not meant to communicate the amount of tar or nicotine actually inhaled by any smoker, as individuals do not smoke like the machine used in the government test method. The amount of tar and nicotine you inhale will be higher than the stated tar and nicotine yield numbers i for example, you block ventilation holes, inhale more deeply, take more puffs or smoke more cigarettes.

4.  Similarly, if you smoke brands with descriptors such as "Ultra light", light", '"Medium" or "Mild", you may not inhale less tar and nicotine than you would from other brands. It depends on how you smoke.

5.  You should not assume that cigarette brands using descriptors like "Ultra Light", "Light", 'Medium" or 'Tviild" are less harmful than full-flavor cigarette brands or that smoking such cigarette brands will help you quit smoking.

For more than 25 years, the manufacturers in. cooperation with the Commission have tested their cigarettes according to the smoking-maclunejcst method prescribed by the 'Commission and have disclosed the ratings produced by that testing in their .advertising. Since 1987, when the Commission closed its own cigarettejtesting laboratory, the raanu-racturers have continued cigarette testing by (be Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory utilizing the method prescribed by, and subject to the oversight of, the Commission.

the Commission's current test method requires, in pertinent part, that cigarettes be tested by a routine analytical smoking machine according to a 60/35/2 puffing regimen (L e., every 60 seconds, a 35 milliliter puff of two seconds' duration is drawn by the machine).

It seems plausible that supplementing the current FTC test method with the proposed Upper-tier test method would be viewed by smokers as providing more accurate, or more : precise, information about their actual intake of "tar" and nicotine. Smokers may, indeed, conclude that the "high" and "low" end points produced by the proposed two-tier test bracket the range of "likely" smoker intake - a message the Commission's question lb -suggests it intends the dual ratings to convey. In tact, the "high" and "low" end points of r "likelyH intake of "most smokers" for each of the hundreds of cigarette brand styles on the market have not been established, and it may not be possible to develop a test to predict -individual smoker intake that could be used to establish such end points. Moreover, even : if such a predictive test could be developed, it would have to be validated; and such a test,   : once developed and validated, would require smoker testing on a significant scale  not in  . laboratory settings, but in real-worM settings ~ to establish "highland "low" end points of "likely" intake for "most smokers" for each of the hundreds of brand styles on the market. In the absence of such testing, there would be no scientific basis for viewing the end points   : -as bracketing "likely" smoker intake for any brand style.

Moreover, as disenssed in Appendix A, even taking into account the factors that tender the data erode and imprecise, the incorporation of a partial veat-blocttng paatCMtar in nicotiDft-tes|mg requirements recently prescribed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health did not appreciably alter the relative ranking of cigarettes produced by the current FTC test method for the cigarettes that woe tested pursuant to those requirements.

11 We urge the Commission to discourage (and, if possible, prevent) individual states from imposing their own cigarette testing and reporting requirements on manufacturers. To date, Massachusetts has already required the manufacturers to submit nicotine yield data for samples of cigarettes sold in Massachusetts, pursuant to testing requirements prescribed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health that differ significantly from the current and proposed FTC test methods. Hie Texas Department of Health has also issued proposed roles requiring the manufacturers to submit nicotine yield data for samples of cigarettes sold in Texas, pursuant to requirements similar to those prescribed by Massachusetts. In addition, as detailed in Appendix 8, as of February 4,1998, bills were pending in at least eight other states (Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey and New York) mat would similarly require the manufacturers to submit nicotine yield data for cigarettes sold in those states, under testing requirements to be prescribed by the health department in each stare,        ...----     "                 "

I.        CIGARETTE TESTING METHODOLOGY

/.       The Proposed New Testing Methodology

a.       What effect, if any, art the dual ratings that -would be provided by the Commission's proposed two-tier test method likely to have on consumers' purchases of ^cigarettes and/or their smoking behavior? Will this mjbrmathn affect smoking intensity, -brand choice, and/or the decision whether to quit smoking, and if so, how?

The manufacturers do not know how the dual ratings produced by the Commission's proposed two-tier test would be perceived, and therefore cannot predict how they might affect consumer behavior. Extensive consumer research would be needed, at a Tntntimim, to determine the likely effects of the proposed dual-rating system on consumer behavior. It seems likely that, at least initially, the dual ratings would generate consumer confusion. Beyond that, one can only speculate about the effects.of the proposed dual ratings on consumer behavior.             .        _          -.                   &

Under the current testing system, each cigarette brand style has a single set of "tar".

- and nicotine ratings that clearly distinguish it from all other brand styles with different" tar" and nicotine ratings. By contrast, the dual ratings produced by the proposed two-tier test would produce, for each brand style, two sets of "tar" and nicotine ratings  one produced by the current FTC test method, and another produced by the proposed second test. As a result, the ratings for each brand style would overlap with the ratings for other brand styles.   -

b.       Ifthe proposal for testing all cigarettes under the same two sets of parameters is adopted, and if the parameters incorporated in the Commission's test method are intended to produce yields covering the range likely to be experienced by most smokers, are the ' proposed parameters appropriate? Wry or why not? If not, what parameters would be ~ More appropriate and why?

1.       The "range" of actual smoker Intake for particular cigarette brand styles has not been established.                                                  ^----------

The "range" of "likely" intakeof "tar" and nicotine by "most smokers" for particular cigarette brand styles has not been established. As discussed above, a predictive test that could be used to establish such a range of actual smoker intake does not exist; such a test may not be possible to develop; assuming that such a test could be developed, it would then need to be validated; and, if such a test could be developed and validated, establishing the ; range of "likely" smoker intake for each of the hundreds of cigarette brand styles on the ; market would be a significant undertaking. Without extensive human testing, tt could not be said definitively that the particular end points produced by die proposed two-tier test (or any two-tier test) would bracket the amount of "tar" and nicotine "likely" to be inhaled by "most smokers" of any particular brand style, or would bracket the range of "likely" intake for different brand styles with equalprecision.

In the absence of such testing, all that can be said with confidence about the pro^setftwo-tier test is mat the "high" and "low" yield end points will be lower for lower- _^_

proposed two-tier test suggests actual toman intake ranges to smokers - and it seems

-inevitable that it would - the addition of the upper-tier number could be misleading to

consumers.                                                                   -      -"" "

2.      Reliance on smoking machine yields as surrogates for smoker intake is misconceived.

The danger in characterizing the proposed two-tier test as a surrogate for smoker intake at the "low" and "high" end points is that the tests would be legitimized as predictors. of smoking behavior and smoke intake. But, as the Commission has repeatedly emphasized, routine analytical smoking machine tests are incapable of predicting smoker behavior or intake.

Routine analytical smoking machines cannot predict intake for any individual ox group of individuals. Such a smoking machine can capture "tar" and nicotine from a cigarette on ti&pad inserted in the machine, but the amount of "tar" and nicotine captured

individual smoker draws into his or her mouth, and the amount of "tar" and nicotine that

any individual smoker draws into his or her mouth cannot be equated with the amount of

"tar" and nicotine that he or she inhaks and does not exhale.

The purpose of routine analytical smoking machine testing, the Commission

explained, "is not to determine the amount of tar and nicotine inhaled by any human

smoker, but rather to determine the amount of tar and nicotine generated when a cigarette

is smoked by a [smoking] machine in accordance with the prescribed method/^

Explaining the Commission's long-held view, the Associate Director of the Advertising

Practices Division has stated:

r -From the outset, the [FTCJ testing was intended to obtain uniform, standardized data aboutthe tar and nicotine yield ofmainstream cigarette smoke, not to replicate actual human smoking. The Commission recognized that individual smoking behavior was Just that  too individual to gauge what a hypothetical 'average' smoker would get from any particular cigarette.^

From the beginning, the Commission stressed that no testing method could predict

actual deliveries to individual smolcers. In announcing on August 1,1967, the completion

of trial tests by its laboratory, the Commission made its position clear:

No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either 'right* or wrong.1 The Commission considers it most important that the test results

The Commission's characterization of its proposed, two-tier test as an attempt to bracket "likely" intake by "most smokers" for a particular brand style appears to reflect a recognition that smoking machines cannot predict the "average1' yield to the "average" smoker. Reliance on smoking machines to produce "low" and "high1' end points for each brand style is similarly misconceived, however, because it still depends on smoking machines to predict "average" intake at the "low" and "high" end points of "likely" human intake (i.e., it depends on the machines to predict that "most smokers * ate unlikely to experience yields outside of the range bracketed by the end points).

The Commission has long recognized that a standardized testing method that

replicates actual average human smoking is not possible because human smoking conditions

affecting intake are simply too variable and are beyond the ability of a simple machine

No two human smokers smoke in the same way. No individual smoker always smokes in the same fashion. The speed at which one smokes varies both among smokers, and usually also varies with the same individual under different circumstances even within the same day. Some take long puffs (or draws); some take short puf&. That variation affects the tar and nicotine quantity in the smoke generated.

Even with the same type of cigarette, individual smokers take a different number of puffs per cigarette depending upon the circumstances. When concentrating, or talking, the number of puffs is usually less. When listening, or required to listen to aiK)therpcT5CtalkhTg, the nurnber of fulfils ; per cigarette, as well as the duration of each purl, usually increases.

viewing a television program. The number of puffs and puff duration (as well as butt length) will vary according to emotional stated

The Commission also recognized other basic differences between individual smokers:

Some smokers customarily put their cigarettes down in an ashtray where they bum between puffs; other smokers constantly hold cigarettes in their mouths; others holdmem betweentheir fingers.-^

-The Commission has further noted:                                 

          The Cambridge Filter Method does not and cannot measure these many varia-

tfons in human smoking habits. It does not measure tar or nicotine in the smoke generated whUe the cigaiiette is not being puffed. It does not measure all of the tar and nicotine in any cigarette, but only that in the smoke drawn in the standardized machine smoking according to the prescribed method. Thus, the purpose of testing is not to determine the amount af tar and nicotine inhaled by any human smoker, but rather to determine the amount of tar and nicotine generated -when a cigarette is smoked by machine in accordance with the prescribed method.**

Given tbe range and variability of individual smoking behavior, the Commission

concluded that a testing method purportedly based on some spurious notion of "average"

smoker behavior could actually mislead the public:

[TJhe testing method should not be considered defective because it docs not rely on 'averages.' There are too many variables as to both smokers and smoking conditions for any average to be meaningful. Test results phrased in terms of an 'average' smoker could be misleading to the public, because a smoker has no way of knowing how closely his smoking habits conform to those of the purportedly 'average* smoker.*?

 15 -Toe Commission's choice of testing methods, therefore, expressly took into account the risk that it would be misleading and inappropriate to speak of an "average" smoker:

It should be emphasized that the Cambridge Filter Method itself did not purport to duplicate an 'average' smoker. Rather, it was an amalgam of many choices - some of them arbitrary. For example, the temperature and humidity specified in that Method were not determined by reference to the 'average' temperature or the 'average' humidity at which people smoke cigarettes. There is no human smoker who smokes, and no cigarette that is smoked, under conditions that precisely duplicate either the Cambridge Filter Method in its original form or as modified by the Commission (prior to its adoption]. Thus, to reiterate, the uniform method determined by the Commission has as its purpose measurement of the tar and nicotine generated by cigarettes when smoked according to that procedure.-^

As Dr. Michael Borgerding, a Master Chemist at RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company, stated in a 1997 article, routine analytical smoking machines "cannot replicate actual fnvman smoking behavior. These smoking machines are designed to take uniformly shaped puffs of a precisely set volume and duration ... at a constant frequency. "& Adding an upper tier to the FTC test method would ensure only that a smoking TTiaf*WT" will take uniformly shaped puffs at another arbitrary constant puff volume, puff duration, and inteipuff interval.

Smoking machines also cannot replicate human behavior because they cannot replicate the complicated process of smoke inhalation and exhalation. For example, smokers typically do not inhale all of the smoke that they draw from the cigarette. A smoker draws mainstream smoke into his or her moum by r^tffiiig on the lit cigarette. Toe design of the cigarette, including tobacco types, weight, filtration and ventilation, along with

-16-the size, shape and duration of the puff, determine the amount of the smoke that a smoker takes into his or her mouth in any particular puff.   After drawing a puff, bat before : inhaling, a smoker may mix the smoke with air in his or ber mouth, and during the mixing, some of the smoke can escape into the air of me room. Indeed, smokers who do not inhale at all allow all of the smoke to escape into the room air.

No smoke similarly escapes from the smoking machine.-   Moreover, unlike a smoker, a smoking machine does not exhale before (or after) inhaling. Thus, even if a smoking machine pad captured the same amount of "tar" and nicotine as the amount   . received in die mouth of a smoker from a particular puff, that amount may not be the same

as the .amount of "tar" and nicotine inhaled and not exhaled by (he smoker.

Di. L.T. Kozlowski, who has published a number of articles discussing the FTC

testing method^ has reiterated the Commission's 1967 position (hat any testing method

designed to produce standard yield figures necessarily has significant limitations:

Even if a valid or accurate estimate of average smoking behavior is attainable, it does not follow that it would be sufficiently reliable or precise to give many smokers information about their own idiosyncratic tar and nicotine yields from a given brand. The ideal average smoker may always be an inadequate stand-in for individual smokers; an average tells you about the behavior of other members of the population to the extent that the other members of the population cluster in close proximity to the average. . .. The variability of human smoking behavior is Jorge enough that standard yields do not. an their awn, provide a good indication of actual yields to individual smokers!

Recent research confirmsthat hnman smoking behavior is not constant from puff to puff u the smoker smokes a cjgawtte, from eigarette to eigarette for a particular asuker, or from smoker to smoker. In a 1995 study. Reeves and Dixon reported that a person's smoking behavior varies puff by puff while smoking a single cigarette, due to changes in tobacco rod filtration efficiency during smoking.^ Zacny and Stitzcr have stated that ' n[i]nidally, smokers take larger and longer puffs from the cigarette,, but as ihey smoke down mc rod, the puffs get shorter and smajlcr. Interpuff intervals [Le.t the interval between the end of one puff and the beginning of another puff] are shortest at the beginning of the cigarette and longest near the end of the cigarette. "S'

The variability of smoking behaviors among individuals is illustrated in a recent study by Bentrovato and colleagues, who in 1995 reported results from their study of smoke yields obtained by 13 Canadian smokers, each smoking the same commercial king size filtered brand.^ All of the smokers in the study had been smoking this same brand for at least 3 years.

As the Commission has stated, "within fairly wide limits, no one [test] method can be said to be either 'right* or 'wrong. '"^ The parameters of the proposed second test -as the Commission noted in its proposal - are within the range of human puffing behavior reported in the studies that were cited in the 1988 Surgeon General's report.-Specifically, the Commission's proposed lower-tier and upper-tier puff volumes (35 milliliters and 55 milliliters) fall within the reported range of human puff volumes (21 to 66 milliliters), and the Commission's proposed lower-tier and upper-tier interpuff intervals (60 and 30 seconds) fall within the reported range of interpuff intervals (18 to 64 seconds).

Bentrovato and colleagues, in the study discussed above, gathered data on die average smoking parameters of 13 Canadians smoking a single brand - their own  in the laboratory. To generate the average yield that each smoker might receive in his or her mouth, the researchers calibrated a specially designed smoking machine to reflect the smoking parameters of each of the 13 smokers. The standard of comparison was the ISO smoking machine test method, whose parameters ate similarjto the FTC test method. The researchers found mat:                                                          _

Duplicated smoke deliveries ? . . showed a wide range of values. However, the average values obtained for tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide were relatively close to the machine derived [It, ISO standard) deliveries with respectively 17%, 5% and 1496 higher values.^                                            ,

By contrast, as reported to the Commission, it appears that the Commission's

proposed upper-tier test parameters would produce smoking machine yields about 100%

higher than the current FTC test parameters.- Thus, the research would suggest that the

proposed upper-tier testing method is likely to overstate the yields that a smoker typically

would receive in his or her mouth.

c. Should the butt length specified in the current FTC test method  that cigarettes be smoked to a length of 23 millimeters or to 3 millimeters beyond rhe filter and overwrap, whichever is longer  be changed? Is there evidence that smokers smoke more than 3 millimeters beyond the end of the overwrap ? If so, what is the effect of that behavior in terms of the number of puffs they get from their cigarette?

1.       The manufacturers are aware of no sound reason to alter the butt length specified in the current FTC method.

The manufacturers arc aware of no sound reason to after the butt length specified in the current FTC method. like the other parameters* the specified butt length is intended to provide a standard procedure for testing to rank brands. Even assuming that the butt length specified in the FTC test method was intended to reflca human behavior, there is no reliable scientific basis for concluding that the bun length specified by the FTC method is too short or too long when compared with rhe length of the butt typically left when a U.S. "smoker has finished a cigarette.

There is some evidence from other countries that the standi test-meuiod butt length may be shorter than the lengm of the butt generally left by smokers. In his 1988 Report, Sir Peter Froggatt, Chairman of the U.K. Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and - Health stated *[r]eponsd studies mvestigatffig the average butt length left by smokers have indicated that smokers have a tendency to discard their cigarette leaving a longer butt than used in the standard machine procedure/2^ In the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") smoking method used in the U.K. and throughout Europe, the butt length for uafilteted cigarettes is 23 millimeters, and for filtered cigarettes, overwrap plus

3.       The evidence does not indicate that pec^Ie smoke the overwrap.

Some nave suggested that the method for testing "tar" and nicotine yields should require that cigarettes be smoked to a butt length shorter than 23 millimeters, or overwrap plus three millimeters (whichever is longer), because ~ they claim - people smoke me overwrap.- There is no scientific support for the contention that people typically smoke me overwrap, and the possibility that a small number of people may do so is not a sufficient reason to change me butt length, specified in the FTC testing method.

A preliminary observational study by Grunberg, et al. (which was conducted in 1985 and was based on data collected by the Commission from 1962 through 1979) assumed  incorrectly - that people smoke the overwrap.22' The authors, however, did not provide any evidence that smokers actually do smoke the overwrap portion of the paper. Although it may be hypothetically possible to smoke the overwrap, the smoke generated from the burning tipping paper is considered unpalatable. There is no reason to alter the butt length parameter specified in the FTC method.

4.       There Is no demonstrated relationship between butt length and number of puffs.

Regardless of the butt length chosen for machine smoking, the butt length bears no demonstrated relationship to the number of puffs that a smoker will take on a cigarette. Smokers may take more or fewer puffs than the machine does, and a smoker's puff number can vary from cigarette to cigarette.                           ...._

For a typical 85 millimeter cigarette with 25 percent air dilution mat yields about 10 milligrams of "tar" under the FTC testing method, there are about eight puffs per cigarette under the current FTC testing method. The same cigarette smoked under the Commission's proposed upper-tier method - a 55 milliliter purl every 30 seconds - gives about 11 puffs. Assuming that there are 49 millimeters of tobacco rod available for smoking and a umfbnn burn rate, a simple calculation shews mat about 6.1 millimeters of tobacco rod would be consumed during the one-minute puffing cycle (puff and smolder) under FTC's current method. Under the proposed upper-tier method, about 4.5 millimeters of the tobacco rod would be consumed per puffing cycle, again assuming uniform burning down the rod.

In either case, smoking beyond the standard butt length through the overwrap would

r

yield no more man one additional puff, and quite possibly no puff at all if the previous puff occurred close to the machine cutoff mark on the tobacco rod.

d. What effect, if any, would reducing the sample size from 200 to 50 cigarettes, as proposed, have on both the reliability and the repUcability of the machine yield estimates? tf there is an effect on reliability, does thefict that consumers would be given dual ratings, rather than a unitary rating, lessen the importance of that reduction?

1.        Tbe sample size should be maintained to preserve historical continuity.

Although, the manufacturers make every effort to standardize their brands, as an - agricultural product tobacco differs over time and from place to place. Therefore, cigarettes have some variation in "tar" and nicotine. Tbe current sample size should be retained to ensure that tbe numbers generated by the test arc an accurate representation of the brand-style for which they are to be published. As noted above, and as the Commission has stated, it is important to "preserve the historical continuity of the existing test method, and thus permit long term trends in ratings to be identified. *&

2.        Decreasing the sample size could affect the representativeness of the sample.

Currently, the Tobacco Institute Testing Laboratory purchases 100 samples of each brand style according to a validated sampling method. Reducing the sample size from 100 to 50 could call into question tbe representativeness of the sample, and the new sampling method would need to be validated.

There is no good reason to decrease the cunent sample size and risk making the sample less representative.22'  To preserve the cunent representativeness of the sample,

asd avoid the seed for validating a new sampling method, the sample size should be

maintained at 100 cigarettes per variety tested.

e. Can the machines preserttty used w smoke tigcirmespujww to the FTC test method operate under the parameters in the Commission '$ proposed new protocol? If not, could they be modified to operate wider those parameters or would new machines have to be purchased? What testing would be necessary to ensure the validity of the proposed modifications to the test method - that is* to ensure that the revised protocol will produce highly reliable and repUcdbU results? How long would such validation take?

Development of a sound and properly validated testing method for Hie proposed

upper tier would take considerable tone and effort, and would require consideration of the

technical issues highlighted below.  As discussed in more detail below, testing cigarettes

under both the existing and the proposed new test method  including the development of

a protocol for the upper-tier test method - would also be tnne-ccmsuming and require a

substantial commitment of resources.^

1. The machines presently used to smoke cigarettes pursuant to the Qmtmission's testing method cannot operate under the parameters in the proposed upper-tier regimen without substantial modification.

The cigarette companies and the 7TTL currently use the Filtrona model number SM

330 smoking machine or a substantially similar machine for conducting "tar" and nicotine

testing according to the FTC method.  The SM 350 has a long history as a robust and

reliable piece of equipment. The smoking machine's robustness is demonstrated each year

by the TtTLT which uses only two SM 350's to smoke over 50,000 cigarettes and produce

yield data for over S20 cigarette brand styles.

- Operating the SM 350 under the parameters intbe Commission's proposed upper-tier test method is not simply a matter of modifying the conuiia^                          Like pressing

down on the gas pedal of a car to make it go raster, or adjusting a thermostat to make a

-room warmer. The SM 350 itself would have to be modified in a number of respects in order to operate under the parameters in the Commission's proposed upper-tier test method. Those modifications would result, for all practical purposes, in the construction of a new machine. The modifications would involve, inter alia, changes in Cambridge filter capacity, syringe volume, motor stroke length, and flow-rate instrumentation.^

The machine as modified would have its own strengths and weaknesses, which would have to be evaluated on their own merits without reference to the existing SM 350. A modified smoking machine used to generate official yields for FTC reporting would have

& Filter capacity, hiereasing the puff volume to 55 mfflaiten awl me puff frequency to once every 30 seconds would essentially double the quantities of "tar" and nicotine that a single Cambridge filler must capture. In some instances, the filter may become saturated, and some "tar" and nicotine may break through the filter. To avoid filter "break through," cither a modified filter would have to be used, or fewer cigarettes would have to be smoked per test.

Syringe volume. The SM 350 is equipped with 50 milliliter syringes that are capable of drawing 35 milliliter puffs from each cigarette as specified by die current FTC testing method. Larger syringes are necessary for the upper-tier test. Once syringes are changed and set up, it is neither advisable nor practical to switch the twenty syringes back and forth on a routine basis.

Motor stroke length. As Is reo^uM for settmgin> the current

adjustment is required to assure proper puff volumes. This contributes to the non-practicality of       to

switching syringes on a routine basis.                                                                                            ^

; Since the testing machines currently in use are not readily convertible to different

testing parameters, it could take a significant amount of time and effort to convert and

reconvert the machines between me two proposed testing regimes if the same machines were

to be used for both tests. This is of particular importance for both the manufacturers and   .

TTTL, which probably would not be able to use their existing machines to test cigarettes

imder both the existing and the proposed new methods.

In light of the availability of a "multiplier* mat can be used to closely approximate

the results that actual testing under the upper-tier test would produce - without requiring

the conversion of tbe SM 350 or the validation of testing using a converted smoicing

machine  requiring the manufacturers to convert the SM 350's and validate testing using

the converted machines would not be justified.

2,      Unlike a "multiplier," a new protocol would require an extensive period of validation to produce "highly reliable and replieaolt results.11

The only way to ensure that results are "h%hly reliable and icplicable" is to

proposed upper-tier testing method through a formal validation process.   Once such a

process is completed, a new method would be ready for day-to-day application in the

laboratory.    The complex and tune<onsuming nature of this process reinforces the;-------

Since the "multiplier'' approach does not require day-to-day testing, an experiment (albeit     ft

w

an extensive experiment) is appropriate to determine the multiplier rather than an extensive'     j method, validation process.   Also, if upper-tier citings are generated by means of a

nmltiplier from the FTC yield figures, those ratings would be based on results obtained from a method that in effect, has already been validated.-

Abseat the use of a multiplier, an extensive method validation process would be required. In the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, Pub. L 103-43,  1301, 107 Stat. 122, Congress instructed the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ("NIEHS") to cstefcliah criteria for the validation and,regulatory acceptance of ..alternative testing methods. The NIEHS convened the Inter-Agency Coordinating Comrnittee on The Validation of Alternative Methods ("ICCVAM").^ Although the ICCVAM focused on validation of testing methodologies in the field of toxicology, the validation criteria that the ICCVAM proposed are applicable to any validation process.

In its report, the ICCVAM described validation as "the process, by which the reliability and relevance of a test method are evaluated for the purpose of supporting a specific use."^ The ICCVAM defined "reliability11 as a "measure..of Joe degree to which

Regardless of who perfbnns the qyersigbt function, the validation process would have to comply with any special requirements that the overseer might impose.

mathematical equations or "multipliers."   This has beeu demonstrated for cigarettes

currently sold in the U.S. by an experiment conducted during 1997 that has been reported

manufacturers to determine the general relationship between (a) smote yields when

cigarettes are smoked according to the proposed upper-tier testing method with a puff

volume of 55 milliliters and a puff frequency of one every 30 seconds (the "55/30/2

method") and (b) smoke yields when cigarettes are smoked with the standard FTC method

The laboratories each tested 50 different cigarettes: 46 commercial brand styles and four University of Kentucky Reference cigarettes.^' The laboratory of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which coordinated the experiment, supplied each laboratory with five commercial brand styles from a single purchase. Each laboratory chose independently the remaining 41 commercial brands to be tested. The laboratories were uistructfid to select brand styles that would provide a comprehensive insight into the smoke yields of cigarettes that currently are sold in the marketplace. Because the laboratories chose brands independently, there was some dnplication among the brands tested. The laboratories tested a total of 126 commercial brands, representing a broadiange of cigarette lengths, Circumferences, filter types, price tiers, pack styles, menthol inclusion and FTC tar" yields

The four laboratories reported 1,840 results (each laboratory reported 10 ports each of 46 commercial brand styles times four companies). Regression analysis demonstrated that "tar," nicotine and carbon monoxide ("CO") data from the two puffing regimens can be related by quadratic functions, The following functions can be used to predict yields for cigarettes smoked under me 55/30/2 method from standard FTC smoke yield data:

day-to-day in many different laboratories, and would serve the Commission's purpose.

The nianafacturers recognize that the use of a mult^licr (or, indeed, the existing test

method itself) cannot automatically be assumed to be appropriate in the case of cigarettes

with design parameters that fall outside of the wide range of design parameters of the

cigarettes that were used to establish the quadratic equation proposed by the manufacturers

to the Commission,  Until cigarettes with alternative design parameters proliferate, these

instances should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

g. Should the cigarette manufacturers be permitted to use the mathematical equations they submitted to the Commission to calculate the ratings thai would be produced by testing under the proposed upper-tier parameters? Why or why not? If the industry is permitted to use such mathematical equations, should it continue to use 100 cigarettes, rather than 50, to determine the lower-tier ratings? Why or why not?

__. 1. The manufacturers should be permitted to use the mathematical equations they have submitted to calculate the ratings that would be produced by testing under the proposed upper-tier parameters.

_       The manufacturers are not comdnced that asecor4numbex is warranted.   If,

however, a second number is required, they strongly support use of the inathematical

equations submitted to the Commission to calculate the ratings mat would be produced by

testing under the proposed, upper-tier parameters.   In an experiment conducted in four

different laboratories, the mathematical equations were carefully evaluated and found to be

viable.  For a wide range of cigarette brand styles, the scientists found good agreement

between measured values and values predicted by empirically derived equations. Urns, the,

equations will serve the purpose that they were intended to serve.

-39-There arc at least two additional reasons why the equations submitted by the manufacturers should be used to generate the ratings sought to be produced by the upper-tier testing method. First, as discussed, implementation of a two-tier testing system in which the upper-tier ratings were produced in the laboratory on smoking machines would be time-consuming and costly, while the time and cost associated with generating upper-tier results by means of an equation would be comparatively small.^ Second, the use of an equation to generate the upper-tier results would eliminate the need to validate the protocol for the 55/30/2 testing method, a process that could require two or more years and countless hours of labor. Although the current FTC testing method has never undergone a formal validation process, it has been validated for the purpose it was designed to serve through 30 years of mteriaboratory use. This history of use serves as "de facto validation":

Many test methods currently accepted by Federal agencies have been considered validated based on their history of use by the scientific community, even though their operational characteristics (e.g., reproducibility and predictivity) may not have been fully established at the time of adoption. Calculation of current performance using existing data is necessary so that the performance of new or revised methods can be compared to the existing method.^

in addition, the  manufacturers and. the TTTL conduct semi-annual  "round-robin"

mteriaboratory tests to ensure the reproducibility of results that are raminxraieated to FTC.

Consequently, if upper-tier ratings were generated by means of an equation premised on

&     The costs associated with performing an experiment every five years to reconfirm the validity

of the equations would be substantial. Nevertheless, the costs would not approach the annual costs ~ ~~     kr

yfeld figures from the existing FTC test method, those ratings would be based on results obtained from a method that, as a practical matter, already had been, validated over time,

2. If the manufacturers are permitted to use a mathematical equation to generate the upper-tier results, a 100-cigarette sample should be used to generate the lower-tier results.

As discussed, reducing the sample size from 100 cigarettes to 50 cigarettes could

have a negative impact on the reliability of the current FTC testing method. See answer to

question 1(d).  Maintaining the current sample size would avoid that potential problem,

avoid the need for validation, and ensure historical continuity.

k How much would the proposed two-tier testing system cost the cigarette industry to implement as compared to the current system? How much would The proposed two-tier testing system cost the cigarette industry to implement if 100 cigarettes, rather than 50, were smoked under each test condition? How much would the proposed revisions to the test method cost the industry to implement if mathematical equations were used to generate the upper-tier ratings?

1. The cost of implementing a two-tier system would be high if results for the upper tier must be generated in the laboratory.

The greatest "costs" of implementing a two-tier system are costs in time - the time it would take to develop and validate the upper-tier test method, and the time it would take to conduct the second set of tests using the upper-tier test method, once developed and validated.                                                         ._...__.          r

The dollar costs of implementing the upper-tier test method are impossible to quantify with any confidence. The manufacturers are able to offer, as very preliminary estimates, that implementation of the upper-tier method would entail, for them,

and validation, or costs to TITL or any other manafectarcrsv      ....

2.       The cost advantages associated with reducing the sample size would not be significant.

Reducing the sample size from 100 to 50 would not affect the capital costs associated with implementing an upper-tier method of laboratory testing. Reducing the sample size might somewhat reduce the ongoing annual costs of each tid of testing by both TITL and the manufacturers. Fewer hours might be spent testing 50 cigarettes than are spent testing 100. However, foe cost of testing 100 cigarettes wing two methods - i.e., 50 cigarettes with the current FTC method and 50 with the 55/30/2 method - would not be the same as me cost of testing 100 cigarettes using one method. Compared to the high costs associated with establishing and maintaining a second laboratory at the TTIL and a second or expanded laboratory at each manufacturing location dedicated to the upper-tier method, any cost reductions that might be associated with reducing the sample size would be relatively insignificant.                                                                     _

Reducing the sample size also may not affect the ongoing costs, Round-robin testing conducted by the TTTL and the manufacturers uses a sample size of 100 cigaicttes. Even if the manufacturers reduced the sample size, there is no reason to believe that a 50 percent reduction in sample size would lead to a 50 percent reduction in ongoing annual costs. With

The manufacturers estimate that the costs associated with a single experiment to reconfirm the equations for predicting yields at the upper tier could be as much as $100,000 to $150,000 per company.

2.       Alternative Options For Revising the Test Method

a. Should the upper Her of the two-tier test method reflect the tendencies of smokers of lower rated and heavily aerated (i.e., vented) cigarettes to smoke more intensively (by taxing more puffs, biggerpuffs, etc.) or to block some or all of 'the ventilation holes while smoking? If so, how should the test protocol be modified in order to obtain tar and nicotine ratings that would accuratefy reflect the effect of these and other forms of compensatory smoking behavior? Would ratings generated by.such a test protocol affect smoking'intensity, brand choice, and/or the decision whether to quit smoking, and if so, how?

1.      Hie testing protocol should not be modified to reflect "compensatory" smoking.

As the Commission's question reflects* die hypothesized phenomenon called "compensatory smoking" is often viewed as a collection of discrete,behaviors - e.g., puff size, puff duration, puff frequency, and (possibly) vent-blocking. The manufacturers submit that the use of such behaviors to define 'compensatory smoking" is misconceived because everyday smoking involves variability in each of these behaviors, and determining empirically when such behaviors constitute "compensation'' rather than normal variability in everyday.smokins is problematic.

Even if such behaviors were appropriate markers of "compensatory smoking/ current knowledge about these behaviors is too sparse to be usable tor modeling purposes;

and even if sufficient data existed to model those behaviors, routine analytical smoking ;      K)

smoKing-macftme testing method of which we are aware can serve is "to determine the

amount of tar and nicotine generated when a cigarette is smoked by wweWmt in accordance

with the prescribed method.''^

2.      The evidence suggests that any compensation that may occur is partial and may be of limited duration.

The Commission .asks whether all or most smokers of lower-rated and more heavily aerated cigarettes "compensate" for the lower yields by altering their puffing behavior in order ftvinerease the yield.2' The evidence in support of such a phenomenon, however, is highly equivocal. In fact, studies repeatedly have shown that "tar" and nicotine intake decreases when a smoker shifts to a cigarette with a lower FTC reported yield. Moreover, to the extent that compensation occurs, all available evidence iadicates that it is not complete and it may be a phenomenon of limited duration. More important, the manufacturers are unaware of cvidencejn the ihtera|cre_jsj^gestmg that it is possible to determine any ^average" amount of compensation applicable to M smokers (or any given subset) that would be an essential prerequisite to any meaningful attempt to adjust the proposed upper-tier test to reflect such behavior. In short, there does not appear to be a scientifically valid basis to modify the upper-tier test in response to a phenomenon of unknown applicability across the spectrum of smokers.                  .*-_     =      _

Before reviewing the evidence, it may be useful to place the discussion of "compensation" in perspective. Compensation generally is taken to mean increasing puff f

count or puff volume on a consistent and sustained basis in response to a change from

higher-yield to lower-yield cigarettes. However, everyday smoking involves variability in

the same discrete smoking behaviors and distinguishing between such everyday variability

and compensation is problematic. In order to understand the phenomenon of compensation,

it is important to focus on biological measures of human intake, not smoking behaviors.

Limited research has been conducted to date to determine actual smoker intake and what

research has been conducted has not been replicated in multiple laboratories. The methods

currently in use to conduct such research are not suitable for standardized testing, and are

limited to estimating nicotine intake and not "tar" intake. In addition, the results of these

studies do not, in any way, predict the likely intake of other smokers or even of the same

smokers in other environments or under other circumstances.

        The most extensive studies to date have tended to find direct and linear relationships between actual intake and FTC method yield.

In 1988, Zacny and Stirrer conducted a biand-switching study in which smokers were switched from their usual brand of cigarettes to a brand with a higher or lower yield (measured by the FTC method) in order to determine any changes in the levels of blood serum cotinine. and other biomatfeers.2' Zacny and Su'teer reported that the cotminc levels in the smokers of ultra-low-yield cigarette were significantly lower than the levels in smokers of medium-yield cigarettes, and mat the cotinine levels in the smokers of low-yield cigarettes were significantly lower than the levels in smokers of high-yield cigarettes* Although the authors thought that there had been some compensation, they concluded that "nicotine, cotinine and CO exposure levels from commercial brand cigarettes are related in an orderly manner to cigarette yield. *&

Byrd and others investigated the inter-individual variation of nicotine intake of 72 smokers who smoked ad libitum their usual brand cigarette.^ Nicotine and some of its metabolites were determined in 24-hour urine samples for smokers of brands with FTC method yields from 0.1 to 1.2 milligrams of nicotine per cigarette. The correlation between nicotine absorbed and FTC nicotine yield was positive and statistically significant, though weak. These data show that, on average, compensation occurs for smokers of low yield cigarettes but is incomplete.

Benowitz and Heimingfield, in an editorial, have suggested that n[t]he variation in intake [of nicotine] per cigarette is considerable . . . ranging from 0.3 to 3.2 mg . . . depending on how the cigarette is smoked."- Thus, they suggested that a person Who smokes a cigarette that typically delivers about one milligram of nicotine could increase the yield of that cigarette to 3.2 milligrams - a result that is 320 percent of the stated yield. In fact, this claim is based on data that are too limited to support any general conclusions.

Benowitz and Henmngfield cited two articles by Benowitz and colleagues as the sole support for their 320-percenr figure. One of those studies reported that, under certain test

conditions, the nicotine derived by a group of smokers ranged from one-third to VA times

the yields derived by the FTC method.-  Quite apart from the fact that this range simply

brackets the FTC-predicted yield, the 1%-thnes maximum is less than half the 320-percent

figure claimed by Benowitz and Henningfield.

The second article did state that one person derived 3.2 milligrams of nicotine from

a single cigarette with an FTC yield of one milligram. Other smokers apparently derived

as little as 0.37 milligrams from tbe one milligram cigarette mat they were given to smoke.

But in tbe report on mat study, Benowitz acknowledged mat tbe conditions of the study were

extremely artificial and probably resulted in an excessive amqtmt of compensation:

It is likely that the unusually high level of nicotine intake in our subjects reflects the fact that the subjects (who had not smoked for the previous 10 to 12 hours) knew that they could smoke only one or two cigarettes during the next 12 hours. When access to cigarettes is restricted, cigarette smokers can increase mekper-cigarette smoke intake by threefold or greater. Presumably mis is what was occurring in our cigarette-deprived volunteers, despite instructions to smoke naturally, to addition, our subjects smoked these cigarettes through a cigarette holder (part of the smoke dosimeter), which is an unnatural way io smoke and could have influenced smoking behavior and nicotine intake. Effects of tobacco arjstinence, eiu^ before testmger anticipated after testing, and the use of cigarette holders on smoking behavior should be considered by other investigators.^

       Recent review articles indicate that "tar" and nicotine intake decreases when people switch to cigarettes with lower FTC reported yields.

An analysis of the recent literature confirms that FTC reported deliveries are related

to relative nicotine intake. In a recent meta-analysis of 18 brand-switching studies, Scherer

Scheier and Kins reported a weighted average CI of 0-38. This CI suggests that while many study subjects altered their smoking behavior to compensate upon switching to lower-yield brands, they did not compensate sufficiently to bring their intake of "tar! and nicotjne to the level obtained while smoking their prior higher-yield cigarettes.

A 1996 review of brand-switching experiments conducted for the NCI Expert Committee on the FTC Cigarette Test Method reached a similar conclusion. Kozlowski and Pillitteri presented a chart describing the results of six brand-switching studies. The largest study reported 12 percent compensation for smokers who were switched from their own brands to brands with a lower-reported yield. Three other studies reported compensation rates in the 30-percent range. The smallest study showed a compensation rate of 49 percent and the renaming study showed a rate of 62 percent. It appears that intake was determined on the basis of plasma nicotine or plasma cotimnc, depending on what was available.

A1996 review by Pritchard and Robinson fixamfncd blood cotmine data fiom eight

studies involving smokers who, instead of being subjected to a brand-switching experiment

in the laboratory, had voluntarily switched to a lower-yield brand that at the time of the

experiment was their usual brands The authors reported that "[t]he linear correlation

between blood cotinine and usual-brand nicotine yield is 0.542/-   Toe correlation was

statistically significant and the authors characterized it as "remarkably high" considering the

range of factors that might influence study results.^ Tney stated:

The regression line . . . indicates incomplete compensation on the order of 50%, that is, roughly midway between complete compensation (all smokers absorbing the same level of nicotine regardless of FTC yield) and smokers absorbing the exact FTC yield of nicotine for their particular brand. These _ daia indicate that on. average a smoker switching from a 1.0-mg product to a 0.5-mg product would, after several weeks of adjustment, achieve a 25% reduction in nicotine intake. This is not to say one could not find an individual 'permanent switcher1 who completely compensates (or find one who does not compensate at all). It is to say that, on average, lower nicotine-yield cigarettes are associated with a lower intake of nkotme.^

These reviews of the scientific literature on compensation strongly suggest that

       Studies suggest that compensation fa at most a phenomenon --"                   of limited duration.

Even those studies reporting that smokers compensate when switching from higher-yield to lower-yield cigarettes acknowledge that compensation is a phenomenon of limited duration. For example, in their review of brand-switching studies, Kozlowski and Pillitteri recognized that many of the existing brand-switching studies were conducted over a very short terra.35' Thus, although such studies may provide insight into changes in smoking behavior mat occur immediately after a person switches from a higher-yield to a lower-yield brand, they do not necessarily reflect changes that might occur after a person has grown accustomed to smoking & lower-yield brand. Surely h would not be a surprise to discover that some smokers take rime to become acclimated to a new cigarette with a different yield, and that this process of acclimation is reflected in their puffing behavior.

A 1992 study by Rosa and colleagues that examined compensatory behavior over, time found that those smokers who compensate do so for only limited periods.5*'   The

In a 1995 study. Reeves and Dixon switched smokers from one brand to another but kept each smoker within his or her accustomed yield category. In theory, this eliminated the time factor and allowed the authors to examine the effect of brand switching in isolation. Discussing the results of their study, they stated:

The data outlined in this paper clearly demonstrates [sic] that puff volumes, durations and pressures, both in terms of *per cigarette' and 'puff-by-puff,' were similar for the three products with machine derived tar yields of 14, 9 and 6 mg. These results appear to contradict the results of previous short-term switching studies which claim that low tar products are smoked more intensely than higher tar products.^

Commenting more generally on the issue of short-term studies mat detect evidence

of compensatory smoking behavior, Reeves and Dixon observed:

Short-term switching studies may indeed demonstrate that a smoker who is unfamiliar with a product of lower delivery may smoke in a more 'intense' manner. Smokers are driven by a number of sensory cues such as taste, irritation, impact, and mourn feel. The intensities of many of these sensory cues are related to the tar and nicotine deliveries of the product Thus a smoker accustomed to a specific set of sensory intensities from a fall flavour product may, when smoking a lower delivery product, alter his behaviour in an attempt to 'maximize' the sensory intensities from the lower delivery product26'

Benowitz and Henuingfield  perhaps the leading proponents of the "compensation"

theory today  stated in 1994 that compensation appears, to be temporary:

Overcompensation (i.e., inhaling mote smoke from low-nicotine cigarettes than from higher-yield brands) appears, however, to persist only for days or weeks. In long-torn studies of carbon monoxide exposure after subjects switched to lower-yield cigarettes, compensatory oversmoking appears not to persist.2'                                               ----:-     ~  * -- -     - -^ -  

b. Could compensatory smoking behavior be incorporated into the test by using different test parameters for different groups of cigarettes (I.e. higher test parameters for lower rated cigarettes and lowertest parameters for higher rated cigarettes)? If so, how many different groups of cigarettes should there be, and-whatparameters should be applied to each group? Where should the Une(s) separating the groups be drawn? Would using different sets of parameters overemphasize differences inyields between brands on either side of the dividing line(s) ? Would it cause cigarettes on either side of the dividing line(s) to "switch rankings " with respect to their upper tier ratings? If so, do these potential outcomes make the use of different parameters for different cigarettes undesirable?

1.      Different groups of cigarettes should not be tested under different testing parameters.

The fundamental flaw in implementing a protocol that smoked some cigarettes more

intensively than others is that such, a, protocol would conflict with one of the central tenets

of the Commission's testing - the; need for a uniform test method. The FTC stated in 1967

that "the uniform method determined by the Commission has as its purpose measurement

In 1978, die FTC explained the significance of a "uniform method":

[tp FTC's "tar" md nicotine values represented valid standards for making comparisons among different cigarettes. Thus, if the consumer smoked each different cigarette the same way, he would inhale "tar" and nicotine in amounts proportional to the relative value of the FTC Jigures.^

A testing method that smoked lower-yield cigarettes more intensely and higher-yield

cigarettes less intensively would sot provide a "valid standard^ ] for making comparisons."

That is because such a method would not allow the consumer to determine the relative

amounts of "tar" and nicotine that he or she would inhale if he or she smoked different

cigarettes in "the same way" (or even in a "similar way"), as the degree of difference

between the tests would itself be arbitrary.

In addition, a testing method mat smoked lower-yield cigarettes mote intensely than higher-yield cigarettes would not provide a "valid standard! ] for making comparisons" even to a smoker who actually did smoke different cigarettes in different ways. If a smoker changes puffing behavior in response to changes in cigarette yield, the smoker will do so in a unique way, not in a uniform and consistent way. The rootme analytical smoking machine, by contrast, can incorporate only a uniform and consistent change in puffing parameters that almost certainly would not reflect possible changes in the puffing behavior Of any smoker, let alone changes in the behavior of each individual smoker.

Since routine analytical smoking machines cannot replicate human smokmg behavior, a system that smokes lower-yield and higher-yield cigarettes differently could mislead   /    " consumers.    A test protocol under which, lower-yield cigarettes were smoked more   i   ^

As the FTC stated in 1967, sach a protocol would only "determine the amount of tar and nicotine generated when a cigarette is smoked by machine in accordance with the prescribed method."^

Thus, from a consumer information standpoint, it would be misleading to implement a test protocol under which lower-yield cigarettes were smoked more intensely than higher-yield cigarettes. Any line drawn between higher-yield and lower-yield cigarettes would be arbitrary and not based on objective, scientific considerations..

2. A protocol under which higher-yield tigarettes were smoked less Intensely than lower-yield cigarettes could lead to misleading shifts in the cigarette ratings*

The Commission stated that it declined to propose a protocol under which higher-yield cigarettes are smoked less intensively man lower-yield cigarettes because "using different puff parameters for different groups of cigarettes could artificially distort the rankings of brands near the dividing line between those groups."^ The manufacturers concur with the Commission's reasoning and oppose the implementation of such a protocol.

Regardless of where the line between higher-yield and lower-yield cigarettes was drawn, it is possible that subjecting higher-yield brands to a less intensive smoking regimen than lower-yield brands would result in misleading shifts in the ratings. If, for example, all brands with an FTC reported ntar* yield of 6 milligrams or less were classified as "lower-yield," then all such brands would be subjected to a more intensive smoking regimen

than brands with an FTC reported "tar" yield of seven or higher, Thus, for example, following die Commission's rules for rounding yield data, a brand with a "tar" yield of 6.4 milligrams (which rounds down to 6 milligrams) would be smoked more intensively than a brand with a yield of 6.6 milligrams (which rounds up to 7 milligrams). The effect could be to raise the rating of the lower-yield brand above the rating of the higher-yield brand. In me FTC's words, the brands would "switch rankings/

Such switches in the rankings would be misleading and a testing method that causes brands to "switch rankings" should be avoided. Those wbo support the application of more incense smoking parameters to lower-yield cigarettes do so because they apparently believe that scientific studies show that people smoke lower-yield brands more intensely ?*>?* higher-yield brands. As far as the manufacturers are aware, however, no one has claimed that scientific studies show mat people smoke a cigarette with an FTC reported "tar" yield of 6.4 milligrams more intensely man they smoke a cigarette with an FTC reported "tar" yield of 6.6 milligrams. Indeed, the scientific literature on "compensation" assumes that a person will smoke two brands with similar FTC reported yields in a similar manner.

Drawing a line between two brands with very similar FTC yields and subjecting mem to different smoking regimens could mislead consumers, potentially conveying an apparently erroneous message that two very sunilar brands ordmarily provide significantly different yields to the smoker.

c Could the effect of compensatory smoking behavior be incorporated into the test by blocking some or all of the aeration vents during testing? What does the available evidence demonstrate about the prevalence of vent blocking and about the percentage of vena that are blocked by those smokers who do engage in vent blocking? What effect, if any, does vent blocking have on smokers' pufffrequency, puff volume, and puff duration? if vent blocking were to be included in the upper tier of testing, how should that blocking be accomplished? If vent blocking were used to generate upper-tier tar and nicotine yields, would this lead cigarette companies to switch from fiber aeration to some other method of creating lower yield cigarettes? Jfso, what would be the effect on the relevance of the upper-tier yields?

1.      Fitter ventflfl&Hi is an important means of redudne "tar" and nicotine yields.                          _..   _    .          _    _   r

Filter (or "tip") ventilation is provided by rendering a portion of the filter wrap

(tipping and plugwrap) air-penneable.iS'   During puffing, some air enters the filter

directly, reducing the amount of air drawn past the cigarette coal, and thereby reducing the

effective puff volume. As a consequence, the overall reduction in smoke yield is roughly

proportional to the degree of ventilation.   Filler ventilation has been one of the most

effective cigarette design tools available to reduce FTC reported smoking yields, aa

evidenced by the trends in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields obtained over 30 years of testing.

82 Browne, C, The Design of Cigarettes 74 (1990); Klefer. J., "Ventilated Fitters and Their Effect on Smoke Composition/ Recent Adv. Tob. Sd., 4:69-83 (1978); Nomas, V., "The Effect of Perforated Tipping Paper on the Yield of Various Smoke Components/ Beitr. Tabdkforsh.t 7(5):2W-287 (1974).

Filter ventilation is achieved through me use of a perforated tipping paper (outer layer that is genenny cork oi white in color) and a porous ornonporous plugwrap,, which is the paper holding the niter fibers together in a rod-shaped configuration. Tipping papers may be perforated by mechanical, electrostatic, or laser methods prior to cigarette making, and these tippmgs are used with a porous plugwrap. Other tipping and plugwrap papers are nonporous, and the filter ventilation is achieved through laser perforation of the filter tip after cigarettes are made. The degree of ventilation widi both types of perforations is varied by mcmimber and size of the perforatiOK. Li cases of highly air-diluted cigarettes, multiple rows of perforations may be necessary to achieve the ventilation level desired. Regardless of the method used, a discrete region of air penncabilby is provided around the filter circumference between about 11 and 17 mm from the moumend of the filter.

2. Incorporating a Test blocking parameter into the puffing regimen presents a number of technical problems that may affect the renllcabilfty of results.

-   Dr. Borgerding has outlined some of the difficulties that are Kkery to arise if

ventilation hole blocking is performed in me laboratory as part of a testing method.

'__ The practical aspects of 50% vent blocking are prohibitive. No automated procedure cunently exists for blocking filter ventilation holes halfway with tape or glue. In experiments reported to date, filter ventilation has been partially occluded by manual application of tape or glue. It is likely mat such a process will increase smoke yield variability for a given cigarette population....^

According to Dr. Borgerding, effects mat may occur in the laboratory when technicians

attempt to block vent holes are deformation of the cigarette and loss of tobacco from the

cigarette rod. He stated: 'Both effects will increase variability." He concluded that "it is

best to avoid manual manipulation of cigarettes if consistent, reproducible analysis results

are desired. "^

Under regulations published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the

manufacturers recently reported nicotine yields obtained when cigarettes were tested on a

smoking machine using smoking parameters that incorporated a partial vent-blocking

condition. During the course^of that testing, researchers dixoverc^ a variety of practical

issues and problems.   Many of those practical issues and problems are discussed in

3.       Tb pixrtocol should not be nHMUfled to incorporate a Tcnt-bloddng condition.

A routine analytical smoking machine cannot reflect hypothesized human vent-blocking behavior because such a smoking machine cannot smoke tbe way a human being smokes.   Consequently, any effort to make mat smoking machine reflect vent-blocking behavior would geiierate new miinbers, b^ real relationship to actual individual smolring behavior.

As discussed in more detail below, the available literature appears to support the view that some smokers may block some ventilation holes during some puffs, but there is not support for me proposition mat a "significant" percentage of smokers engage in vent-blocking to a large degree. More important, to the extent mat vent4)lccldr^ inay occur, it clearly varies from smoker to smoker and, for a particular smoker, it may vary from one cigarette to the next. therefore, it is eirtirely unclear bow, if atan.iheTipr^-tiermethcd could be adjusted to reflect this behavior in a way that would be meamngral to a majority of smokers. Finally, the effects of any vent-blocking that does occur are at least partially "incorporated1' already in the proposed upper-tier lest method, which includes puffing conditions mat, according to the Commission, are "substantially more intensive than the 'average' smoking conditions identified by the Surgeon Getieral."

Such scattered evidence is not sufflcieot to Justify occluding ventilation holes as a test parameter.                                                                            i

Stain Pattern Studies. The evidence commonly cited in support of the view that a "significant" number of smokers block ventilation 2les ccotcs lhm five st^ the stain-pattern method developed by KozlowskL That method is based on the hypothesis that the stain patterns on the mouthend of a filter tip will differ depending upon the . percentage of ventilation holes that the smoker has blocked. To determine whether a particular filter shows evidence of hole blocking, a trained observer must look at the stain patterns on the mouthend and compare them with a purportedly "standard" set of patterns developed with the assistance of a smoking machine.

- The evidence from studies using the stain-pattern method is summarized in Table \J& Combining the data from the studies listed in Table 1 shows that overall approximately 4 percent trf examined fitters were judged b researchers tobe roratfy blocked while up to 29penent were judged to be partially blocked.

Some researchers have called into question the validity of the stain-pattern metiiod as a means of detecting ventilation hole blocking. In 1983 Lombardo reported the results af a study designed to evaluate the method. Lombard stated:

The mean accuracy of coniect labeling of the 10 imblccked cigarette butts .-" which subjects smoked without a cigarette bolter was only 37%, or little belter than chance. _ In contrast, 62% of unblocks* cia^ue^ smoked by subjects through holders were correctly labelled .... This finding underscores the need for rigid control in the preparation and standardization. of cigarette butts in evaluating ventilation hole blocking detection accuracy.*35'

Lombardo concluded: "It is possible that, even with .trained raters, the detection of

ventilation hole blocking in smokers may prove too unreliable to be useful. "*&

Kozlowsld himself recently expressed doubts about the usefulness of the method.

The results of this study indicate mat the stain pattern technique (Kozlowski et aL, 1988) is best suited to detect the presence versus absence of vent blocking rather than the extent of vent blocking, . . .

Infect, even this may be an overstatement of the method's value_becauseKo2lowski did not

attempt to evaluate the method's ability to discriminate between, for example, 5 percent

effective vent-blocking and 100 percent effective vent-blocking. la other words, given the

available evidence, the most that might be said for the stain-parteni method by its advocates

is that it can show that some people sometimes block some ventilation holes.

Studies of the stain patterns on unblocked filters have cast further doubt on the utility

of the stain pattern method,^ In & recent discussion of these studies. Baker and Lewis

wrote:

[EJven with completely unblocked ventilation zones and standard smoking machine test conditions, the filter stem pattern obtained depeoisraam of factors such as the degree of ventQadon, the number and size of the ventilation holes, the number of rows of boles, and the depth into which the holes perforate the fiber (as when holes are perforated by on-line laser). Depending on me contoatkm of these factor stam ventilated filters can range from a distinct "bull's eve" pattern to an almost -------uniform difinse pattern with staining across the eiith* titer end^

Baker and Lewis concluded that "the presence or absence of a distinctive "ball's eye*

staining patters, as used by Kozlowski and cn~wcikerj, is not necessarily related to the

incidence of vent blocking.mSSf

The difficulties with the studies in Table 1 arc not confined to problems with the

stain pattern method- A number of other problems must be addressed before attempting xo

draw any conclusions from the published data:

o       The total number of smokers whose behavior has been examined directly by -     researchers in published hole blocking studies is fewer than 100J& Kozlowski has attempted to downplay the relatively small number of people sampled by emphasizing me overlaps in the confidence intervals in me published literature.^

o The 1989 Kozlowski study involved people smoking in a laboratory and me 19S2 Kozlowski study involved interviews conducted at work. Subjects may smoke differently when smoking at home alone, at work, or in other more "natural" settings.                                                  .        ;     ^

o Some of the studies have been conducted using test cigarettes or brands other than those ordinarily smoked by the study subjects. People may smoke differently when smoking their own brands.

o Of me five studies listed in Table 1, only three report the number of smokers snidied and of those only one  Zacny (1988) - examined more man one filter per smoker. Thus, from the published Uterarure it is impossible to determine whether a smoker who reportedly blocks vent holes always blocks vent holes or always bloclo the same number of vent holes, whether smoking the same cigarene or from cigarette to cigarette.                                                                 ,.....,

Although much more research would need to be done before firm conclusions could be drawn, the implications of Table 3 nevertheless are quite imponam. Critics have focused attention on reported ventilation hole blocking in lower-yield products, suggesting that ventilation hole blocldng boosts yields to the point where the distinctions between full flavor, light and ultra* light cigarettes might become meaningless.

In fact, according to Table 3, assuming mat some ventilation hole blocking does occur among smokers of ultra-light products, between 79 and So" percent of such smokers would still obtain yields that were more than 50 percent less than the yield of the lowest-yield light products tested {i.e., 6.7 mg). Under these conditions, the research indicates no smoker of ultra-light cigarettes obtained a yield mat would equal the FTC reported yield of a light cigarette and, a fortiori* no smoker of ultra-light cigarettes would obtain a yield that approached that of a full flavor cigarette.

ultra-light cigaiettes would ordinarily obtain an ultra-light yield, although sometimes the

yield may be higher than the yield mw^ by tte FTC method^

It is therefore possible that even if some smokers do Mock some ventilation holes

some of the time, the actual effect on the yields that they obtain may be relatively small.

Moreover, if there is any effect on yields, it is not sufficient to imdegnmo the basic

distinction between mil flavor, light and ultra-light cigaiettes. Thus, when smokers smoke

cigarettes with lower FTC reported yields, the yield that they receive in their mouths will

be lower. They also wQl inhale lower quantities of "tar" and nicotine.

5.      Evidence concerning the effect of vent blocking on puff volume, frequency and duration is Boated and inconclusive.

':     Studies that measure changes in puff votoe, frequency and duradon are condticte^

in laboratory settings under unnatural conditions.   Sometimes flow-measuring devices

actually are attached to die cigarette while tte smoker smokes. Typically, such studies are

limited to a small number of subjects.

In a 1986 study, Zacny and colleagues studied people smoking cigarettes with the

vent holes unblocked, 50-percent blocked, or 100-percent blocked.^ In one phase of

the study, researcher* allowed the OTLOto

topography. They reported that subjects took significantly more puffs at shorter mtcrpuff

intervals and larger puff volumes with vent hobs unblocked than with 50 or 100 percent of

the holes blocked.^                          ji                                              . "~        r                         ,

Researchers from Brown & Williamson Tobacco and British American Tobacco recently reported results from a study showing that, for cigarettes with PTC "tar" yields of from one to three milligrams, the mean puff number showed a statistically significant drop from more man nine with ventilation holes unblocked to approximately seven with ventilation holes 100 percent Mocked.^ The change in puff number for cigarettes with higher yields was not statistically significant The researchers also reported that, for cigarettes with "tar" yields of one to three milligrams and cigarettes with "tar" yields of four to six milligrams, there was a statistically significant drop in mean puff volume and total puff volume when 50 percent or 100 percent of ventilation holes were covered. They concluded mat vent-blocking does alter smokers* puffing behavior.

Clearly, a great deal more research would have to be conducted before the FTC

could draw any conclusions about the relationship between ventilation hole blocking, puff

volume, puff frequency and puff duration.

1. A multiplier Is not appropriate to reflect compensation because compensation, to the extent It actually occurs, is a behavior that fades among smokers and cigarettes smoked.    ,      -__

Tbt FTC test met&od was not designed to reflect - and cannot be made to reflect - human smoking behavior. Moreover, existing studies concerning compensation and vent Mocking are insufficient to jtutify making changes in the FTC smoking method or in the proposed upper-tier testing method. Consequently, such studies do not "provide a sufficient basis" for developing an equation to "adjust" the current FTC ratings to take account of purported compensatory behavior and vent-hole blocking.

The Commission asks how closely equations could "approximate the compensation effect." For rhe reasons discussed above, any notion of "die compensation effect" is questionable. Assuming that compensation and vent-hole blocking do occur, these behaviors will vary from smoker to smoker and, for a particular smoker, from one cigarette to the next. Thus, an equation or set of multipliers could not approximate a single "compensation effect* because "the" compensation effect does not exist. There is no equation to simulate human behavior or compensation. Such a multiplier would therefore, of necessity, be arbitrary.

While theoretically an equation might attempt to approximate the "average" effects of compensation or venMrioclting as reported in scientific studies, as the Commission stated in 1967, "Where am too many variables as to botosm average to be meamngful."***'  As discussed above, Kozlowski and Pfllitteri cited six

On purely mathematical grounds, of course, it always is possible to devise an

equation that will relate two sets of numbers. Thus, one could define a particular set of

numbers as "ratings diet take into accoimt compensation and ventilation hole blocking," and

develop an equation mat would relate those "ratings' to the current FTC ratings.   The

equation would do no more, however, than state a mathematical relationship between two

arbitrarily defined sets of numbers.-^                                .    -'

depends on how intensely you smote it*) conveys in a simple and straightforward fashion

^ As noted above, me Massachusetts Department of Public Health has mandated that the manufacturers report nicotine yield data obtained from a testing method that incorporates a ventilation hole blocking parameter. See 105 CMR 660.102(B)(3) and Appendix 2C.

The legend of Attachment A also conveys two messages.   But the first message ("There's no such thing as a sate smoke") is a message about smoking and health  not a . message about the relationship between smoking behavior and "tar" and nicotine intake.   -Because it is a message about smoking and health, it would r^t be withm the Commission's power to require.1*2' The second message ("Even cigarettes with low ratings can give you   . high amounts of tar and nicotine. It depends on how you smoke/) is ambiguous because it uses tirrms of comparison that aict^

and nicotine? What is a "high amount" of "tar" and nicotine?)- the manufacturers believe that the second message is also incomplete, because it does not mention, conversely, the possibility that smokers may be able to get as little "tar" and nicotine from a higher-yield cigarette as from a lower-yield cigarette, depending on how they smoke.

d. The proposed disclosures do hot contain information regarding carbon monoxide ratings. Should information regarding carbon monoxide ratings be included in any disclosure format that is adopted? Why or why not? If such information is provided, haw should it be done? How closely do carbon monoxide ratings obtained in smoking machine tests correlate with tar and nicotine ratings?

Cigarette advertisements currently cany, as one of the four rotating Surgeon

General's health, warnings, the message that "Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide."

Without research, it cannot be known whether including tbe CO ratings for a particular

brand style with the "tar" and nicotine ratings that are currently dispkyed for the brand style

would influence a smoker's choice of cigarette or the smoker's basic decision to smoke.

between cigarette yields using an alternative puffing regimen and the standard FTC piff^g regiment provide insight into the correlation between CO yields with either "tar" or nicotine ratings obtained in machine tests. From the study, it is clear mat CO ratings increase as either "tar" or nicotine ratings increase when cigarettes are tested with the standard PTC puffing regimen. For filtered cigarettes, a strong linear relationship is observed between CO yields and either "tar" or nicotine yields.^' Non-filtered cigarettes yield less CO than would be expected from a filtered cigarette with equivalent "tar* or nicotine yields. Similar relationships between CO yields and either "tar* or nicotine yields

t. Should the disclosures include information concerning the ratio of the cigarette's tar and nicotine ratings? Would these ratios provide useful information to smokers?

The disclosure should sot include information on ratios.  The inclusion of such

information would former complicate a proposed rating system that is already too

complicated and would appear to serve no meaningful purpose.  In addition, interested

consumers could calculate such a ratio for themselves. Research should be undertaken to

determine consumer talce-away and the likclih^

tawleaicntatiott of educational efforts.

/. Would it be necessary to require that the disclosures be printed in black text on a white background* or would it be sufficient to retain the standard embodied in the cigarette manufacturers' 1970 agreement - then is, that the disclosure be clear and prominent?

The terms of the 1970 agreement That the disclosures he made "clearly and

prominently" and "in a color (including black or white) clearly contrasting with the color

of the background should be continued. Requiring that the disclosures be printed in black

text on a white background would place die disclosures on a par with the Surgeon General's

warnings.

a. RatUr than move to a two^er test method, \^uld it be preftn^ to test cigarettes under a stogie protocol and use consumer education and an advertising disclosure to inform consumers what the ratings do and do not represent, and thai What smokers get firm any particular cigarette depends in large part on how they smoke it? If so, should cigarettes continue to he tested under a protocol that uses a 2 second, 3$ milliliter puff every minute, or should deferent smoking parameters be used? What form should such consumer education take (e.g., informational materials at the point of purchase) and what should it say?

M discussed above, the manufacturers are not convinced thai a two-tier test method

is necessary to communicate the message that how much "tar" and nicotine a smoker gets

from a cigarette depends on how the cigucttc is smoked, ai^ indeed such a mctnod lias the

downside potential of misleading smokers into beUevipgdsat the new test results bracket the

range of actual human intake.  For that reason, the manufacturers believe that a rating

system with a single "tar" and nicotine number per brand style should be continued. For

purposes of historical continuity, and to avoid the potential for confusing smokers, wo

believe that the current smokmg-machine test parameters should continue to be used. A

new arbitrary set of parameters would be no better man die current arbitrary set of

parameters.    Despite our belief that adequate information is currently available to

consumers, supplementing the rating with the legend set fiirmmAmichmemB to reinforce

the message mat how much "tax" and nicotine a smoker gets from a cigarette depends on

how intensely me cigarette is smoked would appear to be an appropriate means of

b. Rather than move to a two-tier testmethod, would it be preferable to drop all FTC approval of the tar and nicotine testing system? Are all potential ratings so Inherently flawed and misleading, and tkepossMidafbrin^ro^gthe^stemsounWcetytosucc^d, that use of any numerical tar and nicotine ratings should be ended? Would such a change affect smoking intensity, brand choice, andfor the decision whether to quit smoking, and if lo, how?                                             ':..'.'"'"'-                           :

"Tar" and nicotine ratings have been an established feature of cigarette advertising

for over 25 yean, and the manufacturers believe that some smokers use those ratings in

making brand style choices. Such ratings are not "flawed": they axe produced by operating

the smoking machines according to the prescribed test method.  Neither an such ratings

misleading: the real issue is whether mey are properly understood by smokers. The FTC

reported ratings certainly are misanderstood if mey are thought to represent actual human

hitake (a misund^rstaiadlng that a do^

thought to signify that a smoker receives the same amount of "tar" and nicotine indicated

from a cigarette regardless of how the cigarette is smoked.  What is important is that

smokers understand what the ratings do and do not represent- Such an understanding can

be fostered through public education efforts by the Commission as well as by a legend in

cigarette advertising making clear that how much 'tar" and nicotine a smoker gets from a

cigarette depends on how intensely the cigarette is smoked.      .

c. Should the cigarette test method attempt to measure or otherwise account for the bioavailability of the nicotine in different cigarettes? If so, how should It do so? Is the a&aUnity of the nicotine a surrogate for bioavailability? It there a mathematical model by which bioavailability can be computed from nicotineyield, alkalinity, and other information?

As iwted above, the manLfacturersbelkw

attempt to measure or otherwise account for me "bioavailability" of the nicotine delivered

to smokers.   This means, therefore, mat the manufacturers do not believe mat using a

"surrogate" for bioavailability would be appropriate. To the extent that others seek to have

such a surrogate, the use of the "alkalinity of nicotine" as such a surrogate would be

inappropriate. As the Surgeon General noted in 1988:

When tobacco smoke reaches Die small airways and alveoli of the hmg. the nicotine is rapidly absorbed. The rapid absorption of iiicotine fiom cigarette smoke through the hmg occurs because oftbehiMjesurfi^ area cif me alveoli and small airways and because of dissolution of nicotine atphysiological pH (approximately 7.4), which facilitates transfer across cell membranes^

Similarly, in 1978, Russell stated:

Although the pH of the smoke of many cigarettes is acidic ..., absorption of nicotine via the fangs is nevertheless extremely rapid. This is probably partly due to the vast surface area for absorption and partly that the pH of

A number of researcher! have acknowledged that me "pH of cigarette smoke" has

little effect oa the ability of a smoker to absorb" nicotine following inhalation.   For

example. Slale stated that:                                                   r

[t]he tongs present an enormous surface area for inhaled smoke, and even ionized nicotine, is readily absorbed across the respiratory epithelium ytfth an efficiency of over 90% J

Similarly, Benowitz acknowledged mat the "pH of tobacco smote" has little effect

on the absorption of nicotine: "When tobacco smote reaches the small'airways and alveoli

of me long, the mcotme is absorbed rapidly, regardless of ihe pH of the smoke/^Sf

Other researchers similarly have stated that "the absorption of nicotine through me alveoli

of [the] lung seems to be related simply to the concentration of the alkaloid in me smote,

and that Vie influence of the pH of the aqueous phase of the smoke is negligible.**3

Accordingly, the creation of a mathematical model by which to measure bioavailability is

unnecessary.

d. Jfthe effect of compensatory smoking behavior Li not incorporated in the tar and nicotine ratings, should a disclosure warning smokers about compensatory smoking behavior be required in all ads? Would such a disclosure likely be effective in reinforcing the consumer education efforts?                                       =-     -

the manufacturers are not convinced tilt compensatory smoking behavior is a sufficiently common or documented phenomenon that consumers should be alerted to its existence, and mey believe that consumer research wodd need to be coiiductcd to dctennine the pervasiveness of the behavior as weU as c^^

and its effect, if any, on consumer behavior. However, should the Commission determine that a disclosure is warranted, the manofacturers believe the legend set form in Attachment B is sufficient to convey the message mat a smoker can receive varying amounts of "tar" and nicotine from a cigarette depending on how the cigarette is smoked, with more intense smoking producing higher yields and less intense smoking producing lower yields.

5.        Other Issues

a.       What available evidence exists concerning new relatively low tar and nicotine ratings and their perception of the relative risks of srnoktng such cigarettes rather than jm flavor cigarettes?

The ideal quantitative biomarisr of "tar" intake should be: (1) specific to cigarette smoke; (2) highly mandated with "tar* yield across diverse cigarette constructions and across individual and situational differences in smoking style; and (3) detectable by well-validated and sensitive analytical methods. There ate no MomarJcers that satisfy all of these criteria fuUy.

Nicotine is not a good biomarker tor "tar" for many reasons, mongh ft may well be the best candidate currently available, given that all other possibilities have many experimental and conceptual problems vim their use as bkaaarkers for "tar/

First, nicotine and "tar" axe very different is terms of their chemical and physical properties. "Tar" is a mixture of thousands ofcomryounds; thereisnoone "tar/as "tar" can vary from cigarette to cigarette, from brand to brand, and from day to day. Indeed, the chemical composition of "tar" can change during storage. Nkotine is a ^ccific, unique and well-documented single substance of defined chemical and physical properties. It is perhaps naive to consider mat any one substance can serve as a surrogate or biomaiker fox "tar."

-91-Nteotine, and all metabolites of nicotine, nave a specific problem in their potential use as a biomarker for "tar/ The nicotme-to-"Qr" ratio (by the FTC method, by the ISO method, and by the various other-methods which attempt to determine possible compensation and vent blocking by smokers) varies with the "tar" yield. It is well-known mat products with higher filtration and dilution have a lower nkotme-to~*tar" ratio man full-flavored products. The existence of difterentnicotme-to-*ta" ratios mcoinm^ nicotine an inaccurate biomarker for "tar." Consider, for example, a smoker who smokes one lull-flavor cigarette with 16* mg "tar" and 1.1 rag. nicotine, and a smoker who smokes eleven low delivery cigarettes with a delivery of 1 mg *tar" and 0.1 mg of nicotine in the same fashion,   The research conducted to date would suggest that bom smokers would absorb the same amount of nicotine (1.1 mg); however, mere would be a vast difference in their absorption of "tar" tone smoker gets 16 mg, and the other gets 11 mg. The difference between these two "tar" munbcrs approaches 50%. Therefore, at any given nicotine level, a smoker could absorb a vast range of "tar" y>'& - which could vary as much as 50% -depending on the number and type of cigarettes smoked. As a result, from the perspective of the products themselves, nicotine is not an accurate biomarker for "tat."

In addition, from me perspective of the mdividtial smoker, ihe gjg^ifif-anfly different ways consumers smoke and the consequent unpredictable relationship between nicotine yield and "tar* yield can also render the use of nicc^ine as a birjmarker ineffective fw          This

Some have cited variations in the "tar'/nicotinc ratio as a ground for criticizing the

uof nicotine as a btomirioor for'tar.1 In his presentation to the NCI Ad Hoc Committee

<m the PTC test method, Benowitz stated that

when cigarette* are smoked more intensely, the tax-to-nicotme ratio of low-yidd dgarettw faweases substantially. Thus, when smokers compensate for low-yield cigarettes by smoking mem more intensely, the tar-to-nicoticc ratio increases.

1.         Should be unique or nearly unique for ETS so mat other sources are minor in comparison;

2.         should be easily detectable;

4.         should have a fairiy constant ratio to other El^cornriooents of interest under a range of environmental conditions encountered.

It is reasonable mat a similar set of guidelines should apply to mainstream smoke. In fhb

generated from gas phase components may be ruled out because of criteria 1, 3 and 4.

When observations from the more contemporary studies are compered vrtth those from the 1950% one important but disturbing conclusion is apparent - mortality risks among continuing smokers, both mates and females, have increased.

What effect, if any, do the findings reported in this Monograph have on the Ad Hoc Committee's conclusion that die smoking of 'cigarettes with lower machine-measured yields has a small effect in reducing the risk of cancer caused by smoking* ?

Tie manufacturers take no position with respect to me effort of these findings on the

Ad Hoc Committee's conclusion.   The manufacturers do not claim that lower-yield

cigarettes are "safe" or are "safer* than higher-yield cigarettes, and every cigarette

advertisement and every cigarette package jnrhidrs one of four rederaUy-mandated health

warnings thai are incompatible with the belief that any cigarette is "safe' or is "safer" than

Tl.       Cigarette Descriptors

1. Is there a need for official guidance wim respect to the terms used in marketing lower rated cigarettes? If yes, why? If no. why not?

The manufacturers are not convinced that there is a need for official guidance with

respect to the terms used in marketing lower rated cigarettes. The terms "light" or "low

tar" generally are used to describe cigarette* whh iar" Tating* nf 7 m 15 iqffljgww^ rfr>

"ultra light" or ultra low tar" describes cigarettes with, ratings of 6 mfl%Tiye or less.

These terms are usually used as a point of con^>ariscti for an established brand in order to

distmguisharnOTig retard brand styles. The marmractmers believe smokers understand mat

these descriptors are term* of comparison rather than signifies of absolute value.  Tber

providcd by title descriptors. Changes in the established use of those terms coald lead to

substantial   confusion   and  brand-switching   among   consumers,   farther  muddying

communication of relative rankings-

Z What data, evidence or other relevant information on consumer interpretation and understanding of terms such as "ultra low tar," "ultra tight, * "tow tar, * "light," 'medium, * "extra tight* and 'ultima," as used in the context of cigarettes exists? Do consumers believe they will get significantly less tar pom cigarettes described as 'light* or "law tar' than from regular or full flavor cigarettes, and do they believe they will get Significantly less tar from cigarettes described as "ultra low tar' or "ultra light" than from 'light' or "law.tar" cigarettes? Do the descriptors convey implied health claims?

The manufacturers believe that consumers choose "light" or "ultra" products for a

variety of reasons, Including lighter flavor, lighter taste, less menthol (or other flavor) taste,

aid smoother smoldng characteristics. Some consumers may choose such products for other

reasons. The mamifacturers do not intend die descriptors to convey any level of "safety"

with regard to their products.   In feet, the health warnings required on every cigarette

package and in every cigarette advertisement are incompaJdWewtth the swggesticii that airy

cigarette is "safe" or is "safer* than any other cigarette.

3. Do consumers use descriptors, rather than the FTC tar and nicotine ratings, as their primary source of information about the tar and nicotine yields of different cigarette brands? What data or evidence examines this question? ff consumers use descriptors as their primary source of Information about tar and nicotmeyields, what implications does this have for the proposed revisions to the test method and the advertlsmg disclosure?

As noted in response to the last question, the reasons consumers choose lower-yield

products ere varied and complex.   The rcannfacturers are not aware of evidence that     ;__

INTRODUCTION                                                            "

On December 15,1997t the nation's cigarette manufacturers provided the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with the first test results required under the Commonwealth's new cigarette testing taw.1 The data included information on cigarette brand families sold in the United States that had more than a 5% national market share during the previous year. Testing conducted to comply with the Massachusetts regulations included evaluations of smoke nicotine, tobacco nicotine, "smoke pH'and filter ventilation.

This Appendix reviews the results of the testing conducted pursuant to the Massachusetts requirements. Those results, and any conclusions drawn from those results, may or may not be reliable since the testing requirements do not represent scientifically validated methods. Because the data were obtained without the benefit of methods validation or fnterlaboratory comparison of common cigarette brand styles (I.e., each manufacturer was required to test only .Its own brand styles), the data summarized in this Appendix are necessarily crude and imprecise,                                                         -

PRACTICAL ISSUES

The prescribed testing requirements were marked by certain ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors that could be eliminated or resolved by a method validation process and interlaboratory testing. For example:

    The regulations specify the puff volume for determining smoke nicotine both as a 43 cc puff volume and a 45 cc puff volume. The manufacturers chose to use a 45 cc puff volume.

_    Conditioning of cigarettes prior to ventilation testing and testing of tobacco nicotine content required by the regulations, is inconsistent with common practice in the United States.

    The method prescribed for determining tobacco nicotine content uses a poor choice of solvent (methyl t-butyl ether is extremely volatile and sample is lost during the GC injection process).

    The requirements also inaccurately specify both tobacco, nicotine-standard preparation procedures (generally with an error of about

10%) and nicotine recovery estimates (generally with an error of about 50%).

    The standard Cambridge filter pad used in the FTC method has a limited collection capacity that is often exceeded under the conditions specified in the Massachusetts requirements. Consequently some of

- the nicotine produced by the cigarettes under the conditions specified by Massachusetts DPH may not be collected by the pad.

    The "smoke pH" trap specified by the requirements is not commercially available.

    The Scotch-brand tape specified to partially block filter ventilation holes cannot be easily used to block holes on cigarettes that have circumferences greater than or less than 25 millimeters. This creates a great potential for inconsistency and imprecision in vent-hole   , blocking.

As required by the Massachusetts regulation, the FTC nicotine yields reported to the Commonwealth in 1997 were those values found in the most recent FTC report which represented values for cigarettes purchased in 1994. Also as required by the Massachusetts regulation, these FTC values were submitted along with values generated from tests of cigarettes purchased in Massachusetts in 1997. Comparing these two sets of numbers may be problematic because, in some cases, design parameters of particular brand-styles may have changed between 1994 and 1997.                                           f

In contrast to scientifically validated method, the requirements provided by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not represent a set of definitive directions because they were subject to differences in interpretation and implementation. Consequently it was possible for different laboratories to follow the same requirements and obtain different results - even when testing the same cigarette brand-styles. For example:

1.   The variation In the "smoke pH* values achieved by the four cigarette manufacturers is apparently the direct result of the fact that no standardized "smoke pH" method exists.                                        -

2.   The wide discrepancy in Massachusetts nicotine yields at any given standard FTC nicotine yield is apparently the result of differences in the application of the requirements between laboratories (see, especially, FTC nicotine yields of 1.2 mg/cig and greater in Figure 1).     ____       ......       - - - -

Also, as RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. noted in its December 12.1997, cover letter to Dr. Gregory N. Connolly, director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health:

"To better understand the serious limitations posed by a lack of methods validation, consider that even a very cursory comparison of the two dote sets provided by RJR reveals significant differences (generally on the order of -10% - 20% tor the measurement of nicotine in tobacco and tobacco smoke) for the same products, despite the fact that RJR and Labstat [the contract laboratory used by RJR] each attempted to follow to trie letter the instructions contained within the regulations. 8ecause many of those instructions m subject to multiple interpretations and implementations, the results obtained by our two laboratories are not directly comparable even for the same brand-styles of cigarettes. The values obtained from the tests in RJ. Reynolds laboratories are generally greater than those obtained by Labstat We do not, however, know which (if either) of the two data sets is "accurate", so we have provided both for your review. We are currently performing a comparative analysis of these two data sets. This points out an even larger problem, rf we cannot obtain consistent interiaboraf ory results for the same cigarette brand styles, how can meaningful comparisons be made among different brand styles from different manufacturers tested in different laboratories?"

\\                           Despite the problems presented by the fact that the Massachusetts testing

I                           requirements have not been scientifically validated, several observations about

l|:;                     -the results can be made:

i\                                   --          -                    --          -     -..   -

'ft;

Smoke Nicotine - The smoke nicotine values obtained using the Massachusetts testing requirements were roughly twice the values obtained under standard FTC smoking conditions for the brands tested. At the same time, the relative ranking of cigarette brand styles produced under standard FTC machine smoking conditions was maintained by the Massachusetts tests for the tested brands.2                      ......              .   Z                         -

Filter Ventilation - Cigarettes with the highest degrees of filter ventilation yielded smaller amounts of nicotine than cigarettes with lesser degrees of

i.                              filter ventilation both (1} when cigarettes were smoked as manufactured with

the standard FTC smoking conditions (i.e., the filter vents open) and (2) when cigarettes were smoked with the filter vents half-blocked, as specified .-   by the Massachusetts testing requirements.

*    Tobacco Nicotine - The amount of nicotine in the cigarette itself provided no consistent indication of how much smoke nicotine the cigarette would yield when cigarettes were tested with either the standard FTC smoking condition or the smoking conditions specified in the Massachusetts requirements. This result is consistent with the view that mainstream cigarette smoke contains only a small and variable portion of the nicotine contained in the cigarette

"   itself.

?    "Smoke pH" - Substantial differences were not observed in "smoke pH levels among the cigarette brand styles that were tested by eny single method bv any one company. As such, no correlation between "smoke pH* and smoke nicotine yields was observed for the brand styles tested.

- Differences in "smoke pH* levels were observed from laboratory to laboratory (company to company). This result was not surprising since no standard method for "smoke pH" exists and each laboratory employed a different test (or tests) to comply with the Massachusetts reporting deadline.

2 Some small differences are to be expected because of the considerations noted in the Practice! Issues section above. Specifically, problems arising from (1) the fact that cigarettes purchased In 1994 (and reported in the most recent FTC report) may not be directly comparable to cigarettes purchased in 1997 (and                  Jj

tested according to Massachusetts requirements) and (2) the fact that the                ;    S If

specified testing requirements did not undergo a method validation process (i.e.,           a [

there were a number of interlaboratory testing differences based on different                 S '

interpretations of the specified requirements).                                                                   *

TESTING RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Data submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Health on December 15, 1997, along with a brief discussion of some of the problems encountered by the companies in generating those data, follows. ... _    _     __.,_..

~ SMOKE NICOTINE RESULTS

1) The relative ranking of cigarette brand styles produced under standard FTC machine smoking conditions was generally maintained by the Massachusetts tests for the brands tested.

Figure 1 compares smoke nicotine yields generated under the Massachusetts -requirements with those generated under standard FTC conditions.3 The chart > includes data for five different brand families. Each manufacturer generated data for its own brand styles. In addition, one manufacturer contracted with an outside laboratory to independently assess its brand styles. All data are reported in the chart Because the requirements specified by the Massachusetts regulations do not yet represent validated scientific methods, the results from the five laboratories that generated data may or may not be directly comparable.

The cigarettes tested represent FTC nicotine yields ranging from approximately 0.4 mg/cig to 1.4 mg/cig. The Massachusetts yields were higher than the value of the FTC yields for any particular brand-style tested. The Massachusetts yields were, in fact, approximately twice as high as the FTC yields for the tested . cigarettes. Because this relationship was consistent from brand stylo to brand style, the relative rantdng of the brands was maintained (see Footnote 2), regardless of which testing condition was used,

It should be noted that the discrepancy in the results at standard FTC nicotine yields of 1.2 mg/cig and above (see Figure 1} may be the result of differences in the application of the requirements between laboratories. This highlights the - need for a validated, standardized method.

3 A3 noted, comparing these two seta of numbers may be problematic because, in some cases, design parameters of particular brand-styles may have changed between 1994 and 1997. It should also be noted that Figure 1 is based on rounded FTC nicotine values, as specified by FTC protocol. This rounding reduces natural variation along the x axis and tends to exaggerate the apparent "scatter" along the y axis.

2) Massachusetts smoke nicotine yields fell within the range of yields produced by the proposed FTC two-tier system.

-The nicotine yield numbers generated for the brand styles tested under the Massachusetts conditions fell within the range of numbers produced by the proposed FTC two-tier system.

Figure 2 compares the test results recently submitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Hearth with results from an experiment reported to the FTC staff June 23,1997/ As Figure 2 shows, the Massachusetts yields were less than or similar to the FTC upper-tier yields, ft should be noted that the 1997 Massachusetts testing results only included cigarettes with FTC nicotine yields ranging from approxfmately 0.4 mg/dg to 1.4 mo/cig. Yields for other cigarettes when tested under the Massachusetts requirements may, or may not fan within the range of the proposed FTC two-tier testing system.

FILTER VENTILATION

Even wfth partial vent-blocking, nicotine yields of cigarettes generally decreased as flKer ventilation Increased.

Figure 3 describes the relationship between standard FTC nicotine yields and - the percentage of filter ventilation In unblocked cigarettes. The figure clearly ' shows that nicotine yields tended to decrease as filter ventilation increased for the cigarette brand-styles tested.

The amount of nicotine found In the tested cigarettes did not provide a consistent Indication of how much nicotine would appear in the smoke from those cigarettes.

Figure 5 compares smoke nicotine yields generated under standard FTC conditions to the total amount of nicotine found in the cigarette itself. Figure 6 similarly compares smoke nicotine yields generated under the Massachusetts requirements with the total amount of nicotine found in the cigarette Itself for the tested brands. It is clear from both figures that the amount of nicotine per cigarette did not predict machine-generated smoke nicotine yields for the cigarettes tested. These figures also show that in : general, mainstream cigarette smoke contained only a small and variable portion of the nicotine contained In the cigarette,

The amount of nicotine In the cigarettes tested was one - but by no means the only - factor in determining the smoke nicotine yields observed.. Such design variables as filter ventilation and the use of expanded tobacco, among others, also played a role. It was the combined effects of these design factors in each of the cigarettes tested that ultimately determined how much nicotine was transferred to the smoke under machine smoking conditions.

"SMOKE pH"

The results of tests mandated by the Massachusetts regulations Indicate   ' that there fs very little variation In "smoke pH" among the products tested.

Figure 7 compares Massachusetts "smoke pH" values with standard FTC smoke nicotine yields, using a pH scale that includes the entire range of possible pH values. Figure 8 shows the same data compared on a pH scale that includes only pH values actually measured. A number of important points are clear

:: from both charts:

1) There do not appear to be any substantial differences in "smoke pH" levels among the cigarette brand styles that were tested by any single method by any one company (despite the broad range of standard FTC nicotine yields for the brand styles tested).

2) The larger differences that were observed comparing the brand families from different companies were likely due to differences in testing methodology, rather than to actual "smoke pHB differences between those brand families. This is most evident in the data from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., which tested its brand styles with two different methods and generated quite different results (Or the same cigarette brand-styles ('smoke pH" values using one method - "whole smoke" -* ranged from 4.63 to 4.96, while the values for the same cigarette brand-styles ranged from 5.69 to 5,89 for the other method - "Mass-TPM').

These differences are the direct result of the fact that "smoke pH" is a theoretical concept concerning smoke (rather than an actual property of smoke) and no standardized "smoke pH" method exists. As a result, in the tests conducted to comply with the December 15,1997 deadline, methodological differences included:

-     a number of dlfferentsmoking machines were used;

*    the number of cigarettes smoked per determination varied widely;

-    the smoke fraction(s) that were collected were inconsistent (one

company collected smoke particles only, one collected smoke particles and smoke vapors separately, and two companies collected whole smoke);

*    the water volume used to collect smoke varied; and

*    the total number of cigarettes tested varied substantially.

The importance of these methodological differences is demonstrated by "smoke pH* values derived by the four companies for the Kentucky reference . cigarette 1R4F. Testing of this standard reference cigarette indifferent laboratories yielded values ranging from approximately 4.5 to 6.0 - roughly the same range observed for the brand families tested by the various

^   companies. Because these differences can be attributed to methodological inconsistencies, it is likely that there would be minimal differences, .if any, in 'smoke pH* levels among all of the cigarettes brand-styles tested by the four manufacturers if they were all tested using a single, standard, validated method.

FTC Consumer Alert!

Up In Smoke: The Truth About Tar and Nicotine Ratings

May 2000

Why do some smokers choose "low tar" and "light" cigarettes? Because they think these cigarettes may be less harmful to their health than regular cigarettes.

The Federal Trade Commission wants you to know that cigarette tar and nicotine ratings cant predict the amount of tar and nicotine you get from any particular cigarette. That's because how you smoke a cigarette can significantly affect the amount of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide you get from your cigarette. Research indicates that many smokers of "low tar" or "light" cigarettes compensate by taking deeper, longer, or more frequent puffs from their cigarettes The amount of tar and nicotine a smoker actually gets also can increase if the smoker unintentionally blocks tiny ventilation holes in cigarette filters that are designed to dilute smoke with air.

When it comes to "low tar" and 'light" cigarettes, the FTC wants you to know:

   The tar and nicotine numbers used in advertising and on packaging are determined using a smoking machine - a smoking "robot" so to speak - that smokes every brand of cigarette exactly the same way.

   The numbers do not represent the amount of tar and nicotine a particular smoker may get: First, people don't smoke cigarettes the same way the machine does; second, no two people smoke the same way.

  Many lower tar cigarettes have filters with veiy small vent holes in the sides that allow air to dilute the smoke in each puff It's easy for smokers to cover the holes unknowingly; that results in them getting more tar and nicotine.

  It's impossible to tell from the ratings the amount of tar and nicotine a smoker will get from any cigarette. Smokers of lower nicotine cigarettes tend to compensate for the lower nicotine by taking deeper and more frequent puffs than they would from a regular cigarette.

   The amount of tar and nicotine smokers actually get depends on how deep and how often they puff on the cigarette and whether they block the vent holes.

   Smoking "low tar" or "light" cigarettes does not eliminate the health risks of smoking. Tf you're concerned about the health risks of smoking, stop smoking.

The amount of tar and nicotine you get from your cigarette depends on how you smoke your cigarette. Don't count on the numbers. There's no such thing as a safe smoke For more information, call the FTC toll-free, I-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357) or visit wwwftc.gov for the Commission's 1997 Annual Report on Cigarelle Advertising.

% SUBJECT:    PM USA Advertisins/ "Tar" & Nicotine Disclosure                             ^

PM USA has decided to begin including information in its advertising regarding the effect of smoking practices on the amount of "tar" and nicotine delivered by a cigarette.

Accordingly, all Philip Morris U.S.A. brand advertising that contains a "tar" and nicotine disclosure should include the following legend:

"The amount of "tar" and nicotine you inhale will vary depending on how you smoke the cigarette."

The legend will always accompany the "tar" and nicotine disclosure. This copy should be placed directly below, and in the same type size, font and contrasting typography as the "tar" and nicotine disclosure. Enough space should be left between the two so that the "tar" and nicotine disclosure remains clear and conspicuous. In the case of multiple disclosures on pieces such as direct mail communications, there should be multiple legends. This will also necessitate a change to the placement of the web site information as outlined in my memo of January 5, 2000. The format should now be: i) "tar" and nicotine numbers disclosure; ii). additional "tar" and nicotine smoking disclosure; and, iii) web site information.

This new copy should be implemented immediately, provided that the copy should be added as materials are prepared without interrupting production of materials already underway. In addition, care should be taken that all pieces produced for a promotion carry the same copy.

We are advising the legal departments at Leo Burnett and Young & Rubicam of these changes by copy of this memo. Please share this information with your organizations and with any other agency for which it is applicable.

Mr. MeCormick:

As requested, Jim Alexander, the technical consultant who handles searches of the Adult Tobacco Consumer Database (the "ATCD"), was provided with the names and addresses of the 156 absent class members who were deposed in the Brown class action in California. Mr. Alexander constructed a search and reports that he was able to locate 83 of the absent class members in the ATCD and that, of the 83 absent class members who are on PM USA's direct mailing list, 39 of them (or 47%) received the November 1999 "Website Notification Mailing."

In addition, I have looked at the ATCD Reports for those past or current Brown class representatives who appear in PM USA's direct mail database (Tim Carlin, Renee Bernardo and Philip Toole), Of the three individuals, both Tim Carlin and Renee Bernardo received the "99 PM21 Website Notification Mailing" in November 1999.

The specific absent class members who received the website mailing were:

He also said that Philip Morris has never marketed low-tar cigarettes as safer cigarettes and denied that the company meant to imply to the public that those cigarettes were less risky for smokers.

"I do not believe that low tar cigarettes are safer cigarettes," Morgan said.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris Scientist Describes Efforts To Cut Tar Levels

DATE: 22 April 1998

PUBLICATION: The Associated Press

In 1992, Marlboro Ultra Lights were test marketed with 6 milligrams of tar, and by 1994, the company's lowest-tar product, Merit Ultima, had only 1 milligram, he said.

However, Lilly also acknowledged that Philip Morris makes no safety claims about its lower-tar cigarettes.

"I would not tell you reduced-tar cigarettes are safer," he said.

Lilly testified that Philip Morris was trying to respond to consumer demand when it brought tar levels down, as well as when it invested heavily in alternative cigarette concepts.

Lilly also described efforts to develop cigarettes that heat tobacco instead of burning it so that they produce very little tar. One version in the early 1990s, called Project Beta, used battery-powered heating elements controlled by a computer chip, he said.

Lilly testified that Philip Morris was trying to respond to consumer demand when it brought tar levels down, as well as when it invested heavily in alternative cigarette concepts.

Tobacco companies said the descriptive phrases are worthwhile for consumers. "They provide useful points of comparison" for smokers, said Mary Carnovale, spokeswoman for Philip Morris U.S.A., the largest cigarette producer.

"We do not imply in our marketing, and smokers should not assume, that lower-yielding (tar) brands are safer than full-flavored brands,1' said Brendan McCormick. "Philip Morris agrees that there is no safe cigarette."

PUBLICATION: The San Diego Union-Tribune

The tobacco industry agrees that light cigarettes are just as risky as others, but denies any effort to deceive smokers. Terms like "ultralight" and "mild" in cigarette brand names and advertising refer to flavor, said Brendan McCormick, spokesman for Philip Morris USA.

"We use those terms to describe cigarettes that have different taste characteristics," McCormick said. "Philip Morris does not imply in our marketing that lower tar is safer."

Philip Morris has begun noting in its ads that tar and nicotine amounts vary depending on how intensely a smoker puffs, McCormick said. And the company's Web site acknowledges that "if smokers are concerned about the risks of smoking, quitting is by far their best alternative for reducing those risks."

A spokesman for New York-based Philip Morris Inc. denied that the nation's largest cigarette maker was misleading anyone. Labels, such as "light" "mild" and "full-flavored" refer to the cigarette's taste, not its health risks, the spokesman said.

"We do not imply in our marketing, and smokers should not assume, that lower-yielding [tar] brands are safer than full-flavored brands," said Brendan McCormick. "Philip Morris agrees that there is no safe cigarette."

HEADLINE: Star Scientific Phases Out "Light" Term

PUBLICATION: The Wall Street Journal

Star Scientific, Inc. said it will start phasing out use of the terms "light" and ultra light" to describe its cigarettes, and has sent letters to its larger rivals challenging them to do the same. Star said its decision was prompted by the findings of a recent NCI study which criticized the marketing of low-tar cigarettes as "light" and "ultra light," saying the terms were misleading to consumers. Star believes Congress should give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco and ban the use of the terms "light" and "ultra light." Philip Morris supports FDA regulation but does not favor doing away with low tar terms. "We think descriptors such as low tar and light serve as useful points of comparison" for smokers, said spokesman Brendan J. McCormick. He said he favors efforts to provide consumers with more information about what tar and nicotine measurements mean.

Philip Morris said yesterday it would strip claims of "lowered tar and nicotine" from packages of its Marlboro Lights cigarettes, just weeks after a judge ordered it to pay $10.1 billion for deceiving smokers into thinking such cigarettes were safer than others.

Philip Morris USA, the U.S. cigarette unit of Manhattan-based Altria Group Inc., revealed the move yesterday, but said it had made the decision before the judgment in the Illinois class-action suit.

The company said its decision was in response to a 2001 National Cancer Institute report, which found no health benefit from smoking low-tar cigarettes instead of regular ones.

Philip Morris USA will remove the words "lowered tar and nicotine" from packages of its top-selling Marlboro Lights and delete references to low tar on its other cigarettes, spokesman Brendan McCormick said. The company, the top U.S. cigarette maker, said some packs of Marlboro Lights without the wording have been distributed already and it hopes to complete the change by the end of the year.

DEBBIE ELLIOTT: But cigarette makers say they don't market light brands as any safer than resular full-flavor cigarettes.

Bill Phelps is a spokesman for Philip Morris USA.

Mr. BILL PHELPS (Spokesman, Philip Morris USA): Smokers should not assume that brand descriptors such as light or ultralight indicate the actual amount of tar and nicotine that's inhaled from a particular cigarette.

ELLIOTT: Philip Morris has petitioned the FTC to give smokers better information, and is lobbying for legislation in Congress that would shift the regulatory burden to the Food and Drug Administration.
