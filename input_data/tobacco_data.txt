	Q.  And you are a psychologist, not a

19
	medical doctor?

20
	A.  Correct.

21
	Q.  But a big part of your practice, I take

22
	it, is actually taking care of folks who are

23
	dependent on nicotine, trying to help them get off

24
	cigarettes?

	A.  That's what I'm doing, yes.

centers in that regard?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And this is the bulk of your life's work, is it not?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you'll � if it's okay with you, I have a tendency to refer to folks with your credentials as "Doc."  I mean no disrespect.  I just � I just say that.  So if I say that, does that bother you?

A.  Not at all.

A.  Daniel F. Seidman.

Q.  Tell us what you do, please.

A.  Okay.  So when I was a young psychologist, I got asked by the department that I'm part of at Columbia to work with smokers, to run a smoking cessation clinic.

So I've done this for a very long time, and what happens is people try to quit on their own.  They're frustrated.  They're struggling. They're not doing very well.

And they may try to quit on their own, they may try to quit with a doctor.  Either a doctor refers them to me or somehow they find me, and they come in, and they � they want help to stop smoking.  That's why they're coming.

They intend to quit, but for some reason, they're not able to do it, and so they want � they want some help, and what I've found over the years �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, I think we need a question at this point.

They'll do fine, and they go on their way.

Some of them I work with for months or years, and some of those do well, and some of them unfortunately I can't help.

So I wish I could help everybody, and that's not possible, but what I found is that all smokers are not alike.

Some are like apples and some are like oranges, and when I teach the medical students and the psychology doctoral students, I talk about how it's really not the same problem for everybody.

Some people can quit relatively easily on their own.  Some people say it's the hardest thing they've ever done, and some people are not able to do it, unfortunately.

Q.  So when it comes to nicotine dependence, are there varying levels or degrees?  Are all smokers the same with regard to their dependence on nicotine?

A.  No, they're not.  It's not really the same problem, and I think part of what � what happens is if people collapse at all and they say: Well, I know somebody who quit on their own, or: I quit pretty relatively easily.  I didn't really

But you can't generalize necessarily

from your own experience because some people say

it's the hardest thing they've ever done, and they

mean it.

And some people are so frustrated that

they're in a bunker and they feel that they can't

succeed.

Q.  Is your life's work dedicated in trying to figure out ways to deal with smokers of all ilk, regardless of the severity of their dependence?

A.  Right.  Anybody who is not � is not able to quit who would come to me.  I would try to understand them, try to come up with a plan for them, and then work with them to support them, give them some hope, give them some strategies, whether they're behavioral or cognitive, and try to help them to quit as best I can with everything I know about the field.

Q.  Do you have to work with some of the intractably addicted smokers, the ones that are toughest to treat?

A.  Well, I have made that a specialty of mine, the so-called hard-core smoker or the

A.  New York State.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And can you tell the jurors, how do you evaluate a smoker, please?

A.  Okay.  So when � I've been doing this for a long time.  So when somebody comes in, I'll say to them:  Tell me � tell me why this is hard for you to quit.  What's going on?  How did you get into this, and why are you having a hard time?

And they'll start telling me what happens when they try to quit, and I'll be listening for the story.

For example, when I'm reading through the depositions for Mr. Shulman, he says that at 10:00 at night one night, he ran out of cigarettes, and he couldn't stand �

to lodge an objection or not.  We transitioned

from the general to Mr. Shulman.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Ask your next

question.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  I was asking you about how you evaluate a smoker.  You started to tell us, and then you transitioned to something about my client, Mr. Shulman.

A.  Right.

Q.  I'd like to ask you:  In your evaluation of smokers, give us an example that's applicable to Mr. Shulman, as you were saying, please.

A.  Okay.  So when they're telling you a story, you're listening for, you know, what's important, what you think is going to be important that you need to pull out of it.

And when I read the � the many, many volumes of Mr. Shulman, one thing that happened to him is that it was 10:00 at night one night; he ran out of cigarettes, and he couldn't stand it so much that he called a man who owned a pharmacy that he knew and he asked him to open the pharmacy so that he could get cigarettes.

Now that's an unusual story, in my

up in the middle of the night to smoke.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Don't interrupt.

I don't think he should interrupt him, but I understand.  I'll direct it a little more �

THE COURT:  Hang on a second.  Let me see the objection.

Okay.  Sustained.  The jury should disregard the last answer that the witness gave. It's stricken from the record.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Okay.  So if a man such as Mr. Shulman � A.  Yeah.

Q.  � gave you a poignant example of having such a powerful need for cigarettes that he asked someone to open up a store that was closed that he could get them, is there a correlation to that with what you began to say about waking up in the middle of the night to smoke, and why is that important when assessing the depths of the dependency to nicotine that smokers have, please?

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Is there a correlation or not between asking someone to open up a store in the middle of the night to allow someone to buy cigarettes to smoke and the criteria of smoking or getting up in the middle of the night to smoke, please?

A.  I mean, it sounds like someone is desperate for a cigarette.  That's what it sounds like to me.

And so I'm making note of that, you know, or if they're getting up in the middle of the night to smoke, it's somewhat unusual to do that.  So I'm making a note of that �

Q.  So �

A.  � or if they're getting up in the morning early to smoke, I'm making a note of that.

Q.  Okay.  So now bring this back home to your methodology.  What is this about looking for the story?  You were explaining that to us, how you look for the story when you interact with a smoker, please.

A.  Well, a lot of smokers say that they want to guit, and they intend to guit, and they

happened.

Were you � were you � what was the

situation?  How � what is the ring of it?  What

does it � what does it seem like?  Why is it so

desperate for you to guit smoking?

And what's happened to your confidence,

because we know what happens to a lot of smokers

is, when they fail, they go into kind of a bunker,

and that failure makes the next guit attempt

harder.

So no matter how much they want to do

it, sometimes they just start to believe that they

can't do it and they can't live without the

cigarette.

So those are the kinds of things I'm

looking for.

Q.  So in your typical clinical setting when you have someone that is coming to you to help them with their nicotine dependence, you say your assessment is to get the story, and you explained that.

A.  Yeah.

Q.  When you assess them, is the first thing you do � or is there anything you do like to

determine whether or not they're dependent?

A.  Well, I don't do that because I'm very experienced.  So I can get the feel of it pretty quickly.

And when they start to talk to me about it, I start to understand � it all comes out.  It all comes out in the story.  I don't have to sit there with a paper-and-pencil checklist.

I mean, later, I can do that.  I can � I can score something, but I don't typically have to do that because I can tell pretty much where the problems are.

I'm listening to figure out where the problem is so when I give them a plan to address quitting, that it makes sense to them.

The important thing is that it makes sense to them, makes sense to me, and then we can work together to help them stop smoking.

Q.  And do the folks � the folks that you treat in your clinical practice, which we'll � by the way, how many � how many smokers, addicted or � strike that.

Q.  So to the extent the jury is listening, if we do occasionally use words like "dependence," "abuse," "addiction," you mean the same thing by it?

A.  I do.

Q.  Okay.  How many smokers have you taken care of and treated, please?

A.  So over all these years, I figure I've either treated myself or supervised over a thousand cases of smokers.

And so I have a sense, a baseline sense of, you know, whose got a mild case, whose got a moderate case, whose got a severe case.

I can kind of � I have a baseline to try to understand what that means for this disorder, tobacco use disorder.

Q.  Okay.  And then � the default proposition, these smokers that you're taking care

as soon as they come in the door as to whether or

not they're addicted?

A.  No, I have a totally open mind.  My attitude is that � I don't know who is going to quit and who isn't.

And my job is to support them, give them hope, to do everything we possibly can to get them to quit.

And my hope is that everybody will quit, and that can be heartbreaking when people don't or they get ill or they already are ill.

And if you can't help them, it's very upsetting, but that's part of my job.

Q.  And I asked it inartfully.  What I was trying to establish with you is whether or not the default proposition, your understanding of the patients that come to you, whether your default understanding is they're dependent on the nicotine cigarettes?

A.  Well, I think � I think � the ones who come to me have already failed pretty much.  You know, that's how they get to me.

So they're already struggling with it. So they're going to have some level of dependence

Page 5511 typically, or else why would they come?

If they could do it on their own, they certainly wouldn't be coming to me.  These are people that have tried with a doctor.  Most of them have already tried with a doctor and not done well, or they've tried on their own, they're very frustrated, and somehow they find me.

So the guestion in my mind is, is it going to be � you know, can they guit pretty guickly?

And a lot of them do.  Some of them do. Are they going to � are they going to be able to � are they go to be � have to work with me for months or years or whatever?

You know, it's � sometimes the cases get to be much more difficult.

Q.  All right.  In your practice, are you able to identify impaired control in smokers?

A.  I believe so.  That's � I think that's why they're coming.  They intend to guit, but then their intentions are not translated into their actions.

Q.  Why is it hard for addicted smokers to

quit'

most � in our � in our society, we expect people

to do this on their own.

It's a self-help culture around smoking, and most smokers believe it's their personal responsibility to quit on their own.

And what happens is when they try to do it, if it doesn't go well, they � they blame themselves.

They get � they get � they lose their confidence, and then they're afraid to try, and there's a lot of � there's a lot of science about if your efforts and the outcome of your efforts are not aligned, like if you keep trying something and you're not getting the outcome, you'll learn to feel helpless.

And that's what I think a lot of smokers have.  They feel that they can't do it.  They start to believe that they can't do it, and that's part of the problem.

And what � what you do as � as a therapist, or someone who is trying to help them do it, you're trying to build their confidence, you're trying to give them support, and you're trying to challenge some of the beliefs that they

of the problem.

Q.  Is nicotine addiction a psychological

problem?

A.  Well, it's driven by the � by the chemistry, the chemical dependency on nicotine. If you took the nicotine out of the cigarette, nobody would smoke it.

But it has a psychology.  Everybody believes that addiction has a psychology, that people lose their autonomy when � this is part of your guestion about impaired control.

People lose their feeling of will and having self-control, self-government over their own lives.

And that's � that's what they don't like about it, and that's part of why they want to get out of it.

And most smokers would like to guit. Over the years, 75 percent of smokers wish they'd guit.

define real quick.

I'm not going to presume any knowledge

of medical terms, but "autonomy," what does that

mean?

A.  Autonomy is the feeling that you can � you have controls over your � over your own � what you want, you know, your actions, and that it's not compromised, that you're not controlled by something outside yourself, which is part of the problem with addiction is that people feel controlled by � by the drug, by the product, the cigarette, and they feel that their own ability to � to make a choice is compromised.

Q.  Does it � can you say one way or the other, does addiction perpetuate itself?  Is there any cyclical self-perpetuation of addiction, and how do you describe it when you're teaching your � your patients what you're trying to do to help them?  How do you explain that?

Q.  (BY MR. SCHLESINGER)  Do you have a perception �

A.  Yeah.

Q.  � or analogy or what the feeling of nicotine addiction is for patients?

A.  Right.  Right.

I would compare it to driving a car that doesn't have brakes, that you feel out of control, and that each time you take a cigarette, it's like putting fuel into that car.

When you're really addicted, when you're seriously addicted, you're � you're driving a car that has no brakes, and you don't feel in control of that experience.

Q.  You've been working now in the field of nicotine addiction over 25 years?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What got you interested in it?

A.  Well, when I got my first job at Columbia, they said:  We want you to do this, run this smoking cessation program, and they said:

Let's see.

And here I am, over 25 years later still

finding it interesting and challenging.  So that's

how I got into it.

Q.  Interested in loss of autonomy from nicotine dependence?

A.  I'm very interested in that problem, yes .

Q.  Written books on the subject?

A.  Well, I've written a book for doctors to help them with their patients.  I've written a book for smokers.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I've written those two books.

Q.  Are you doing innovations in the field of nicotine cessation, cutting-edge stuff as well?

A.  Well, we tried everything.  We've had � we've had storefronts in Washington Heights. We've worked in corporations.  We've worked in hospital systems.

And I got interested in about the year 2000 in trying to see if we could use the Internet as a tool to help smokers.

Internet system, and then eventually we developed

that.

And there was a national study run by

the American Cancer Society that we participated

in.

And we were the � we were the one that

got the best results.  So we did very well with

that.

Q.  So did you invent a website that you've put out there into the world to try to help folks smoke � quit smoking?

A.  Yeah.  We ended up selling it to something called the American Legacy Foundation.

Q.  I just � I only wanted to show the cover page of it.  It's called BecomeAnEx.com?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And has this become adopted and used by the Mayo Clinic now?

A.  Yes, that's correct.

Q.  And is it the Internet stop-smoking system that you created and invented and put out there?

And doctors also � I teach at a medical school.  They have so many other things they have to do.

Even though they care about this, it's hard to develop expertise and addiction treatment.

It takes time.

So we developed � and really it' s an app that goes on the smart phone that's little videos which are meant to be like sitting down with me, you know, at low cost that people can use to try to help them quit smoking or potentially use with a doctor or a nurse or, you know, any kind of healthcare professional.

Q.  This is the Mental Workout app?

A.  Yes.

And are there, I mean, 50 or 100 short video vignettes of you talking so that you're giving encouragement and support to the � to the smoker as to what copying strategies they can employ to try to get them off the addiction?

A.  Right, trying to teach about behavioral strategies and change attitudes and challenge beliefs and do all the things we would do if we were sitting down with them in person.

A.  Well, you know, it certainly doesn't help.  I think that still in those days people were inclined to believe what tobacco companies said.

And it was unfortunate that the thing they said to the public was different than the things they were saying in private, like, you know:  We have these people hooked, and:  We can keep them forever.

Q.  In the clinical setting, out in the community, in the United States in the communities and the places you work, what are the frontline treatments for folks that have been seeking help with regard to their cigarette addictions?

Who are the � who are the people that take care of those people at the frontlines, in your experience?

A.  Well, in my experience, there really aren't clinics in most of the major medical centers because it's difficult to figure out the funding for the clinics.

So what most smokers are being offered are telephone quitline sessions which help � help somewhere under ten percent of them, or something like that, to quit.

But that seems to be the most � the most prevalent form now of treatment that's available.

You can try to find maybe a psychologist or something, but most � most psychologists don't specialize in this.

Most psychiatrists certainly don't

A.  A very small percentage of smokers get any kind of counseling for smoking cessation.

One � somewhere around four percent of smokers, maybe one and a half percent gets some individual counseling.  Maybe two and a half percent get some group counseling.

Very few people go for counseling, get counseling, and there's very little specialized knowledge available.

Page 5524 It's one of the things that's been very

frustrating to me.  I believe that accredited

healthcare institutions should offer smoking

cessation clinics.

But it's very hard to finance them

that's the way our system works.

Q.  You try to get that word out?  You try to get that word out?

A.  I do.

Q.  And so what about what private care, PCPs � nowadays, in this managed care world we live in, we talk about the internist or the private � the private care practitioner, the PCP. Is � can you tell the jurors, for a lot of smokers who have an addiction problem, whether the PCP is a frontline person that they will go to to try to get some help with some medicine or some patches or some advice?

A.  Yeah.  Well, I think they're supposed to ask about it.  It's part of, you know, the more modern training.  That's what we're teaching them to do, ask about it.

And they believe young � the young medical doctors that I'm treating � not treating,

Page 5525 teaching, believe that it's something that they

should try to do.

But they have so many other things to do, and they don't have that much specialized knowledge about it.  So it's difficult for them.

But it does come up in the course of that, and some of them are more talented about doing it than others.

And that's a large way that I get referrals, is from those people, the primary care doctors, that's what they're called.

Q.  And as we're here today, is your current teaching or your scholastic endeavors beginning to include psychiatric students and psychiatrist doctors?

A.  Well, I think they have other things that they're doing.  Mostly � mostly psychiatrists are not doing this.

But we're going to train � we're going to train the psychiatry department as a whole because, these days, about half the smokers have some kind of psychiatric problem.

That's what � that's what's going on out there.  So it's important to deal with it in the psychiatric population.

younger than the regular � the nonpsychiatric

population, and a lot of that has to do with

smoking.

Q.  What I guess I was going to ask you is, are you involved in launching a program to help teach psychiatrists more about what to do to help folks quit smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And before the implementation of that, can you tell the jurors whether or not the psychiatric medical community, are they firstline smoking cessation counselors?  Is that something they're involved in or not?

A.  Well, I think it's � it's pretty rare that � I mean, most of the � most of the work that's done is probably done by nurses or some psy- � a lot of the psychologists do the research, and a lot of them are interested in clinical work.

But it's very hard to find a practitioner if you're a smoker.  You really � you have to go out of your way, even to find me. People have to � they have to go out of their way to find me.

A.  I've become the � you know, the specialist in this area, the teacher for this.  We don't � there are some other people who have been doing it.

We had � one of the � one of the great early figures in smoking cessation who got me into this is named Dr. Glassman.  He's the one who trained me, and he's no longer living.

So one of his other people that worked with him, Lirio Covey, is still there.  So we're � you know, we're sort of the new generation doing it

conditions.

And we've applied it to smoking cessation very successfully, and it's really unfortunate that it's not widely available to smokers.

And what it is, is it's � the cognitive part is that you � you challenge ideas which are considered maladaptive or that promote a kind of behavior that the person wants to change.

So in this case, a lot of � a lot of the smokers would have the idea that they can't quit.

So you might want to � you'd have to work with to challenge that idea and get them to restructure it and look at it a different way.

A lot of them believe � the severely addicted ones believe that they can't live without the cigarette, which, you know, may be a curious thing to people who aren't smokers, who aren't heavily addicted.

But they start to believe that they can't live without the cigarette, even though that's the thing that's threatening their health.

Page 5530 common criteria you hear from smokers in a

particular severity category?

A.  Yeah, it's a � it's a � it's a � it's an all too un- � you know, it's common thing that I hear that people start to believe that they can't cope with their life, they can't cope with the stress, they can't get through the day without a cigarette, they need the cigarette.

And what we found is that when you do get them to quit, their lives are less stressful, they have less depression and less anxiety, not more.

So it was a myth that was created, I think, through advertising that smoking was a way to handle modern life and the difficulties and the demands of modern life.  I think that was created by the tobacco industry.

Q.  Now this � this particular book, is this one of the first books you wrote?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then is this your more recent book?

A.  That's the book for the smokers, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So this is for the clinicians, and this is for the smokers?

A.  Exactly.

when I reviewed the records.

Q. Did you come to a thorough analysis in your field of specialty to determine whether or not he was addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Yeah, I would characterize him as severely addicted to it.

Q.  All right.  And as an overview of your opinions � and we'11 get into more detail after lunch � Mr. Shulman was severely addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes, is that one of the conclusions you drew after a thorough analysis of this case?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Similarly, that Mr. Shulman's nicotine addiction affected his control over smoking, and he developed a failure syndrome?

A.  Yes, I believe that's correct.

Q. You feel that's an accurate diagnostic description of Mr. Shulman?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you're ready to explain it after lunch?

A.  Yes.

prolonged smoking, leading to the causation of

smoking-related diseases?

A.  I believe that, yes.

Q.  All right.  And that was a conclusion you drew after analysis?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And, finally, that every cigarette contributes to sustain the chain of addiction, is that something you believe about nicotine addiction in Mr. Shulman?

A.  I do believe it.  Every cigarette makes you need the next cigarette, and I believe that was true for him.

Q.  And is that from the nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And, finally, before we stop for lunch, is � if a person smokes � would any person � from what you know about nicotine addiction, would any � is there such a thing � is it possible there is such a thing as a person that would smoke a pack a day of cigarettes for 30 or more years if the cigarettes didn't have nicotine in them?

A    Right.

Q    Extensive interviews and depositions of Mr. Shulman?

A    Correct.

Q    Including examination of Mr. Shulman by a fellow that the defense asked to examine Mr. Shulman as well?

A    Right.  The medical exam, certified medical exam.

Q    There's a lengthy and extensive interview over two days, many hours of data extracting info about Mr. Shulman's lifetime of smoking that you used to incorporate into your thinking?

A    Yes.

Q    Did you thoroughly digest all of those materials?

A    I tried my hardest to do that.

Q    All right.  So what I'd like you to do is � in a synthesis, and I'll guide you as we go, is can you give the jurors sort of a timeline or an

Page 5545 overview of the arc of the trajectory of

Mr. Shulman's longtime smoking going all the way back

to the '30s when he began, please?

A    I believe that the bulk of his smoking started about 1934, '35, when he was 14, 15 years old.  There is some evidence that he might have tried it when he was ten, but when he was a middle school student, he wanted to affiliate with his friends, like all young people do, and they were smoking.  And he joined them and he wanted to be cool, and he wanted to be part of it.  He wanted to find out what it was all about.  He started smoking daily to kind of prove to himself or to be part of it.

And then within about two months he started -- he went from wanting to do it to craving it and needing it.  So it happened very fast for him, which does happen.  There's -- in terms of the science of how quickly this can happen, it's a lot quicker than people think.

So in several months he was a daily smoker. In those days, in the '30s in the depression, money was tight.  He didn't always have money.  He did a lot of odd jobs.  He used all that money for the cigarettes.  If he didn't have money, he would take them out of the street, lit butts or whatever he

One of the interesting things about the

story that stuck out to me was when he was about 16,

in those days they used to make house visits, the

doctor came to the house and he asked him, can you

help me stop smoking?  A 16-year-old kid said, can

you help me stop smoking?

I thought that was an indication he already

knew that he wanted to stop because he was getting in

trouble with school, and it was expensive and his

parents were very unhappy about the expense because

money was tight.  He asked the doctor and the doctor

said, I don't know anything about it.

Q    Back at that period of time, would that be consistent with the public and the medical community's general lack of understanding of the deeply addictive nature of cigarettes?

A    Well, of course.  I think it's been a problem all along.  So one of the things about adolescence � this is considered a pediatric or a developmental disease because teenagers get more of the reward and less of the withdrawal than adults. That's why most of the people who start smoking do so before they're 18.  It's something like 90 percent, maybe 93 percent by 21.  By 27, 99 percent of the

Q    Is that true in Mr. Shulman's case?

A    He was smoking when he was 14.

Q    So was he an adolescent smoker?

A    He was a teen smoker.

Q    Does that � is that consistent or inconsistent with what you know about the nature of nicotine addiction as a pediatric developmental disease?

A    The earlier you start smoking, the more likely you are to have a dependence on smoking, the most likely you are to be a daily smoker, be a persistent smoker, and have a problem with it, that's clearly established.

Q    Since we're still in the pediatric realm with Mr. Shulman, what is it about the vulnerability of the pediatric brain to the exposure to nicotine that seems to latch on in childhood years to create �

A    The brain in maturing -- a lot of the more mature functions are not there and the nicotine gets in the wiring early, as I was saying before, it's more likely to persist and it also does predispose people to other kinds of substance abuse.

Q    You said it gets in the wiring.  What do you mean by that?

A    In the brain circuits, it's -- they're much more impressionable at that age and more likely to become addicted.

Q    That book you wrote, Helping the Hard-Core Smoker, you were the editor and chapter contributor of that book?

A    Yes.

Q    Did you also work with a neuroscientist in that regard?

A    Yes, I did.

Q    In what you do for a living, do you keep current on the research and the studies and what we've learned about nicotine addiction over the years?

A    I do.  But one of the remarkable things about the field and part of why I like it is you can keep learning.  There's thousands and � there's a huge number of studies coming out all the time, so it's a challenge and it's always interesting and fascinating to �

Q    Is the science evolving?

your current experience you feel that cigarettes

addictive than ever?

MR. FURR:  Objection �

THE COURT:  By sustaining it, I struck the last answer so the jury should disregard it.

I'm sorry, what was it?

MR. FURR:  Same objection to this question.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  May I approach briefly, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yes. (Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm trying to stay consistent with your pretrial orders around this.  There's a pretrial order on this where you permitted this testimony from this witness.

THE COURT:  My understanding is, first of all, it's cumulative because you already had a witness for six days on cigarette design.  I allowed the witness to testify on cigarette design.  Why are you asking this witness about cigarette decide?

design.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm asking him why his

job is harder -- his job treating people today

is harder because the cigarettes are more

addictive than ever.  So he's the man in the

A    Yes.

Page 5553 years.  Let's stick with that and let you continue to

fill in and explain what you saw in the biography of

his smoking, please?

A    Okay.  I saw something which I think is very common with a lot of kinds of substance abuse and with nicotine addiction is the progression of the disease, it's a developmental disease.  So at 21 he was smoking a pack.  And then from 25 to 45, he was somewhere between 25 and 30 cigarettes, which would be about a pack and a half.  So he increased the amount.

Also, he was, you know � he had a young family, there were issues with expenses.  He was trying to keep the level down of his smoking for those reasons, but nonetheless, over time it crept up to two packs a day.  So when I'm listening to that, I'm thinking, this is a guy who needs more just to stay even.

Then in the late '60s, around 1970 or so, he switched to the filters.  At that time he was already around two packs.  He went above two packs a day.  According to him, he smoked incessantly.  He smoked all the time.  He lit one from another and that's what his son said, too, that he was constantly craving it.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer that the witness gave. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Did you find the testimony that others observed about his smoking behavior?

A    I did.  I listened to what his son had to say, who was very close to him.

Q    Okay.  So without quoting from what his son said, even though you use these things as the basis of it, what is your conclusion about his smoking behavior based on the materials that you used to come to these conclusions?

Obviously you weren't there, you didn't know him?

A    Right.

Q    Okay.  But reading from the folks that did and incorporating that into what your understanding, your synthesis is in this, without quoting from what someone said �

A    So the totality of what I read looked to me like somebody who had an illness, an addiction that progressed over time, that went from a pack to a pack and a half to two packs, and then with the filters he was above two packs, smoking more and more agitated,

agitated all the time, leaving a lot of social events

early because he wasn't getting enough nicotine and

he needed to go out and get a fix.

Q    Did you see to what extent, if any, the

filters intercepted his opportunity to quit, please?

Argumentative.

Page 5556 Q    In the course of what you do, what's

cognitive behavioral therapy?

A   We challenge the beliefs that keep � a behavior that the person wants to change, we challenge those beliefs, we try to get them to look at it from a different vantage point, to shift where they are, their perspective, and get them to open it up, open it up.  So we would challenge certain kinds of beliefs in somebody who is addicted at that level �

Q    In order to treat patients such as Mr. Shulman, do you need to assess and test for what their beliefs are?

A    Yes.

Q    The same way as a cardiologist might do a blood test to get the results of a blood test, it's a lab test that gives data that the clinician incorporates into thinking about the case?

A    These are the tools of our trade.

Q    Could you practice cognitive behavioral therapy without investigating and learning about the beliefs of the patient?

A    No.

Q    Would you be able to explain to the jury what it is you do or how Mr. Shulman was dependent on

his beliefs were about smoking?

A    No, I think it's very relevant to the problem.

Q    Is it an essential and inextricably integrated component of what you do for a living?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    All right.  So without quoting from him, what was your assessment of what beliefs, if any, he had with regard to filters and what role that played in his nicotine addiction, please?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Necessarily calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    He believed that this was an alternative that was healthier, safer, and less harmful.  He believed this was a strategy for harm reduction and millions of people believed it.  It wasn't a strange belief.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor, as to what other people believed. THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  Move to strike.

Page 5558 THE COURT:  I strike the last answer.  The

jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Is there anything out of the ordinary about Mr. Shulman as a patient and can you tell the jurors whether this is something common in your experience or uncommon?

A    I think with people who are severely addicted they tend to develop certain kinds of beliefs which to me indicates something that has to be tackled if we're going to help them.

Q    Okay.  Did he have a conceptualization of the harm that tobacco might befall him?  Where was he in that regard with regard to his smoking, his addiction, and what role his beliefs about the harm may have played, please?

A    I think that Mr. Shulman believed they wouldn't sell it if it wasn't harmful.  They would never sell a product that wasn't healthy for you.  He believed that.

Q Is that � within the context of nicotine dependent patients that you see, is that a typical, atypical, or outlier belief of any kind?

A    Nowadays I think it's more known how unhealthy it is, but when the filters came out, he

Page 5559 thought that was an answer.  He didn't know if --

there was a question about how harmful it was or not.

It's hard for us to go back to 1970.  It's

45 years ago.  It's hard to believe, but people then

were struggling, is it healthy?  It is unhealthy?  He

didn't know if it was healthy or unhealthy.  He

thought, here is a hedge.  If I get these filters, if

it is unhealthy, the filter is intuitively such a

good thing that it's going to protect me.  He did

believe that.

Q    How does that intercept overcoming addiction, if at all?

A   Well, he never really believed that it was, you know, going to cause serious disease.  He thought he was buying fun, thought he was buying something that was not about disease and not about addiction.

Q    Have you yourself � when you teach students, you teach courses, lifestyle changes and prevention to fourth-year medical students, behavioral techniques to psychology doctoral students, do you include lectures on nicotine addiction in those courses to these medical students?

A    Yes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, Your Honor, the question --

THE COURT:  That's the one that I already overruled.

MR. FURR:  Your realtime is stuck where mine is, Judge.

It was a question about the role of tobacco advertising and how it affected -- that's why I objected.  Dr. Proctor talked about that for a long time.

THE COURT:  Mine, something is not up to date on here.

MR. FURR:  Would you like for us to work on that one for you?

advertising and what role it plays.  So rather than

speak generally about it based on your familiarity, I

want you to apply it to Mr. Shulman.  Can you tell

the jurors, did tobacco advertising have a role in

influencing and contributing to his dependence on

nicotine in cigarettes while he was a smoker?

because I'm asking this man to comment on

Mr. Shulman specifically, when Dr. Proctor did

Q    Do you read all of the materials � I think

Mr. Shulman was deposed over four or five days by the

defendants, thousands of pages of testimony, eight

hours of an interview by a fellow named Dr. Hoge, who

I anticipate they'll bring, who is a psychiatrist

interviewing him, as well as all of the family

members that observed him.

Did you read in Mr. Shulman's depo and his

transcript of his examination report everything he

had to say about what role, if any, he thought the

advertising played to allay his fears about

cigarettes?  Did you read that?

A    I read that, yes.

Q   All right.  Do you feel you have a good understanding to give the jurors a scientific conclusion based upon reasonable degrees of scientific certainty as to, Number 1, whether or not advertising influenced Mr. Shulman's smoking behavior and contributed to his addiction?  Don't give me the opinion.  Tell me whether you have come to that conclusion.

A    Yes.

Q    Is that conclusion based on good science in the practice that you employ every day with your patients?

A    Yes.

Q   Okay.  Do you, in fact, reflect with your patients about the role the advertising played?

A    Yes.

contribution to Mr. Shulman's addiction as a result

of tobacco advertising?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Foundation. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled. Q    You may answer, please.

A    I think whatever doubts he had in his mind about product, he thought that he was making a choice to do the safer thing by switching to a filtered cigarette.  He had some kind of reassurance based on the advertising that that was safer for him, that the filter made a lot of sense to him.

It was intuitively reasonable that that was going to � if there was a problem, which he wasn't convinced there was, because he believed that they wouldn't sell it if there was a problem, if it was unhealthy, if there was a problem, the filter was an answer and he did believe that.  And I think it affected his smoking behavior.

Q    Okay.  So the jurors have already heard that grant money is money for research around things like that but it's competitive, you have to apply for it and get the grant money, right?

A    Yes.

Q    So when it comes to addiction, not just of � let me ask it this way.

Substance abuse in forms of drugs, harder drugs like heroin, cocaine, opiates, maybe even marijuana, nicotine, alcohol, do these drugs have a similar or dissimilar pattern of features that go along with dependence compared to tobacco, please?

A    Well, I think in all these drugs there are differences and they are similarities, but the way � many of the features are similar.  The compulsion to use the drug, the loss of control, and the continuing to use the drug when there are what's called adverse consequences, when there are problems related to it, they all have that in common.  Also, they also work by means of the same circuits in the brain.  They all tend to manipulate the dopamine system �

Page 5568 MR. FURR:  I move to strike the answer and

make a bigger objection.  During the deposition

in this case Dr. Seidman was asked, how do brain

receptors respond to drugs like cocaine and

heroin?  That's what he's talking about right

now.  His answer was, you know, this is just

beyond my scope.  I'm not here to talk about

cocaine and heroin.  That is what he told us

about in his deposition.  This is a bigger

problem, non-disclosed expert opinion.  This was

February 16 of this year at page 805, lines 12

through 16 of his deposition.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Judge, I've got an 800-page deposition, this witness has covered all of these subjects.  I'm not able to in this setting -- if you want to go back and spend 30 minutes.

THE COURT:  Right now I'm going to grant the motion to strike the testimony. (Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.)

THE COURT:  All right.  I've sustained the last objection.  The jury should disregard in its entirely the last answer given by the witness.  It's of no value, no evidentiary value.

THE COURT:  Yes.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    When it comes to talking about the things that trip up or obstacles to quitting, we've talked about advertising.  With nicotine addiction for a patient like Mr. Shulman, when you're trying to treat someone that has a substance addiction, is a clear concise message important to them?  Do you give them hope?  Do you offer them opportunities to quit?  Do you encourage them that they can quit?

A    When they come, I don't know who is going to be able to do what.  I do all of the things that I do with everybody.  I take the position that I don't know what's going to happen and I'm openminded, and I try to help everybody as best I can.

Q    Can you tell the jurors whether or not confusion about an addictive drug, uncertainty, doubt, whether or not that is a problem for people like you that are trying to take care of folks who need to quit cigarettes?

A    One of the jobs of somebody like me is to get them to break out of what's called minimization or denial or the way they try to disconnect from the problem.  You want to get them to take it as

If they think it's a normal behavior, if

they think they need it for stress, if they have the

idea that's going to help them with their depression,

even if those things are completely false, those

things do confuse them.  A lot of those ideas are out

there in society and they've been shown by science to

be false.

you how to answer.  You tell us.

MR. FURR:  Cumulative.  Objection. Cumulative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, it's an epidemic of death and disease. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Is it durable?

A    I don't know what you mean by that. Q    Intractable?

A    Well, we have a similar number of people smoking today as we did when the Surgeon General's report came out.  Now, it's true that the population has doubled, but it's still 45 million people. Q    Why �

A    That's an enormous number of people. Q    Why is it so hard to eradicate?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  There's no foundation for this testimony.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  He just said the foundation in the last three questions. THE COURT:  Sustained.

Q    For instance?

A    That smoking helps with stress.  We know now that addiction is stressful.  Quitting gets rid of your stress.  People who quit have less stress, but everybody believes that smoking relieves the stress --

Page 5575 up in this area, what were you taught, what was your

understanding of the science then with regard to the

beneficent effects of cigarette smoking, please?

A    We were taught it was something called a psychological tool, that it helped you cope with stress, with depression, with anxiety, and that that's what people were really looking for in a cigarette.  All the research shows that it doesn't help with those things, that smokers have more stress, anxiety, and depression, and quitters have less stress, anxiety, and depression.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection to the last

Early on you were taught to believe that smoking relieved stress.  That was the science back then?

A    No.

Q    Okay.  So I'm going to ask the court

reporter to read back the last question that His

Honor overruled the objection to and then you can

answer.

(The court reporter read back the requested portion of

testimony.)

THE WITNESS:  The science today is that it's very stressful to be addicted.  That when you look at smokers who quit, their levels of stress literally go down a year later.  Their depression goes down and their anxiety goes down.  So we were taught that smoking was a way to handle those things.  It turns out that smoking caused a lot of those things.  Smoking is associated with those things and quitting actually makes all those things better.  That's what we can see today from the science out there.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Based upon your evaluation in this case,

did you come to any scientific conclusions, opinions,

based upon reasonable scientific certainty as to

whether Mr. Shulman suffered from what you've seen in

belief syndrome, please?

A   He believed that he needed to smoke to live, and I know that's a strange, strange idea, but it's very common in severely addicted smokers and he had that belief.  It's a false belief because you can't protect your health in any way if you're a smoker.  He believed that he needed to smoke to live.

Q    That book, Hard-Core Smoker, if you apply that to Mr. Shulman, would he meet the criteria or not of what you consider to be a hard-core smoker?

A    By every criteria that we use to measure this, by any measurement tool, he is at the high end of nicotine addiction.  He's at the severe end of it.

Q    What do you do � how do you interact � obviously Mr. Shulman is no longer a smoker.  What do you do in patients such as he if you're with them to try to encourage them to believe or re � do the cognitive behavior therapy to change their thinking to encourage them to believe it's possible they can quit?  What do you tell the smokers, say to them? What do you teach them when you're treating them?

medicines, the nicotine replacement therapies and the

other medicines, which I'll -- I work with their

doctor to prescribe if I can't prescribe it.  I don't

prescribe medicine.  But I'll work with them on the

medicines, which actually are not that simple to do

well.  People often under dose themselves and don't

get the proper amounts.

I work with them on behavioral strategies,

how to deal with difficult situations, how to deal

with other smokers, how to deal with stress in

healthy ways, and I challenge the kinds of beliefs

that they have which perpetuate the behavior.

Q    Are you always successful?

A    I wish I was.

Q    All right.  How does it work?  With your patients, what are the different categories of folks and what are your success rates depending on the severity of their addiction, please?

A    Well, as I was saying in the beginning, there are some people I can see once or twice and they do great, they have a mild case, they're fine. That's always a nice thing to see.

Other people have to work a lot harder at it and maybe a little longer period of time to quit.

Now, I mean, at this juncture, I would -- just for the Court for the record, Your Honor, I will be proffering a couple of the excerpts of those videos from his app � you already ruled on, but just so the record is clear, this is where I've made the proffer of those you've already ruled on, the little short minute videos.  I would like to show the jurors this slide and ask you to help define for them �

THE COURT:  Are you making a proffer of the demonstrative?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It was the videos that we were talking about.

THE COURT:  Those were just the demonstratives?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Yes, we proffered �

THE COURT:  I don't think you proffer demonstratives.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  I'm sorry. THE COURT:  Let's move on. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    At this juncture is there any established single consensus definition of what tobacco addiction, tobacco abuse, tobacco dependence is?

A    Well, the addiction I would go by is that it's a compulsive behavior, the smoking, that involves a loss of control and adverse � despite adverse consequences.

Q    All right.  We put this up.  Addiction is defined as a chronic relapse in brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug-seeking and use despite harmful consequences.  Is that one of the ways you think about it?

A    That's one of the definitions, yes.

Q    All right.  When we did talk about your book and we were talking about advertising, if you want to say it in a word, if you want to show it in a word, is daily smoking or chronic smoking a form of drug addiction?

A    If you smoke every day, your brain will adapt to that and you will expect it.  So, yes, it's

Most people who use it every day will have changes in

their brain, which could have serious consequences to

them.

Q    And then even in your book you have sections entitled How the Media Created Our Cultural Beliefs About Smoking, you talked about that, right?

A    Yes.

Q   You talked about the role of the tobacco industry in creating a false belief syndrome?

Q    Mr. Shulman suffered from a false belief syndrome created by the tobacco industry?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative today. MR. SCHLESINGER:  This is a different

question.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    I think it's clear that he did.  He believed they would not sell the product if it was unhealthy.  That's what he believed.  He believed a major American corporation would never do that.

Q    I want you to assume that this jury has heard evidence and seen documentary evidence

THE COURT:  Sustained. MR. FURR:  � a question. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    So let's show this.  Is this also, in your teaching, your � when you're teaching and trying to explain to folks why they're having such a hard time quitting, folks like Mr. Shulman � which, by the way, does Mr. Shulman fit into the category of what we call a generic smoking?  Were his smoking patterns like some of the others you've seen?

A    I was trying to explain in the beginning that there's really apples and oranges, there's people with the mild kinds of addictions, it's much easier for them to stop, and then there are people with severe addictions and I believe he fits into the later category.

Q    Within that category, does he fit the picture in that category in the way that is recognizable to you as generic of all of the others that fit in that category?  Is it typical or

A    It has a lot of the hallmarks of what I would be looking for when I would be trying to assess that.

Q    Do you try to explain or teach � when your patients have a question, why are you still smoking even though you want to quit, do you describe the tobacco changes the brain's chemistry and hijacks the body's own pleasure system, the endorphins, creating a dependency on the outside action, in this case smoking, to alter the mood?  Do you teach that?

A    Yeah.

MR. FURR:  Leading.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer.  Please ask your

question. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Let me ask it this way.  Is this something you teach?

A    Yes.

Q    Will you read it to the jury, please?

A    Tobacco changes the brain's chemistry and hijacks the body's own pleasure system, the endorphins, creating a dependency on an outside action, in this case smoking, to alter mood.

Page 5585 Q    Now, do you feel that's a currently

scientifically accurate description of the problems

you have with taking care of your smokers?

A    Well, I think a lot of the research involves the dopamine system, but I think the endorphins are involved.  Many of the different neurotransmitter systems are involved in this.  So the basic principle is the same, that people feel that they've lost their ability for self-control, self-government of their will, of their actions, if they're taken over by a product that's coming from outside them that has a chemical basis.

Q    As I'm going through this, I'm sort of weaving in some of the things I know you do professionally, but besides the web site that you've developed that the Mayo Clinic has, besides the app you can get at the Apple App store for a phone on the mental workout and how to quit, the public videos, you've got your own web site up, don't you?

A    Yes, I do.

Q   What's that called?

A    That's based on the book.

Q    Okay.  Is that web site up with ideas on how to help folks quit smoking?

A    Yes.  I run a blog at the Huffington Post

Q    How long have you been a contributing blogger for the Huffington Post?

A    For I think it's five years now, four or five years.

Q   A subject matter of a lot of those posts have to do with getting folks to understand the nature and severity of their nicotine addiction?

A    It's all about smoking and nicotine.

Q    All right.  I have a slide here.  I think we did this but I'm going to hit real quick, Number 9, material review.  We talked about a bunch of it.  So I did it in sort of a fast overview.  Is this some of the materials that you've reviewed?

A    Yes.

Q    How many hours have you spent working on this case?

A    A lot of hours.

Q    How many hours does it take when you're having your first session with a new patient who you're going to try to help quit smoking and get over their addiction?  How many hours do you spend in your initial consultation?

Q Within that hour are you able to assess and determine whether or not they have mild, moderate, or severe dependency?

A    Yeah, I think so, based on my experience and my knowledge of the field and the problem.

Q   Okay.  So when it comes to Mr. Shulman, was your assessment and determination that he was suffering from tobacco dependency that was driving his smoking behavior for all those years, was that a complex or difficult assessment to do or conclusion to arrive at?  Was that difficult for you?

A    No.

Q Was it a cloudy, muddy, or uncertain case from your perspective as a clinician?

A    No.

Q   So you also got a chance to fill in the blanks and speak with Mr. Shulman a little bit?

A    Yes.

Q I don't think you met him before today, did you?

A    No, we never said hello.

Q Okay. Now, when you interviewed him, did you ask any questions of him in particular? Do you remember anything you interacted with him about in

A    Well, I did ask him if he smoked when he was sick.  I didn't see that in the record.

Q    All right.

A    He said he did.

Q    All right.  So can you tell the jurors, after you assessed him and � did you assess him across all of the batteries and formal instruments that help evaluate smoking?

A    I did.  I mean, it's important to use more than one measure because the different measures tend to look at a different piece of the problem.  So I used three different measures and I scored them.

Q    Okay.  Okay.  Did you need to do that to figure out that Mr. Shulman was addicted and that was what was driving his smoking?  In other words, in the clinical setting would you do that in the � do you do that in your clinical setting where you're actually treating your patients?

A    I think in the course of getting the story I learn everything I need to learn.  Things come out.

Q Okay. I want the jurors to know whether or not in your practice do you actually administer these batteries of tests?

A    I don't administer them as such, but I'm

I need to know.

Q    The key features from those instruments �

A    Yeah.

Q    � are within your awareness when you diagnose?

A    Yes.  What are the withdrawal symptoms, what are the key predicters of quitting, for example, time to the first cigarette in the morning is a key thing, and he had three or four cigarettes right away before he was even awake, he said.  Or how many cigarettes a day you smoke, some instruments measure that, some don't.  So we needed a combination of instruments to sort of get at all of the different criteria that are relevant to making the assessment.

Q    So after your review, did you � we already talked about him being dependent, addictive, can you tell the jurors did you come to a conclusion as to whether or not that dependence within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty drove the smoking that you saw in Mr. Shulman?

A    Well, I don't think there's any question about that, because he's pretty clear that after the initial time when he enjoyed it with his friends, he didn't enjoy it.  He felt he needed to do it.  He was

Page 5590 driven to do it.  For decades and decades he was

smoking more and more and more because of the

chemical dependency.  It wasn't that he was doing it

because he was enjoying it.  It wasn't because he was

having a good time.

He's what we call a negative reinforcement

smoker, somebody who smokes to stay even, somebody

who smokes to get rid of a bad feeling.  That's what

he is.  If he wasn't addicted to the nicotine, he

never would have touched it.

Q    What is the avoidance of withdrawal that you see in the kind of tobacco dependence that Mr. Shulman was suffering from, please?

A    I think, you know, it may be hard to picture exactly, but the symptoms of nicotine dependence are very similar to the symptoms of clinical depression.  In a severe case, it looks like that.  A lot of the symptoms that he described are the kinds of things someone would go through if they were going through a severe clinical depression, which is a horrible thing.

Q    Did you come to any conclusions as to whether or not the way in which Mr. Shulman changed his smoking, his smoking behavior, the kinds of cigarettes he smoked, and how much he smoked allowed

Page 5591 you to conclude whether or not he had demonstrated

what's called compensation one way or the other?

A    I came to the conclusion that he had that because when he switched to the filters, he couldn't get the satisfaction out of them, and he upped his smoking guite a bit.  He was agitated all the time. He wasn't getting satisfied from the cigarette.  He needed that nicotine.  He was very clear about that. He couldn't get enough with the filter.  He had to puff on it harder.  It still wasn't enough.

Q   Then we had one part of that slide about the dependence contributed to cause his tobacco-related diseases.  Do you believe that was true in Mr. Shulman's case?

A    I don't think there's any guestion because he wasn't �

Q    I want you to assume hypothetically there's medical testimony in the record that Mr. Shulman's smoking caused his bladder cancer, his heart disease, and his COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. You know about these illnesses and injuries as a consequence of tobacco dependence already in your role, don't you?

A    Yes, I work with these patients all the time.

Q    Okay.  In that regard, assuming that's true, I want you to look at the other end of it.  Can you tell the jurors if that's true, from your perspective as a nicotine addiction researcher and clinician, whether the nicotine addiction substantially contributed to those diseases, please? MR. FURR:  Same objection.  Calls for a

medical opinion.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Does nicotine addiction cause or contribute to cause diseases that are caused by smoking?

to diagnose these types of things.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's fine.  The problem with the cumulative issue is this, Judge. They're going to and they have made the argument that the witnesses who have thus far discussed addiction are not properly trained in the areas to assess addiction.

THE COURT:  This is not a medical doctor either.

MR. GDANSKI:  I understand.  This is the point, Judge.  He deals with nicotine addiction �

THE COURT:  Are there other doctors who you can ask that question?

MR. GDANSKI:  No.

MR. FURR:  Dr. Soloway.  Dr. Bernsley.

MR. GDANSKI:  Wait one second.  Dr. Soloway never discussed addiction.  The word never came out of his mouth and that's not accurate. They're attacking Dr. Bernsley and saying he's not an addiction expert.  There is plenty of

MR. SCHLESINGER:  No, no, the psychologist treats the smoker so as to give them a chance to avoid their disease.  You have to know what the disease is, he has to teach what the disease is,

THE COURT:  Sustained

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Okay.  Tell us what, if anything, you tell smokers related to what will happen if they don't stop smoking, please.

A    Smokers are very intelligent and they know nowadays that it's a dangerous product.  I don't think that was true historically and I don't think that Mr. Shulman believed that.  So the fact that he thought they wouldn't sell it if it was unhealthy is a serious problem because it gave him false reassurance and made, you know -- and made him think that he had taken care of a problem already.  So I think today it's a different story.  I think people now know, people know that's a dangerous product mostly.

Q    All right.  Let's just look at this slide 36.  I've taken the heading off.  Can you tell the jurors, if things like the amount of smoking, and we're taking a composite of his smoking history, say 30 cigarettes a day for 40 years, which would be almost half a million cigarette in a lifetime, 438,000 cigarettes in a lifetime, if you average on the low end of eight to ten puffs per cigarette, that's 3 1/2 million lifetime exposures to the toxins

explain to your smokers they're undergoing as part of

their ongoing dependence?

A    I'm not trying to scare them to death.  I'm trying to help them quit smoking.  They're already scared to death.  They're already desperate.  That's how they find me.  They're desperate to quit and they don't know how to quit.  They're worried about this already when they come to me.

Q    Do you have to interact with them in that regard?

A    They're concerned about their health. They're worried about it and they don't know what to do about it.

Q    How do you teach them that the danger is in the excessive compulsive smoking that nicotine addiction drives, meaning a pack a day, 20 cigarettes a day, how do you teach them that that's where the danger is?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Do you teach them and do you counsel them that that's where the danger is?

Page 5601 they understand that this is dangerous and something

they don't want to do, but there's a disconnection.

It's called denial.  We've all heard about what

denial is.  It's a disconnection between the

intelligent smart brain that is worried about the

behavior and the part of the brain that is compelled

in the mid brain to continue and repeat this

experience.

And there is -- there's science now that

shows that the parts of the brain that inhibit and

control this behavior are actually damaged in

addiction, that there's less brain matter there.  So

there's actually a biological basis for this �

MR. FURR:  Excuse me, Your Honor, the

question was, do you teach them and do you

counsel them, that's where the danger is?  I

move to strike this as nonresponsive.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Do you teach them and

counsel them about their medical consequences to

try to help them to quit?  It's perfectly

responsive, Your Honor.

Cancer Institute, the American Heart Association, the

National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer

Society, the World Health Organization, the National

Health Service, the Mayo Clinic, the Surgeon General,

have you studied and learned about all these

different sources of information on nicotine

addiction?

A    I think the amazing thing is that there's a consensus among all these major health institutions that nicotine is a powerfully addicting, life-threatening, dangerous drug.  They all agree on that.

MR. FURR:  Objection.

MR. BRENNER:  Bolstering.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer given.  It's not of

any evidentiary value. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

These concepts, can you tell the jurors

within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty

your understanding of the intense severity of

nicotine addiction?  Is it all of these items here on

this slide?

A    Yes.

Q    It's very addictive, powerfully addictive, highly addictive, is this what the current science is?

A    There's no question about it.

Q   Similar to the addiction by using drugs as heroin and cocaine?

A    Yes.

Q   As addictive as heroin and cocaine?

A   People who go into rehab for those drugs say it's harder to quit smoking often.

Q   You've treated folks like that and they've had more trouble quitting smoking than getting off of heroin?

A    Yes.

Q   So does nicotine addiction affect folks emotionally as well as physically?

A    It does.  It creates a kind of insecurity,

talking about this before.  That belief that they

can't live without it is part of what drives the

compulsive behavior.

Q    Define what you mean by compulsive

behavior, please?

A    The person has a strong preference to do

this versus not doing it.  There's pressure on them

that has a biological basis to repeat an experience

that they've learned is a powerfully -- it releases

powerful chemicals in the brain that are really

designed to help us with things like eating and

mating, things like that, those chemical messages get

hijacked by the nicotine and produce a powerful

pressure on the person to repeat the behavior over

and over again.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  So � and let's just show this Number 34 real quick, please.

MR. FURR:  We're going to object to that.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  We have a ruling on this.

MR. BRENNER:  Your Honor, just to be clear, you also told us we could take up the sourcing �

MR. GDANSKI:  The model has been removed. It's been removed.  On the one we're showing it's been removed.  We just didn't have time to print it all out again.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Did you kill the sound?

Q    I'm going to have you narrate it then, please.

A   What happens when you take a cigarette because of inhalation is, it goes quickly into the brain, very quickly in seconds, that's part of what makes it so addictive.  It goes into the cells.  It fits into the cells like a key into a lock.

There are cells in the brain that are designed for acetylcholine that nicotine fits right into.  That's what it's showing, how the lung is rich with blood that goes right into the brain, the cells become adapted to it.  That's where it fits into the receptor of the cell, the nicotine.

Q    Is this actually a brain cell?

A    It looks like it.

Q    Is it the dendrite, that part of the body, the brain cell?

A    Right.

Q    Go ahead.

A   What happens with nicotine is so powerful

Q    What is happening?  Are these the release of neurotransmitters caused by the nicotine?

A    Yes, dopamine.

Q    Okay.

A    Most of the nicotinic receptors in the mid brain release dopamine.  That's a big concern with nicotine researchers.

Q    All right.  So then you've got the dendrite, you have the axon, and these are the drugs going into the receptors in � the nicotine receptors in the brain?

A    Right.

Q    What happens to the nicotine receptors in the brain over time when the pediatric brain, for instance, is exposed to nicotine?

Page 5609 normal pleasures.  So because they release two to ten

times more dopamine than you would normally get

because you achieved something -- dopamine is

something that's goal oriented.  If you got a good

mark on a test, you'd get a little dopamine.  If you

accomplished something that you were proud of, you

would get a little dopamine.

But if you got two to ten times more

dopamine just for smoking a cigarette, it tends to

damage that system.  Then when you don't have it, you

can't get the normal pleasures.  That's what's called

withdrawal.

Q    All right.  Continue with that, please.  So what happens when the nicotine receptors are empty? If Mr. Shulman, for instance, is trying to be abstinent for a few hours from cigarettes, what happens?

A    It's more extreme for some people than other people, but they're hungry.  He talks about the hunger and that's called nicotine hunger.  It's part of the craving.  It's difficult to describe what it is, but it's an overbearing, overwhelming craving to use the substance that in this case the product which is the cigarette.

Page 5610 So with regard to this concept that

nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason

individuals persist in using tobacco products and

this persistent use contributes to many of the

diseases from smoking, is this something you're

familiar with as the current understanding of

science?  Is this something you work with in your

mind, that you know about?

A I don't think the people would smoke a cigarette that didn't have nicotine in it. They would reject it.

Q    In your assessment of Mr. Shulman, were you able to make a determination one way or the other as to whether nicotine addiction was the fundamental reason why he persisted for � smoking cigarettes for approximately 40 years of his life?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Cumulative multiple

times already within this examination, Your

Honor.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's a completely

different question, Judge, with all due respect. THE COURT:  I'll overrule it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A    I don't think he was doing it because he

Page 5611 was having fun with it.  I think he wanted to get rid

of it as a teenager.  That's one of the striking

things, he wanted to get rid of it then, and it went

on for decades and decades, not because he was having

fun or enjoying it but because he was addicted to it

and he felt compelled to do it.  That's why it

persisted over the decades.

Q    So let's go to number � slide Number 21. I want to talk specifically about Bob's addiction and give us a little bit of the specifics that lead you to the conclusions you've given.  We started and got partially through his life talking about his biography of smoking.  You got a little bit along the way.  We'll continue with that now.  Can you do that?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  So the key features of addiction, we're looking at slide 21.  Explain to us what this means, how you interface with this.  Please explain this to the jury.

A    Two of the primary criteria that are there are really some of the most reliable ways to predict how somebody will do when you try to quit smoking. One is the time to the first cigarette.  Nicotine researchers are very, very involved with that concept.  It predicts how well someone is going to do

Page 5612 when they quit.

In this case with Mr. Shulman, he said he

started smoking before he even got out of bed, before

he was even awake he'd have three or four cigarettes

with his morning coffee, it's clear that he met that

criteria.

Q    You focused right in on this, this one, time of first cigarette.  What do you know that the science tells you about the predictive power of that particular single symptom in assessing the severity of dependence of a smoker like Mr. Shulman?

A    I think it's the best way to predict what will happen in a month.  It's hard to predict more than that.  A month out, if somebody does that, they're going to have a much harder time quitting. That's established, you know --

Q    Is this a validated criteria?

A    Yes.

Q    Tell the jurors what that means.

A    Well, it's been shown to correlate with other behaviors, other kinds of things like whether you quit or not in a month.  So it's -- it correlates with other things.  That's part of what validation

means

Is it part of what's called the Fagerstrom

Page 5613 Test of Nicotine Dependence?

A    Yes.

Q    The jurors have heard some of that.

A    You get three points for that right off the bat.  So if I saw that and I saw that he smoked 30 cigarettes or more a day, he's got six points.  He's way along in getting a high score on the Fagerstrom. I know right away he's going to score high on the Fagerstrom.

Q    Is there another battery?  You mentioned three, the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, the DSM and the Fagerstrom �

A    Yes.

Q    � are different instruments for assessing nicotine dependence, the severity of it, propensity of smoking when he gets sick.  What about is there another one called the heaviness � what is that?

A    The Heaviness for Smoking Index.  It's really a shortened version of the Fagerstrom.  It basically said that two items in Fagerstrom have a lot of predictive validity, and the two items are, how many cigarettes you smoke a day and the time of the first cigarette.  Just those two items, if you got that information, you would extract a tremendous amount of knowledge about how addicted the person

was

Q    All right.  Has that been peer reviewed and statistically tested and published many, many, times in the scientific literature, that's the kind of stuff you study?

A    It's been around.  It's a finding that's very, very reliable.  It's been around for a long time.

Q    Is it in the armamentarium of any responsible smoking cessation expert to use?

A    Yes, it would be an oversight not to look at that.

Q    Keep going through this, did Mr. Shulman meet the criteria for time of the first cigarette?

A    There's no question about it.

Q    How about persistent daily use, was he a regular smoker of cigarettes daily?

A    He couldn't go for very long without them.

Q    What's the significance of that?

A    That's -- the example that struck me in reading through the depositions was when he ran out of cigarettes, he had no cigarettes and he couldn't stand it anymore, he called somebody that had a pharmacy and he asked the guy to open the pharmacy so that he could get a cigarette at 10:00 at night.

Page 5615 That's a very unusual story that you -- you

don't hear that story often with somebody called

tobacco use disorder.  Maybe for a heroin addict or

something like, that someone with heroin abuse, but

that's a pretty extreme reaction for this disorder.

Q    All right.  Did you see other examples in Mr. Shulman's historical behavior that corroborated some of these extreme examples you're explaining and offering to the jury?

A    Well, I thought his getting up in the middle of the night was one.  Only about 15, 16 percent of smokers smoke as soon as they get up in the morning, so that's also somewhat rare.

The fact that he asked the doctor for help as a teenager, he wanted to quit and couldn't do it as a teenager and asked the doctor, that's an unusual story.  I would be listening to that story.

Q    Was there anything in 1936 that doctors had with regard to understanding that cigarettes were even addictive or how to treat it �

A    He didn't have anything in his black bag for Mr. Shulman.

Q    Okay.  The amount smoked per day, did he have features that were consistent with addiction because of the amount he smoked per day?

Page 5616 A    Well, I think one of the things I looked

for is, does it increase over time?  What is the

pattern?  Called the progression of the addiction.  I

found he smoked solidly a pack around 21, that he

went up in young adulthood to 25 to 30 cigarettes,

that he was moved up to two packs a day, even before

he switched to the filters.

Then after he got the filters he was

frustrated because he couldn't get the nicotine out

of it.  He had more than two packs a day, and he said

it.  He said it in the medical exam that he had with

Dr. Hoge.

Q    How long did Mr. Shulman smoke based on your synthesis of these records, please?

A    Well, I found this a source of confusion. Some of the medical records says he stopped in '75, one says '72, one says '82.  Maybe he smoked 40 years.  In his deposition he says he didn't quit until the mid '80s, the late '80s.  One thing that occurs to me is that he had trouble, he couldn't smoke in the movie theaters, that didn't happen until I think the late '70s or '80s.

Q    Do you mean the banning of smoking in the movie theaters?

A    That's when they banned smoking.  He was

Page 5617 having trouble with that.  He had to leave.  He said

he left his wife there, he couldn't remember the

plot, and that was a problem, she was unhappy about

that.

Q    Do smokers quit and relapse?

A    That's the most likely outcome of trying to quit smoking is a relapse.

Q    All right.

A    Only 3 percent of them make it, so if � basically a lot more people than that try every year, many more people.  In fact, surveys over the years have shown that 75 percent of smokers want to quit and only 3 percent do.

Q    Okay.  So let's look at some of � did he meet all these criteria?

A    I believe so.

Q    Are there any other criteria that he didn't meet or that were equivocal?

A    I didn't think so.  I went through all of the measurements and I thought that he met the criteria.

Q    Whether he smoked and quit in the mid '70s or the early to mid '80s or even as late as the '90s, according to some observers, does he meet these criteria?

A

Yeah

Q    Now, let's look at � you used the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.  That was one of the formal diagnostic tools you used?

A    Yes.

Q    All right.  Let's look at that.  I don't know if the jurors have actually seen what this test is.  Let's show it to them.

All right.  So who is Fagerstrom?  What is Fagerstrom?

A    Carl Fagerstrom is one of the � sort of the granddaddies of the field in the dependence field, and he developed this test and he has become very well known for this test.  He is I think from Sweden.  He sent me materials.  He's been very kind about it over the years in terms of corresponding. This test is the most widely used assessment for nicotine dependence in the field, in the field of nicotine dependence.

Q    In recent years did he actually sell his nicotine gum company to R.J. Reynolds.

A    I've heard that.  It's a little disheartening to me but I have heard that.

Q    With regard to this test, though, is this still a widely used test?

the field.

Q    Does Reynolds even use this test to this

day?

A    I don't know what they do.  I don't spend much time on their web site.

Q    All right.  Fair enough.  Let's look at what the features of this test are, please.  Can you tell us what they are?

A    The first one is, how soon after you wake up in the morning do you take your first cigarette? That has been, you know, one of the tried and true criteria of this whole thing.  It's a way to predict what's going to happen when somebody tries to quit.  Of course he scores the highest within five minutes.  He gets a three.

The second one is, do you find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it's forbidden?

Well, yes.  Especially in later times he avoided restaurants.  He avoided movies.  He avoided even visiting family members that he loved.  He would leave quickly because he was so anxious to have a cigarette.  So I gave him a one for number 2.

up'

I couldn't get an answer to that.  I gave him a zero.  I thought basically he was saying he didn't have a preferred cigarette. Q    Okay. A    So he got a zero on that one.

How many cigarettes a day did you smoke? It progressed over time, and I think it's fair to give him a 31 or more based on the historical record of where the addiction progressed and where it went. So I gave him a three, so that takes us up to seven.

Then do you smoke more frequently during the first hours after awaking than the rest of the day?

No.  The answer was no.  I gave him a zero. Because he smokes evenly throughout the day.  That's what he told me.  I think when I spoke to him.

The last one is, do you smoke even if you are so ill that you're in bed for most of the day?

The answer was, yes, he does. Q    Is that significant?

A    Yes.  It's significant.  A lot of people � sometimes people are able to quit when they get sick because they just don't feel like smoking.  Even though how sick he was, he still felt like having a

Q    Is there some crossover between these different batteries, the different tests, the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist, the Heaviness of Smoking, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the Fagerstrom, is there some overlap?

A    Well, I think the most important questions in this, the Fagerstrom, are not in the DSM.  That's one of the things that it gets -- most of the tobacco nicotine researchers don't use the DSM.  Some of the epidemiologists do, people that study large groups of people, but most of the researchers don't because it doesn't cover the most important factors here.  It covers other things.

Q    I'm thinking about this business about do you smoke when you're ill.  That's in the Fagerstrom, but it also talks about, do you smoke when you're in bed?  Is smoking in bed something of import to the � to researchers and clinicians like yourself in assessing, for example, problems with nicotine dependence?

A    Smoking in bed is one of the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the DSM, which is the psychiatric manual.  They say specifically smoking in bed is a way that you score one of their

Page 5622 criteria.  It's pretty clear that he smoked in bed

more than once a week.  When -- one of the things he

said about it made me think about how severely

addicted he was.  He said, I didn't intend to smoke

in bed, but I did.  I needed to and I did.  That's

how my mind worked.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  The jury should

disregard the last answer given by the witness.

It's been struck from the record. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Based on what you were able to derive from the record from Mr. Shulman, who you assessed like you would assess any patient, right?

A    I used the same skills that I have in the way I think about these problems.

Q   Do you have to assess � when you assess patients, do you assess such things when you get the story of things like if they're smoking in bed?

A    Well, I'm interested in everything.  I'm interested in that.

Q    Okay.  And by the way, with regard to smoking in bed, what is the � what do you know the science shows with regard to the percentage of folks, addicted folks, the heavy smokers, what is the

Page 5623 percentage that also smoke in bed?

A    Maybe about a third, that's the latest I've seen.

Q    Okay.  Is that � first of all, is it dangerous to smoke in bed?

A    Of course it's dangerous.  The fire departments are always worried about that.  He also did burn holes in furniture.  He burned holes in furniture and clothes because he fell asleep and burned his shirt sleeves.  That's in the record. That's an unusual thing you hear.  That's not something you hear every day, people burning holes in furniture.  That's somebody who's got a big problem with this.

Q    Smoking in bed, a risk of falling asleep and starting a house fire, is that conceptually what you understand to be smoking in a situation where it could be dangerous?

A    Well, it's defined -- it is the criteria they give in the DSM.  To me that's what it means. That's what a risky behavior would be for tobacco use disorder.  That's what it looks like.

Q    Were there jobs that Mr. Shulman couldn't take in his younger life because of smoking and dangerous situations?

Page 5624 A    Yeah.  That's another thing that really

jumped off the page at me, that he turned down a job

during the depression, when money was tight, because

the whole day he couldn't get away.  It was a gas

station and he was going to be near gas.  He knew

that it could blow up.

He didn't take a job and that's unusual.

That's unusual to give up a work opportunity when

money is tight, when there's a depression on, you

know.  So I think one of the criteria there is

interference with work.  He met that criteria in my

view.

Q    Along those lines, cigarettes can be bought in the United States in the '30s all the way up to today, right ?

A    I believe it's a legal product.

Q    So you don't look for � unlike an illegal drug like heroin or cocaine, does nicotine include things like robbing stores or stealing or doing antisocial things to get product?  Is that a proper feature for cigarette and nicotine dependent smokers?

A    No.  I think that would be the wrong way to, you know, look at this.  Maybe for heroin people would break in and steal, but people don't typically do that -- he did take cigarettes from his parents

it, but that's a different story.  He wasn't breaking

and entering to get cigarettes.

Q    So just doing � I guess you had to do this historically, but historically doing the Fagerstrom in retrospect of Mr. Shulman, what did you score him?

A    I gave him an eight based on exactly what I'm telling you.

Q    Let's go to the next slide 36 to show what the different degrees of dependence are based on the Fagerstrom test, when you score it, what it means. Is this what Fagerstrom says the different scores portend with regard to the level of dependence?

A    Exactly.  It's not just because he says it, it's because there's research behind it, but he does say it.  I think one of the things I tell my students is, there's a big difference between the very low dependent smokers in the bottom 20 percent and the very strongly dependent smokers in the top 20 percent that those people really have very different problems.  If you lump them together, you're going to confuse people and you're going to confuse yourself.

Q Okay. You do emphasize that. Do you feel strongly in your practice that there's � that these different kinds of degrees of dependence are

Page 5626 important and significant in the way folks smoke and

understanding what it's going to take to help them

get over their addictions?

A    Yeah.  I think as I was trying to explain, some people, it's not that hard to help them.  Half of the people don't even have nicotine withdrawal syndrome.  The people in the upper half of this chart, yeah, they struggle with it for a variety of reasons, but I think it says there they might have some difficult withdrawal symptoms but they can manage it on their own and so on.

But when you're talking about the top 5 percent, which is where I would put Mr. Shulman, it's talking about a small group with extreme dependence, chances to give up are small.  And they'll have smoking-related disorders, most will have smoking-related disorders, which he had.

Q    So you put him in, you said the top 5 percent of smokers in terms of the level of how extreme his dependence was?

A    Well, that's what the eight means, according to Fagerstrom.  I would do it as well.

Q    Now, Mr. Shulman ultimately did give up smoking?

A    Yes.

Page 5627 Q    So does the fact that you ultimately do

give up smoking and you escape the addiction and

quit, what does that say with regard to the period of

years that you were dependent?  Does that erase it

and mean you weren't dependent during those periods

of years?  Would that be accurate?

A    I think this is a really interesting point. Just because you're addicted doesn't mean you can't quit.  It's just much harder for you than it might be for other people.

So, you know, just because you decide to do something and try to quit doesn't mean that you're going to be able to do it.  If you decide you're going to play the piano and don't know how, doesn't mean that you're going to be able to play Chopin Etudes, or play something that is very complicated when you can't read music.

Some people have a much higher bar to get over than other people.  It doesn't mean they can't get over it.  He quit either when he was -- in '75, '85, or '95, we don't know when, but he did quit.  We know he did quit.  So unfortunately he also got a disease from it.

Q    Well, did you see evidence in the record as to whether cancer is what cured his smoking?

Page 5628 A    Well, there's some indications that that's

true

Q    Now, so let's go to � so it looks to me like starting at four to five you've got over average dependence, six to seven you've got strong dependence and withdrawal, eight to ten you've got the small group with extreme dependence, and what is the total score in this interpretation, I guess it's Exhibit 40?  How does that fit into Mr. Shulman, please?

A    Score over seven your level of dependence is high, you aren't in control of your smoking.  It's in control of you.  When you make the decision to quit, you may want to talk to a doctor.  Well, this is now a more modern approach.  We didn't � you know, mostly people aren't going to their doctors unfortunately.

Q    But is this � why is this therapeutic?  In other words, obviously � it appears that for folks that score over seven they're going to be told or taught, your level of dependence is high, you're not in control of your smoking, it is in control of you. That's not for you, the clinician, that's what the patient hears when they score high?

A    That's the message that you give the

Q    Why?

A    Because you're trying to say that they need some kind of outside help.  It may be a doctor.  It may be -- they have a form of Alcoholics Anonymous for smokers called Nicotine Anonymous.  It may be anything you can do to try to help yourself.  You might need some support by people in your community. You might need anything to help you quit.

Q    Are there drugs that exist now that didn't exist years ago when Bob was deep in his period of tobacco dependence?  Are there modern advances that weren't even available to Bob in early years?

A    Well, there are some very good drugs that have come on, probably -- I don't really have exactly the dates, Chantix I think is a drug that came out in the 2000s, maybe 2006.  Wellbutrin is another drug that's marketed, as Zyban, that's a very, very good drug for smokers.  I don't know if it would have been available for him in the period that he was trying to quit.

Q    The types of things that you saw him do when he tried to quit, did he meet the criteria of what you considered to be withdrawal?

A    Well, I was also struck by that, that this

Page 5630 was an extreme form of nicotine withdrawal that

really had all of the earmarks of a depression.  The

criteria in the DSM for nicotine dependence followed

very closely the criteria in the DSM for depression.

It's a very interesting thing.  People don't put

those two things together very often.

He seemed to have a terrible kind of

depression when he -- he had strained -- his head

hurt.  His body hurt.  His arms were like elastic.

He had a very difficult form of deep depressed

feelings and despondency that reminded me of a

clinical depression.  There seems to be an overlap

there.  There is an overlap between nicotine

withdrawal and clinical depression.  That's I think

what happened when he tried to quit.

Q    How long was he able to � did he try to quit with any frequency?

A    He said he tried dozens of times to quit.

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Hearsay, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Were you able to determine from the record and come to a conclusion as to whether or not there appeared to be attempts for this man to quit?

Page 5631 record.  I think that he -- not from him -- he said

that he tried, and what I believe about the situation

is that he tried and became discouraged.  When he

became discouraged after trying many, many times to

quit and having this terrible experience with

clinical depression or whatever the withdrawal

symptoms were with him, that he gave up, that he

entered into the failure syndrome and was afraid to

try.  Every time his family confronted him about it

he said, I tried, I tried, I tried, I don't think I

can do it.  I know I can't do it.  I can't do it.

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.  Hearsay

again.  I'll move to strike.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  These are the signs and

symptoms of evaluation, Your Honor, necessary

toward this clinician to make an assessment of

the patient would be my argument.

THE COURT:  Do you want to approach?

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Sure.

(Thereupon, the following bench conference began.)

MR. FURR:  Here is my objection, Your

Honor.  My objection is -- I didn't object when

he said, my opinion is that he tried, okay.  He

can do that.  But then when he starts reciting

what Mr. Shulman said, that's pure hearsay.  So

THE COURT:  He's not a party opponent.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  But it's to make someone to make an assessment.  This man in order to make an assessment has to work off of what he's being told.  He doesn't have an x-ray.  He doesn't have a blood test.  He only assesses what the patients tell him.  Those are the diagnostic tools.

(Thereupon, the bench conference concluded.) THE COURT:  I've sustained the last

objection.  The last answer that the witness

gave is struck from the record. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q How long, from your review of these records, was Mr. Shulman able to go without a cigarette during his quit attempts, please?

A    The longest before he finally quit that he reported was 14 months.

Q    14 �

A    Not 14 months, 14 hours.

Q    Understood.

A    The day is getting long here.

Q    Sure.

Of what significance are durations of attempts to quit that only last on the order of hours?  How long does nicotine last when you go through that and puff the nicotine and it shoots to your brain, how long does it last?

A    It has what's called a half life of about two hours, that means half of it is gone in two

Page 5634 hours.  Any time in the first 24 hours the nicotine

symptoms could begin, but for severely addicted

people, they can't even get a day.  So actually

that's a very important diagnostic criteria if you

can't get a day quitting, it's probably because

you're in that 5 percent group.  You can't get that

much time.  You break down before you can get any

time .

Q    Did you see that in Mr. Shulman's case he was never able to go a full 24 hours without cigarettes during the period of time he was heavily addicted?

A    Yes.

Q    Were you able to determine whether or not he intended to try, he tried, he meant to try, he intended it?

A    I think throughout the record he says, I intended to do it.  I wanted to do it and I couldn't do it.  There was a disconnect in him.

Q    Did he try when he went boating?

A He went out boating for five or six hours and tried to quit smoking, and he developed what he called hunger for it, a nicotine hunger.

Q    What is nicotine hunger?  Is that a buzzword to you when you see your patients reporting

it?

A I think the craving can feel like hunger. It's hard to distinguish between actual craving and hunger and anxiety, those things are closely related.

Q    Did you see evidence in the record that he tried to quit when he was scuba diving?

A    Yes.

Q    What do you remember about that?  What was the evidence in the record that you draw out as important with regard to his addiction with regard to scuba diving, attempts to quit during scuba diving?

A    He was a very active guy.  He was trying to use the things that he did all the time as a way to quit, and I think one of the problems with the self-help culture around people quitting a lot of times they'll try ineffective techniques. MR. FURR:  Objection. MR. SCHLESINGER:  The witness is explaining

his answer and the scientific basis, Your Honor,

if it pleases the Court?

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  One of the problems with

ineffective techniques is people are trying to

control the smoking, they stall, they delay, and

the tension builds and builds and then it breaks

about willpower, and it ends up making the

situation worse.

So the ineffective techniques that people

use lead them into kind of a -- feeling

discouraged that they're not able to do it, that

they're never going to be able to do it.  In

fact, that's what he ended up believing, after

trying everything he knew how to try, he was a

very strong guy, a very self-willed guy, he

wasn't used to failure, but this thing brought

him down to his knees.

BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    What's the first thing he did when he came

up for air after he was done scuba diving?

A    I think he took a cigarette.

Q    Are these the kind of little specific

vignettes that you incorporate into your thinking

about your patients when you're having them tell you

their story?

the jurors, did he demonstrate that he was a �

successful in life or that he had control in other

aspects of his life, did you make a determination

Page 5637 about that as a psychologist?

A    Yeah.  I thought he was a pretty incredible guy and he built a business with several thousand employees.  He broke horses when he was a teenager. He did all these things.  He was a very successful energetic guy who was used to succeeding.

I think this really threw him.  I don't think he knew what to make of this.  I think he was bewildered, which is true for a lot of smokers who are having trouble quitting.  They don't understand it.  They intend to quit and then it doesn't happen. There's a disconnect there.  That's what impaired control is all about.

Q    Did he have problems in his home, social, family life because of his smoking?

A    I think it's really clear in the record from his courtship, his wife hated the cigarettes, and she didn't like his yellow fingernails and she didn't like the smell.  She was allergic it sounds like because she had problems with her eyes and her breathing.  She didn't like the secondhand smoke. She had a problem with it from the beginning.

She loved the man.  She hated the tobacco. She hated the addiction from the beginning.  And they fought about it.  She put signs up on the

anymore.  Stop.  It was a source of contention and

conflict throughout what's been a 73-year marriage

apparently.

THE COURT:  We're going to take a �

Mr. Schlesinger, we're going to take a recess at

3:00, so wrap up your next set of questions in

the next five minutes.

MR. SCHLESINGER:  Your Honor, I will. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    I'm crossing across batteries, but is social impairment, are things like fighting with the family, for instance, did you see evidence in the records whether his wife fully screamed at him sometimes?

A    She screamed at him.

Q    Did you see evidence from him as to whether he wanted to please her, that he wanted to quit for her, did you make a determination that the family dynamic demonstrated that behavior in Mr. Shulman?

A    What I saw was a very loving family.  I see this a lot, that just because you love your family and you love your wife and you love your kids doesn't mean you can quit smoking.

Q    Did he have the failure syndrome?

Q    Is this kind of social tension one of the indicators or criteria that goes along with diagnosing the severe type tobacco dependence disorder?

A    Yes.  It's a diagnostic criteria in the DSM, arguing with your family and having conflict, it's an important indicater of being out of control and having social impairment.

Q    Was it present in Mr. Shulman?

A    There's no question about it.

Q    Did Mr. Shulman demonstrate to you any � from the record that you reviewed, did he demonstrate to you any sort of false senses of reassurance from the kinds of things he thought he was doing?  Let me strike that.

Can an addicted smoker still make choices?

A    I think every human being has choices. It's part of human dignity that we have choices that we can make.

Q    Did he make choices?

A    He did make choices.  He tried to quit on his own, which most smokers believe is their personal responsibility.  Even if they can't do it, they believe they're supposed to do it and take care of it

Page   5640 and  that's   what   he   did.      And  when  that   didn't   work

out, he chose the filters.

Q   Did he get a sense of false reassurance

from those filters?

A    Yes, he did.

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Asked and answered.  Argumentative, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained.

MR. FURR:  Move to strike the answer, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll strike the answer.  The jury should disregard it. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q   Was it reasonable or unreasonable for a patient like Mr. Shulman to believe that the filtration process, that the filtering process is going to make the cigarette safer and allay the risks, if any?

MR. BRENNER:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    You may answer.

A I think it's a brilliant idea. It makes perfect sense to me that a filter would get rid of the bad stuff.  It makes perfect sense.  Why wouldn't

Q    Now, when it comes to � I mean, a rattlesnake rattles its tail.  That's a warning that it's a venomous snake, right?  Through millions of years that rattlesnake will let you know, hey, you get near me, you're in big danger, I can bite you and I will kill you, right?

MR. FURR:  Objection, Your Honor.

Entertaining but leading. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    Forget the entertaining.  What I want to know is this.  Is there anything scary about cigarettes in the era that Mr. Shulman was smoking and addicted and dependent, was there anything on the order of magnitude that would clue him in to some sort of terrifying lethal danger that could give him better motivation?

MR. FURR:  Objection.  Leading and

argumentative.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. SCHLESINGER:

Q    When it comes to the recognition of danger, recognition of a threat to health, in what you do for a living, is that important when it comes to cigarettes?
