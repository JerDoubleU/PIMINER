A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  If you look at that exhibit it's approximately -~ it is three pages, and it's marked RJR-867.  If we look at the top of page 1, it says � at the top center it says Press Release. Below that it says The American Tobacco Company, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17, New York.  And below that slightly to the right it says "For release March 5th, 1962."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And I think we talked about this yesterday. You would agree that a press release from The American Tobacco Company was something that American Tobacco Company would have intended for the news media to publish or write about; correct?

A.  Yes, I mean it's obviously up to the individual press agencies if they want to carry the story, or the press release, but the intent of a press release is to provide it to the various news outlets.

Q.  And if we look at the heading just below the letterhead it says, quote -- the title of the press release is, quote, Heavy smoking group shows longer than average life span.  New research study contradicts anti-cigarette theory.  Not one death

Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And if we look down at the bottom of the page to the last paragraph, it says these findings were made public today in an article by Jacob Cohen, PhD, and Robert K. Heimann, PhD, published in the March 1962 issue of Industrial Medicine and Surgery. Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Dr. Heimann was with the Research Department of American Tobacco Company; correct?

A.  I don't recall.  I'd have to look specifically.

Q.  Would you agree with me that that Robert Heimann is the same witness or same person that you saw testifying on the short video clip earlier in the deposition on behalf of The American Tobacco Company?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  In terms of the former CEO, President?

Q,     If we look at the first paragraph of this press release it says, "The American Tobacco Company sent to employees today results of new research studies covering more than 14 years which, according to the authors, show that 11,000 employees in the company's cigarette factories smoke more, live longer, and have had fewer deaths from cancer or heart disease than the general public."  Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Would you agree with me that this is a press release concerning one of the research papers that was submitted to the United States Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health that we talked about yesterday?

A.  I believe it was.

Q.  Would you agree with me that this is an authentic copy of the March 5th, 1962, press release by The American Tobacco Company concerning the research, their research that, quote, heavy smoking group shows longer than average life span.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then below that it says J. B. Blalock with a date, October 20th, 1966.  And at the top of the page it says confidential.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And confidential means it's hot to be disclosed outside of the company; correct?

A.  It's obviously a confidential communication to the attorney.

Q.  Okay.  And the attorney is Mr. Yeaman; correct?

A.  Yes.

	1
	Q.  Let's look at the quotes that are contained
	
	


	2
	on this document.  If we look at page 1 of the
	
	


	3
	exhibit, RJR-871, it says, quote, The concept that
	
	


	4
	cigarette smoking is the cause of the increase in
	
	


	5
	lung cancer and emphysema is a colossal blunder.  A

	And they list the source of that as medical

	13

	16

that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q,     If we turn to page 3 of the document, it says, quote, What would happen if we suddenly abolished all cigarettes tomorrow?  I would predict that the cessation of all cigarette smoking would have no significant effect on our death rates from lung cancer, heart attacks, emphysema, and most other diseases allegedly caused by cigarette smoking.  At the present time there are no solid facts to incriminate tobacco as a factor in the rise of lung cancer, heart attacks, and emphysema.

And it says the source, medical testimony presented to House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Apri-May, 1969.

Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

0_.  Would you agree with me that as of November 24th, 1970, that these three quotes in this document called In Defense of Cigarettes state American Tobacco Company's position on smoking and health at that time?

A.  These documents appear to be quoting others' views related to smoking health and particularly causation.  Around this time frame,

1970, the company's position was that the causation hadn't been proven.

Q.  So you agree with me that in 1970 when American Tobacco Company published this document, or pamphlet, that these statements accurately reflect American Tobacco Company's view of smoking and health at that time; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think that they -.-' from a general statement, and lack of proof around causation, that they would somewhat align with the company's views of that period of time.

Q.  You would agree with me that by virtue of the fact that American Tobacco Company reprinted these quotes from other sources about smoking and health, that it agrees with these quotes on smoking and health contained in its own pamphlet In Defense of Cigarettes?

A.  I don't know, you know, what the whole intent behind why they put these out*  Presumably looking at these articles here, they were wanting to share with the recipient of these other views on smoking and health around not proven or some of the gaps in the science.

Q.  And you would agree with me that this

document is not a confidential document, RJR-871?

A.  It doesn't appear to have any labels around confidentiality.  I don't know if,it was actually printed and mailed out, or placed in any kind of magazine.

Q.  Okay.

A. Obviously I mean it says as advertised at the bottom, but it doesn't actually appear to state where it was placed.

Q.  You would agree with me that the document on its face states an intent to advertise these statements on behalf of The American Tobaoco Company; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It appears to be Some kind of -- I mean at the bottom it says as advertised in, but nothing there.  So it appears to be some kind of printing material that the company was planning to plaoe somewhere.

Q.  And when the company was planning to place it somewhere, it was for the public to read these statements concerning smoking and health; correct? A.  Again I don't know where � if they were placed somewhere or not, where were they placed, or were they fliers for specific individuals.  It's hard

to say.  But clearly whoever was going to be the recipient of these, they would see that this obviously has The American Tobacco Company name aligned, or printed on the same piece of paper.

Q.  You would agree with me that regardless of where it would have been printed or what publication it was printed in, that the intent was that American Tobacco Company would share these views from other sources and smoking and health with the public; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A,  Okay, the intent was to share these views with other individuals, but I don't know who would have seen this.  Whether it was shareholders, general public, consumers.  I'm not quite sure where it actually ended up.

Q.  Okay.  Let's skip over to Exhibit RJR-1134. And this should be a 14-page exhibit marketed RJR-1134.  On the first page it says, quote, Facts every tobacco man should remember.  And then at the very bottom of the first page it says reprinted with permission from the United States Tobacco Journal, October 27th, 1977.

Q.  Would you agree with me that this appears to be an authentic copy of a letter agreement between Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and British-American Tobacco Company dated 10th April, 1958?

A.  It appears to be to the best of my knowledge.

Q.  And if we look at page 1, to the first paragraph on page 1, it says, "Dear Sirs," and then it has a numbered paragraph 1 in parentheses.  "For some time we have been pooling the findings and experience resulting from our joint and separate research programs, and the costs have been shared on bases agreed informally between us from time to time.  As the research programs are now becoming more extensive and more costly, we think it advisable that the allocation and sharing of such costs be put on a more formal basis."

Did I read that paragraph correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And this goes back to some of your testimony earlier in the deposition about the fact that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and British-American Tobacco were doing joint research together; correct?

appear to be written by Mr. Ellis concerning a
	
meeting
	in London with Mr. -- with Dr,v Haselbach on

the 8th
	and 9th of November, 1961; correct?

A.
	I would have to take a quick read --

Q.
	Sure,

A.
	-- just to make sure.

Q.
	Sure.

A.
	It's been a while since I've seen this one.


	Okay, I've had a quick review of it.

Q.
	Directing your attention to page 1 of the

exhibit,
	, can you tell us who Dr. Haselbach was?  In

the heading it says, "Meeting in London with
	
Dr. Haselbach."  Who was Dr. Haselbach?
	
A.
	He was a biological researcher.

Q.
	Was he with British-American Tobacco

Company?
	
A.
	I don't believe he was with American --

with the
	British-American Tobacco Company.

Q.
	Did he do work in collaboration with the

British-
	�American Tobacco Company?

A.
	I believe so.

notes concerning a meeting in London with

Dr. Haselbach on the 8th and 9th of November, 1961,

dated 15th November, 1961?

A.  I mean it appears to be a meeting with Mr. Haselbach, but I'm not sure if it was totally Charles Ellis that was meeting with him.  Possibly, it's just � obviously wasn't signed by Charles Ellis.  It's hard to say definitively, but it appears to be a meeting with Dr. Haselbach, and it has Charles Ellis at the end of the document, but it's not his signature, but --

Q.  Would you agree that S6D in parentheses is an abbreviation for signed?

A.  Possibly, but it seems strange that it wasn't actually hand signed,

Q.  Do you have any basis to dispute the authenticity, that this would be an authentic copy of the document?

A.  I have nothing to dispute the authenticity of it.

Q.  Let's turn over to a new section of that same binder.  If you go over to Section Number 10. A.  Is that forward or backwards? Q.  Forward. A.  Forward?

A.  Okay, I see it.

Q.  And the first tab is going to say 3191.

Let's look at the first exhibit, RJR-3191. It's a two-page exhibit.  If we look on page 1 it has the date, April 29th, 1963.  Below that it says, "John M. Johnston,, Esquire, White and Case, 14 Wall Street, New York 5, New York."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then below that it says � let me --let's turn over to page 2.  It says "Sincerely," and it's signed, it looks like the letter Y.  And then below to the left it has the initials AY and MS.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Would you agree with me that at this period in time, that Addison Yeaman was a lawyer who would have been writing to John M. Johnston, who's also a lawyer, on page 1; that's who the letter is addressed to?

A.  Yes.

Would you agree with me that this letter that's been marked as RJR-3192 appears to be a letter written in response to the April 29th letter, April 29th, 1963, letter that we just looked at that was marked RJR-3191?

Q.  In that paragraph, there's a name Dr. Robert B. Griffith.  Do you know who Dr. Griffith was?

A.  Yes, he was a researcher, I believe at BAT.

Q.  British-American Tobacco?

A.  I believe so.

Q.  And did Dr. Griffith do research on a filter in collaboration with Brown & Williamson Tobacco and British-American Tobacco?

A.  Yes, I believe some collaboration on developing selective filtration technology.

Q.  And in some of the documents you reviewed yesterday there was a reference made to � in conjunction with HIPPO I and HIPPO II.  There was a reference made to the Griffith filter study.  Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Would this Dr. Griffith have been the one who that Griffith filter study was named after?

A.  Yes.

appears that Mr. Yeaman, together with Dr. Oriffith, prepared a draft submission to the United States Surgeon General that this lawyer at White and Case was reviewing for Brown 6 Williamson?

A.  It would appear that I guess Dr. Griffith

had prepared some documentation, and they were

talking about possibly submitting it to the Surgeon

General.

Q.  And would you agree with me that within the context of this letter, it appears that this attorney at White and Case named Jack reviewed the submission and was responding to Addison Yeaman with his � with his comments about the draft submission? A.  It appears that he was making some

suggestions in terms of potential edits to the

report, or the submission.

on Mary 14th, 1963?

A.  Yes, it appears to be to the best of my knowledge.

Q.  Let's look at the first sentence of the second paragraph.  It says, quote --

Strike that.  Let me go back and ask you this.  Does this appear to be the submission by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation to the United States Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health in 1963?

A.  It appears to be talking about submission of material, and in this case they're referring to the materials coming from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee as being a source of -- of material because of the sponsorship from Brown & Williamson for its research programs.

Q.  You would agree with me that in this particular case the submission of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation to the United States Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health consisted of referring the Surgeon General to the research already being conducted by the TIRC; correct?

A.  That was obviously part of this letter, but they also talk about further in the document that we

have contributed materially to the development of cigarette filtering materials and filters, and will be glad to discuss any of these areas of research and development work with the Committee.  So it appears that Brown & Williamson has made an offer to the Committee if there's any other areas you'd like to discuss, we'd be glad to discuss those.

Q.  And I believe you answered questions about this yesterday.  I don't want to be duplicative. But you would agree with me that at no point in time between 1963 and the year 2000 did Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation disclose the HXPPO X and HXPPO II studies that you were asked about previously.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Excuse me, objection to form.

A.  I'm not aware of disclosure.  I'm certainly aware of the technical issues with those studies.

Q. Setting aside the technical issues of the studies, the studies themselves, HIPPO I and HXPPO II, were not shared with the United States Surgeon General in this submission of May 14th, 1963, were they?

A.  No, they were not, because of technical issues with those studies.

Q.     And those were technical issues that you considered to be issues that Brown & Williamson felt were issues in the study; correct?

A.  They were reviewed by -- the Tobacco Research Council's experts reviewed those experimental studies, and there were a large number of technical issues with the way the studies were performed, and that the conclusions in those reports could not be substantiated by the data itself.

Q.  Would you agree with me that if Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation had chosen to submit the HIPPO I and HIPPO II studies to the United States Surgeon General in 1963, that it could have done so voluntarily and explained their position on the technical issues with the study to the Surgeon General?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  They could have possibly done that, but the company felt that they were such poor quality that they chose not to submit them.

Q.  TheHIPPO I and HIPPO II studies could have been disclosed to the United States Surgeon General at any time between 1963 and the year 2000; correct? A.  Could have been. Q.  Okay.  But Brown & Williamson Tobacco

Corporation chose not to do so; correct?

A.  I'm not aware of them disclosing it.

Q.  Let's look at next exhibit, 31 � RJR-3129. It is 10 pages long.  And on page 1 it says at the top of the page, "BAT/B&W Cost and Risk Pooling Agreement?"

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then on page 10, it says, dated 1969, "British-American Tobacco Company, Limited, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, R&D cost and risk pooling agreement."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Does this appear to be an authentic copy of another R&D cost and risk pooling agreement between British-American Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation from 1969?

A.  I'll just take a quick look.

Appears to be authentic to the best of my knowledge.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go back to -- go backwards in your binder a couple of exhibits to the tab 3118. This is going to be an exhibit marked RJR-3118.

A.  3118.

Q.  Do you have it in front of you?

A.  Yes.

Q,     If we look at the top of the page, the date is February 28th, 1966, and below that to the left is it's addressed to A. D. McCormick, Esquire, British-American Tobacco Company Limited, P. O. Box 462, 7 Millbank, London, SW1, England.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then, if we turn over to page 3 of the exhibit, and it says "Sincerely yours" at the end of the letter.  It doesn't have a Signature, but to the lower left corner it has the initials AY in capitals, followed by MS in lower case.  And below that it says "be:  Mr. Finch."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Would you agree with me that the initials AY would be Addison Yeaman?

A.  He did use the initials AY, so presumably in this case it represents Addison Yeaman.

Q.  Would you agree with me that this is an authentic copy of a letter from Addison Yeaman of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation to A. D. McCormick of British-American Tobacco Company dated February 28th, 1966?

knowledge.

Q.  Okay.  Let's look at the content of the letter.  Let's look to the third paragraph that begins with the phrase "First of all."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And we'll highlight on the screen for you. It says, quote, First of all, there is considerable interest, not to say --not to say concern, on this side as to the report Harrogate may make of its activities and progress at the end of its first three years.  I certainly have no intention of reviving the old argument which, parenthesis, oversimplified, end parenthesis, centers around Harrogate's emphasis on biologic activity of tar or smoke ingredients assayed by animal skin painting. We are troubled lest that approach be taken to concede a significant causal relation between the use of tobacco and cancer of the lung.  To reassure you, I have no intention of aggravating the question, but the difference existing, we would hope to be afforded the opportunity of consulting with the people on your side concerning the way Harrogate's work is presented, admittedly with the hope of slanting the report, end quote.

	Did I read that correctly?

2
	A.  Yes.

3
	Q.  Can you tell us first of all what Harrogate

4
	refers to?  What is Harrogate?

5
	A.  X believe Harrogate was a -- a research lab

6
	in the UK conducting tobacco research.  So a lot of

7
	biological type research was going on at the

8
	Harrogate research labs.

9
	Q.  And it appears that Mr. Yeaman is

10
	referencing research going on at Harrogate that

11
	involved skin painting with smoke condensate, the

12
	tar from smoke condensate; correct?

13
	A.  That's what it appears to be.

14
	Q.     And do you know whether this was a mouse

15
	study or a different type of animal study?

16
	A.  Urn, I believe they did a lot of work with

17
	mice, but X don't know if they looked at any other

18
	species of animal, but they did do work on mice.

19
	Q.  We know at a minimum that this Harrogate

20
	study involved the painting of tar or smoke

21
	ingredients on animal skin; correct?

22
	A.  Yes, they did conduct work along those

23
	lines.

	sentence of that paragraph, it appears that this

animal skin painting study had been going on at
				
Harrogate for approximately
			three years;
	correct?


	A.
	It appears that some activities
		had been

going
	on :
	for three years.  I
	don't recall
	the exact

date
	when
	the Harrogate labs
	were operational, but
	
here
	it's
	referring to activities for the
		last three

years
	Q.
	Okay.
	
	


	A.
	And those activities could be different
		
things, but --

Q.  The activities, the Harrogate activities that Mr. Yeaman references here with regard to animal skin painting studies could have gone back as far as February 1963; correct?

A.  Yes.  I mean I don't �as I said, I don't know when the lab exactly started up, but typically the skin painting studies, you know, take, you know, one or more years to actually run once you've got the lab set up and the study design reviewed and approved.  So I don't know the exact date when they actually did start their first study, or when the lab was first activated, but obviously they're talking here that there's been some kind of activity over the last three years.

Q.  And if we use the representation that it

had been going on for three years in this particular

document; would you agree with me that the Harrogate

animal studies could have been taking place in 1963?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  Again possibly, but I � I don't recall the

exact date when that facility was operational.

Q,  I'm not asking for an exact date, but would you agree with me that it's � based upon Mr. Yeaman's representations in this letter, that the Harrogate animal studies could have been taking place in 1963?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think it's remote, because in here it says the activities and progress at the end of its first three years.  So assuming that it's been open three years, I doubt they'd actually have� you know, it would have taken them some time to set the lab up to start running animal studies.  Possibly '63, but without checking I'm unable to give a more definitive answer.

Q.  If this Harrogate animal study did commence three years prior to this letter in February 1966, . it would have been commencing or starting during the time period that Brown 6 Williamson was preparing its submission to the US Surgeon General Advisory

Committee on Smoking and Health that preceded the 1964 Surgeon General's Report; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  As I say, I don't know when they first started the first example animal study at Harrogate. If it indeed was in '63, then that date is obviously before the Surgeon General's '64 report.

Q.  And if we look at the top of page 1 at the exhibit where it says says, quote, Private and confidential, that means that Mr. Yeaman's letter to Mr. McCormick on February 28th, 1966, concerning the Harrogate animal studies was not to be shared with the public; correct?

A.  Weil, again it was an internal -- appeared to be privileged conversation between attorneys, obviously talking about potential litigation defense. Q.  And this document was not shared with the United States Surgeon General at any point between February 28th, 1966, and the year 2000; correct? A.  This document here? Q.  Yes, sir. A.  I'm not aware.

Q.     Okay.  And you're not aware of any disclosure made to the United States Surgeon General in 1963 that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation

was working with British-American Tobacco Company on animal skin painting studies that were dommencing in '63.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm not sure what was submitted because Harrogate was, X believe, conducting research through a sponsorship from a number of tobacco companies, similar kinds of research to what -- the equipment the U.S. was doing in terms of industry group research.  So I'm not sure what was submitted in relation to the work going on at Harrogate.

Q.  We looked earlier at Exhibit RJR-3194, which was the May 14th, 1963, Brown & Williamson submission to the United States Surgeon General. A.  Can I just look at--- find that, please? Q.  Yeah, if you want to flip back it should be --

A.  3193?

Q.  3194,  We looked at it earlier.  Do you see any mention in that exhibit of Harrogate animal studies taking place with skin painting with tar?

tobacco smoke, so they were disclosing that there was obviously research going on.

Q.  But you would agree with me they're not specifically disclosing to the Surgeon General that they're conducting their own mouse skin painting through Harrogate in 1963.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Well, I don't know, if the Harrogate was specific to BAT.  I thought there were several companies involved in sponsoring that -- that work, but I'd have to check on that specifically.  But I think here this statement says that the company is conducting ongoing research, and if the Committee would like to discuss it they'd be glad to talk about it.

Q.  You would agree with me that if Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation had chosen to voluntarily disclose the Harrogate animal skin painting studies to the United States Surgeon General it could have done so.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Possibly, but I � as I say, I don't know what was published or � from that work and the timing of those publications.

any disclosure made of the Harrogate animal studies from � that are discussed in this letter of February 28th; 1966, to anyone between 1966 and the year 2000, other than internal company researchers? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.

MR. LATHAM:  Can we take a break pretty soon?

MR. ANDERSON:  I've got one mora question on this document and then we can take a break.

MR. LATHAM:  Okay. BY MR. ANDERSON:

Q.  If we look at the last sentence of paragraph 2 of RJR-3118, this is Mr. Yeaman's letter, it says, "To reassure you, I have no intention of agitating the question, but the difference existing, we would hope to be afforded the opportunity to consult with the people on your side, admittedly with the hope of slanting the report."

Did I read that correctly?

A.  I'm sorry, I last track of where you're reading from.

Q.  RJR-3118.  And it's the first page, page 1.

A.  Oh, you Were on the first page.

Q.  And it's the third paragraph.  And we've got it highlighted on the screen for you as well. It says, quote. To reassure you, I have no intention of agitating the question, but the difference existing, we would hope to be afforded the opportunity of consulting with the people on your

side concerning the way Harrogate's work is presented/ admittedly with the hope of slanting the report/ end quote.

Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the phrase "slanting the report," would you agree with xne that Mr. Yeaman was anticipating that a written report was going to be prepared by Harrogate concerning its findings in this animal skin painting study?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  I think � I guess they were expecting that there was going to be some report generated.

Q.  Okay.

A.  But again the question is what was actually done.  This was just a suggestion �

Q.  Okay.

A.  � in this letter.

Q.  And would you agree with me that the term "slanting the report" within the context of this letter by Mr. Yeaman means that he would be � he admittedly has the hope of slanting the report away from conceding a significant causal relationship between tobacco and cancer of the lung?

A.  I don't know.  I mean there could be many interpretations of "slanting the report."  Obviously the paragraph appears that the � the attorney has some questions about the type of work that's going on and the reports from it, and making some suggestions about possibly talking with the folks involved in this work, but I don't know to the true extent of what he meant by "slanting the report" here.

Q.  Would you agree withine that Mr. Yeaman, writing on behalf of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, is troubled by the approaoh being taken by Harrogate that � to have conceded a significant causal relation between the use of tobacco and cancer of the lung?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form, A.  I think from a -*-> appears from his standpoint, he's an attorney, obviously thinking about possible litigation defense and what might be going on, has some questions about what the findings

might be from these studies.

Q.  And he's concerned that the findings might be that there's a significant causal relation between the use of tobacco and cancer of the lung; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  He has some concerns, you know, as he stipulates in this letter.

Q.  And you would agree with me that Mr. Yeaman is admitting that he has the hope of slanting the report away from this concession that there's a significant causal relationship between tobacco and cancer of the lung; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form; repetitive.

A.  It appears that he's --he's hoping to have some opportunity to talk to the individuals and, however he defines the term, slanting the report. But at the end of the day we did look at actually what the actions were, and what were the reports that came out of this research, because people could make suggestions all day long, or talk about things, but at the end of the day what actually happened?

MR. ANDERSON:  This is a good time to take a break.

Q.  Dr. Cook, my name is Norwood Wilner.  I don't think we've met, have we?

A.  I don't believe so.

Q.  And you're --� let me just get a couple of the basics down with you.  As I understand it you're presently employed by the RJR Reynolds Tobacco Company; right?

A.  Yes.

Cj.  And we're here in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is the place where the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is based; right?

A.  Yes.

Cj. In fact I've seen the old plant down the street where they used to make cigarettes here in Winston-Salem,   right?

A.     They had a number of different facilities around the  city.

Q. And they actually made the product here, right?

A.     I believe in  �  in some of  the facilities downtown,  yes.

Q.  When you were -- when you --have they made it since you came here?  Have they made cigarettes here in Winston-Salem since you arrived in Winston-Salem?

A.  We manufactured some product actually in Winston close to the R&D facilities,. and then we have a large facility in Tobacgoville just north of the city.

Q.  That's a place? A.  Yes.

Q.  And you said product, you mean cigarettes? A.  Yes.

A,  I'm in the R&D department for R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.  And when did you give your first legal --let's call this a legal kind of a conversation, or a deposition?

A.  My first deposition, I don't know, it was like '05 or '06 time frame.

Q.  Was it after you joined Reynolds, or was it after -- I should say was it after Brown & Williamson bought -- I'm sorry, Reynolds bought Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  It was after the merger between R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson.

Q.  So you had not given any legal depositions while you were an employee of Brown & Williamson. A.  No.

Q.  And you had not given any legal depositions while you were an employee of American Tobacco Company; true?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So what did Reynolds do to get you ready to give legal depositions?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Basically because I'd actually worked at American and Brown & Williamson I had a lot of experience and knowledge of those organizations, and so obviously that was important, to have somebody who's actually worked there and actually has a working knowledge of the various research activities and some of the individuals at those companies.  So that was obviously a factor.  In fact I volunteered

A.  Yes, it was a voluntary -- a volunteer activity to be a witness for the company.

Q.     So somebody sent out a memorandum saying who wants to volunteer to be a witness for the company and you said X do?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  No, it was a discussion with my -- with management, and legal counsel and the company.

Q.  I think we learned � do you know who Dr. Figlar is? A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you talk to him on a regular basis? A.  Yes, because he is head of product development.

Q.  Dr. Figlar testified that there were no doctors/ no medical doctors on staff.  Is that still true?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  So when you --when you say you're --you � you have people on staff with scientific training, you don't have people on staff with medical training; is that right?

A.  We don't have individuals with an actual MD degree; you know, a practicing -- a practicing physician within R&D.We do utilize medical experts. Often when we do clinical studies we contract with clinical research organizations, contract research organizations who have expertise, trained physicians. Q,     Clinical studies?.

9

20

	A.  There was work done looking at smoking

	habit.

3
	Q.  That's all?

4
	MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.

5
	A.  There was a variety of studies done looking

�
 6
	at for example there was some animal work done which

7
	we talked about earlier in this deposition.  There

8
	was a lot of technical issues with that work.

9
	Q.  Well, let me see if I can clarify this.

10
	You said Reynolds now does not do research on

11
	nicotine addiction.  Did I hear you right?

12
	A.  Yes.

13
	Q.  Okay.  So it would follow from that that

14
	Reynolds does not now do research on how to make a

15
	less addictive cigarette; true?

16
	A.  Our focus is on reducing harm in terms of

17
	toxic exposure and migrating smokers to new forms of

18
	tobacco, such as smokeless tobacco, for example.

19
	Q.  That wasn't my question.  I appreciate your

20
	answer, but I asked you is it true or not that

21
	Reynolds does not do research on how to make a less

22
	addictive cigarette.

23
	A.  I would say that the whole area of

24
	addiction, the focus was on toxicant reduction, risk

	reduction historically, prior to '88.  After the

change in definition, looking back retrospectively, some external folks believed that changing the nicotine levels would address some of the questions of addiction.  So historically, if you look back in time, the company has looked at or has actually reduced the levels of nicotine over time in its products.

Q.     Well, let me see if I can be more clear. Does Reynolds today � and I'll also ask you about Brown & Williamson and American in the past.  Does Reynolds today conduct research with the intent of discovering or inventing a way to make its cigarettes less addictive?

A.  The focus, as I said before, was on migration, and then under Reynolds American there is a company called Niconovum, which is focused on smoking cessation therapy.

Q.  Well, I didn't ask you about smoking cessation therapy.  I asked you about making a less addictive cigarette.  Do you know what I mean by that?

MR.   LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Yes, but I don't know how that you would actually make it less addictive.

Q.  Well, all right.  That's an answer, but

first let's see, is it true that Reynolds now, and Brown & Williamson and American before now, have never had research that was directed at making a less addictive cigarette?  Yes or no.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Relative to time, as I say, historically smoking has been classified as a habit, and it wasn't until the change in the definition in '88 that smoking got classified as addictive.  But looking to guidance from the external scientific community, some folks have looked at lowering nicotine, and we have looked at changes of nicotine levels in the product to see what effect that has.

Q.  All right, let's start with today and we'll work backward.  Today does Reynolds have a research project with the intent of making a less addictive cigarette?  Can you answer that question? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  To the best of my knowledge, I don't believe we do.

Q.  Your answer is no, you don't.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  All right.  Then is that true; did 1 get a no from that answer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  No, in terms of looking at ways to change the cigarette to reduce its addiotiveness.

Q.  Okay.  So same question as to Brown & Williamson.  As of the day that Reynolds acquired or merged with Brown & Williamson, did Brown & Williamson have an ongoing research project designed to discover or invent a less addictive cigarette?

A.  I'm not aware of an ongoing program.

Cj.  Okay.  And same for American.  On the day that Brown & Williamson bought or acquired or merged with American, same question.

A.  I'm not aware of an ongoing program.

Q.  Okay.  Now, are you familiar in general with the reports of the Surgeon General of the United States on the health consequences of smoking?

A.  Yes.  Depends upon which ones.  It may have been some time since I've read them.

Q.     Do you -- does -- do you have a library where these research papers and government publications are kept?

A.  Yes, we have a library at R&D where we have things such as the Surgeon General's reports, for example.

Q.     How many Surgeon General's reports have come out on the issue of smoking and disease since

BY MR. WILNER:

Oj.  Qkay.  I handed you a section of the 2010 Surgeon General Report on Nicotine Addiction, and asked you to have a look at it.  You've had time, haven't you?

A.  I've briefly scanned it, yes. Q.     But you're familiar with this kind of stuff, right?  Surgeon General writes about smoking and disease from time to time, and that's something you need to know about, isn't it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  We certainly pay attention to the Surgeon General's reports, and, as appropriate, helps to provide some direction for our research programs.

Q.     Who do you think knows more about smoking and disease, the tobacco company you work for, or the Surgeon General of the United States? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think the -- obviously the Surgeon General has a lot of resources in terms of the public health community.  We also contribute to the scientific knowledge around smoking and health as a company, and we look at external work, as well as what the Surgeon General does in terms of the reports that are pulled together.

	Q.  I guess I didn't ask my question very

2
	clearly.  I'll try again.  Who knows more about

3
	tobacco, about cigarettes and the diseases they

4
	cause, the tobacco companies, or the Surgeon General

5
	of the United States?

6
	MR. LATHAM:  Object to form.  Well beyond

7
	the scope of the notice.

8
	A.  I think it depends upon the specific area.

9
	Q.  All right.

10
	A.  You know, in terms of what areas the areas

11
	are focused on the Surgeon General and what is the

12
	science and what is knowledge base associated with

13
	those particular areas.

14
	Q.  Good enough.  How about as to the area of

15
	nicotine addiction, who knows more, the tobacco

16
	companies or the Surgeon General of the United

17
	States?

18
	MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form of the

19
	question; beyond the scope.  Dr. Cook is a

20
	representative of Brown & Williamson and American

21
	Tobacco, and he can't speak on behalf of those other

22
	companies as a witness in this deposition.  You may

23
	ask the question again.

24
	Q.  Okay.

25
	A.  Could you repeat the question one more

time?

Q.  She can read it back.

In the interest of time I'll go ahead, if we can get back on the record, ma'am, not to belabor the read back, I will consent to repeat my question. In the area of nicotine addiction, sir, who do you think knows more, the tobacco companies you work for, or the Surgeon General of the United States?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Same objection.

A.  I think if you're talking about the present time, obviously the Surgeon General has a lot of resources to bear on this topic, so probably in certain areas, that the Surgeon General may know more about certain areas of addiction, and there may be other areas where the company may know more.

Q.  Okay.  Well, what areas of addiction do you say the tobacco companies that you work for know more than the Surgeon General of the United States?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Same objection.

A.  Well, I mean obviously we have a lot of knowledge around the products themselves.  How people are using those products.  The chemistry.

	Q.  Okay.  So you -- you have just told me that
	


	2
	the tobacco companies you work for have more
	


	3
	knowledge about cigarettes, how they're designed.
	


	4
	and how they cause addiction, than the public --
	


	5
	than the public health authorities?
	


	6
	A.  I didn't say how they caused addiction.  I
	


	7
	said that we have a lot of knowledge and we do share
	


	8
	that knowledge in some of the publications and
	


	9
	externally, but we have -- you know, we do conduct
	


	10
	smoking behavior studies with our products to
	


	11
	understand how they're used, what levels of potential
	


	12
	exposure they're getting to intoxicants such as
	

�
	13
	nicotine.
	


	14
	Q.  Well, let me direct your attention to a
	

.
	15
	specific -- some specific statements made in the
	


	16
	2010 Surgeon General report.  So I'11 direct your
	


	17
	attention first to page 105.  Under the heading of
	


	18
	Introduction, it says, "Nicotine addiction is the
	


	19
	fundamental reason that individuals persist in using
	


	20
	tobacco products."  And then there's a comma.  And
	


	21
	it says, "And this persistent tobacco use
	


	22
	contributes to many diseases described in this
	


	23
	report."  Did you see that?
	


	24
	MR. LATHAM;  I'm going to object to the
	


	25
	form of the question.  It's repetitive.  The

identical question was asked of Dr. Figlar in this deposition.

MR. WILNER:  Okay.

MR. LATHAM:  And if you're going to persist, I'm going to keep making the same objection every time you do that.

MR, WILNER:  You're fair to protect the record, counselor, and we have no --no personal disagreements. BY MR. WILNER:

Q.  Sir, did you�-- did I read the statement from the Surgeon General correctly? A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And so as you sit here today, as a --as a scientist employed by the tobacco company, do you agree or disagree with that statement?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.  It's beyond the scope, repetitive.

A.  I agree in the sense that nicotine does play a role, and it's an important role.  But in terms of how people use product, the nicotine isn't the whole story in terms of why people choose to smoke.  There's other kind of sensory factors, the whole ritual of smoking, et cetera.  There are other reasons that go into the complex experience of

smoking a cigarette.  Nicotine also is an important part of that experience, but it's not the only reason that people choose to continue using cigarettes. Q.  Well, I'm sorry it wasn't clear, but I didn't see it written anywhere in the Surgeon General report that says it's the only reason.  It says it's the fundamental reason.  So with that clarification � I don't know if it's needed; it's written there -- do you agree or disagree with exactly what's written, the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Same objection; asked and answered.

A.  Sir, I believe it is an important reason, but not the only reason that people� Q.  Is it --go ahead, finish. A.  -- that people continue to use tobacco products.

Q.  Is it the fundamental reason; can you answer the question?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  The way this reads it sounds like this is the only reason that people use tobaoco products, and there are other reasons that people choose to use tobacco products besides just the nicotine itself.

Q.  Well, do you know what the word fundamental means?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Basis, the fundamental basis essentially. Q.  You know what the word means in the English language/ fundamental? A.  Yeah.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  So if you know what it means, can you answer whether or not you agree or disagree that it's the fundamental reason?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Not the only reason, but the fundamental reason.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; asked and answered.

A.  As I said, to me nicotine is an important part, or an important reason, but it's not the only factor that goes into why people continue to use cigarettes.

Q.  All right, one last try.  Can you answer the question yes or no, is it the fundamental reason? And if you can't answer the question, just tell me you can't answer, or won't answer. MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  It's� it's a complex situation.  I don't believe that nicotine is the fundamental reason.  Nicotine is an important part of it, but there are other factors that come into play, associated with the whole ritual of smoking and the interaction of the consumer with the product.

Q.  Well, if nicotine is not the fundamental reason, what is the fundamental reason?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form; asked and answered.

A.  I said it's more than just nicotine.  There are other things that drive it in terms of the whole interaction with the product.

Q.  That isn't what I asked you.  If you can't answer, tell me you just can't answer.  You said nicotine's not the fundamental reason.  You disagree with the Surgeon General.  Okay, then what is the fundamental reason?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; asked and answered.

Q.  Fundamental reason.  There are other answers.  Fundamental reason,

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It's very complex.  It's hard to say what is the one thing that's driving addiction.  It's a

Q.  What -- go ahead, finish your answer.

A.  � and nicotine plays an important part of that, but it's not the only reason.

Q.  What's the most important reason?

A.  Well, as I said, you know, nicotine is part of it.  It's part of one Of the important reasons. The other parts could be � it's going to be individual to the consumer.  It's the ritual, the taste, the aroma, the impact of the smoke in the mouth.

Q.  The ritual, the taste, and the aroma; is that what you said?

A.  Some examples.

Q.  So a product without nicotine that had ritual taste and aroma would sell just as well as a product with nicotine; is that your claim today? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  Wo, that's not my claim.  I said that nicotine is part of the experience, but you have other factors that go alongside that.

Q.  Without nicotine, does a cigarette sell?

A.  A cigarette with very low levels of nicotine has very poor consumer acceptability,

because the whole balance of taste is totally perturbed.

Q.  And your claim today, sitting here and representing the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company historically, and the American Tobacco Company, is that the reason that low levels of nicotine don't sell cigarettes is because of the taste. MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  That is one of the reasons, is the -- is the consumer acceptability, and part of that is the taste of the product.

Q.  And is that the fundamental reason, according to you today sitting here?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  As I said before, it's complex.  Part of it is because of the low levels of nicotine, part of it is the whole change in the taste characteristics of the product.

Q.  You done, or are you just going to';-- I didn't want to interrupt you. A.  No, that's it. Q.  That's it.  All right.

Okay, so let's go back to the same sentence after the comma.  You already disagreed with the first part, but let's see about the second part.

"And this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report."  So let's first start at the end of that sentence, the many diseases described in this report.

During your tenure at American Tobacco and during your review of the various documents at American and Drown & Williamson, did you become aware of the various diseases as described in the � now described in the 2010 report that are caused by cigarettes?

A.  I was aware of diseases, yes. Q.  So when they say the diseases described in this report, what do they mean?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  Well, generally the report will list the diseases which the Surgeon General believes are associated with smoking, so it could be things such as lung cancer, for example. Q.  For example? A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's something you said the Surgeon General believes, as opposed to what Brown & Williamson believes, or believed?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. Q.  Making a distinction there.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  The -- this is the view of the Surgeon General, and the committee that advises the Surgeon General, on what they believe or state is the case for the types of diseases that are associated with smoking.

Q.  And what are those?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I mean there's a whole list that's currently cited in the current Surgeon General's reports.

Q.  Well, surely that's something you know about it, isn't it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Well, I mean I don't have a photographic memory to remember every single disease that's listed in the report.

Q.  You mean there are so many diseases caused by cigarettes that you can't even remember what they are?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; argumentative.

A.  There are a number of diseases that are listed that the Surgeon General believes, based on the committee's review of the science, are associated

Q.
	Well, give me some of the most important

ones.
	


	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.
	Well, things such as for example we talked

about various lung diseases, lung cancer.
	
Q.
	Lung cancer.  Okay.

A.
	COPD, for example.

A.
	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for

example.
	

Q.
	And what is that?  What does that do?


	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.
	It's kind of an inflation of the lung --

inflammation of the lungs.  It impairs your ability
	
in terms
	of breathing.

Q.
	Wait, you said it's an inflammation of the

lungs?

restricti

obstructed?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm not a medical expert.  I mean COPD is a condition that impacts your breathing in some form. Q.  Impacts it how, helps it or hurts it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; compound. A.  Well, it's a disease state, so it does limit or hinder your breathing ability. Q.  Can it kill you?

A.  Again I'm not a medical expert on this.  I mean obviously there are different -- I believe there's different levels of COPD, but that's kind of getting out of my area of expertise.

Q.     Well, is there somebody who knows this that makes cigarettes at your company that knows whether COPD can kill you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  We're now repetitive.  Dr. Figlar was designated as the person most knowledgeable on health for R. J. Reynolds. You should restrict your questions to the topics for which this witness was designated. Q.  Goes to credibility.

Go ahead.  I mean you're pretty high up in the company, aren't you?

	A.  As I said, I mean it is a disease, it

15
	restricts your breathing, and there are different

	levels.  And with any kind of a disease there's

17

21
	it kills you?

22
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection.  That question is

VTDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the record, the time Is 12:06.

(Continuing after lunch recess. The witness is not present.)

VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're on the record.

Mr. Wilner, I tried to reach Judge Arnold's chambers.  I haven't heard back from his judicial assistant.  I would have copied you on my email, but I did copy Mr. Shields and Mr. Anderson.  And she wrote back that Judge Arnold is not available this afternoon to deal with the objections that are currently pending on the last series of two questions that you asked.

I think that the way you're conducting the deposition is argumentative and harassing of the witness, and I'd like to get the deposition done with questions and answers.  We haven't had any difficulty the past day and-a-half with the other plaintiffs' counsel having questions, and I do want to get the evidence completed.  So my suggestion is that we table the last two questions that you asked the witness, move on to a new subject so we can try to get as much as we can completed, and then we can, raise with the court the objections that I had to

the last two questions, and generally to the scope of the witness's designation for this deposition. And so that's my proposal for you to respond to, please.

MR. WILNER:  I'll just � I'm just going to ask questions, and the way I best can.  I have no argument with you.  And you know, let's just proceed.  I'm not going to change subjects just because we don't like the subject, but I'11 ask questions the best I can, and you can � your objection is duly noted.  I don't intend to have any colloquy about it or yell about it.  I think you behaved very professionally.  No problems with counsel.  So let's get the witness and let's get going.

MR. LATHAM:  Are you going to ask the identical question you just asked?

MR. WILNER:  I don't remember what it was. I'll do the best I can. .

At the -- let me ask it this way.  When you were employed, or with respect to Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco, and the knowledge of the -- of those companies that you bring to this deposition, is it the position of � of *-.- or was it the position at any time material of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, back --referring back to the first sentence of the Surgeon General's report, that the persistent tobacco --this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report?

Q.  The persistent � well, let's take the sentence apart since there seems to be some ~-something to do with that.

The entire sentence reads "Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products."

Now, before we go further, and to clarify,

	do you understand what the word persist means?

2
	A.  Yes.

3
	Q.  What does it mean in reference to the use

4
	of tobacco products?

5
	A.  In this case it means continue to use.

6
	Q.  Continue.  Okay.  Does it -- does it imply

7
	that they continue to use on a regular basis?

8
	A.  Well, continue to use tobacco at some

9
	frequency of use, depending upon the individual.

10
	Q.  Well, okay.  And when you say continue to

11
	Use, continued to use, continued after what?  What

12
	does continued mean?

13
	A.  That they choose to continue to use the

17
	A.  You're going back to the sentence --

	Q.  Yes.

19
	A.  Now this just says persistent tobacco use.

20

they may use it multiple times every day.

Q.     Has -- has the companies that you're representing here, have they studied how people use their product?

A.  In terms of looked at, studied in terms of cigarettes per day, for example? Q.  Um~hmm. A.  Yes.

Q.     So what's the most common number of cigarettes that people smoke?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Common number is typically less than 20 cigarettes per day.

Q.  Well, less than 20 isn't a number, is it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Less than 20 --Q.  What's the most common number? A.  I don't recall the specific number.  It could be 17 or 18.  I know it'sgenerally less than 20.

Q.  Well, less than 20, 17 or 18 is almost a pack a day, isn't it?

A.  Typically 20 cigarettes in a pack of cigarettes, so if you're using 16 or 17, that's, you know, a large portion of the pack of cigarettes.

Q.  How many packs -- how many packs of cigarettes in a carton? A.  Typically 10.

Q.  And how many cartons per week do people usually smoke?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Some people are typically smoking less than 20 cigarettes per day, so that would mean less than seven packs per week.

Q.  Well, I understand the less than, so again you said 17 to 18 cigarettes per day is the most common number of cigarettes consumed by people who are smoking your cigarettes; right?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I said that approximately.  I didn't recall the exact number.  I know that it's less than 20, but it could be 17 or 18.  I'm just saying it's not 20, it's less than 20.

Q.  How long does it take to smoke a cigarette? A.  Again it's up to the individual, but it can take, you know, several minutes.

Q.  Well, several minutes means what? Certainly the tobacco companies have studied the way people use their product; right?

A.  We've looked at smoking topography and there's a wide range in terms of how people smoke a cigarette.

Q.  And what's the average? A,  Average for what?

Q.  For the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. A.  Urn, I don't recall the exact number. Q.     What's the range?

A.  As I say, I don't have that number in my head right now.

Q.  Okay.  So individuals --nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist, or you say continue to use tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report.

Mow, does American Tobacco, did they agree with that statement?

A.  You talking about this whole sentence here? Q.  Well, I'm talking about the second part of it.  This persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report.

A.  In terms of the company at the time, American Tobacco, I mean obviously you're talking about language from a 2010 report relative to American Tobacco before it was acquired in late 1994.

You've got a big time difference here.  But the company in '94 recognized the association and the risks associated with smoking.  So in terms of continued use of product, there was an association and obviously a risk of disease from using a tobacco product.

Q.  Well, maybe I wasn't clear.  As -- what this sentence says and what I want to see if you can answer is whether American Tobacco or Brown & Williamson agreed that it was the persistent use that caused the diseases or contributed to the many diseases described in this report.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Well, Brown & Williamson, in the late '90s, did say that smoking is a cause of disease.  And obviously smoking, you have to use, you know, tobacco product for a length of time to be able to get a disease.  But Brown & Williamson's position in the late 1990's, early 2000, is that smoking is a cause of disease.

Q.  Smoking is a cause of disease.  Okay.  Hold on one second.

Is persistent tobacco use a cause of disease?

A.I think continued use of tobacco can result

in disease.  It depends upon ultimately the type of product used, the manner and frequency of use, and ultimately the indiyidual in terms.of their biological makeup, their biological stability, the lifestyle factors, et cetera.

Q.  And if nicotine addiction leads to persistent use, then does nicotine addiction contribute to many diseases described in the Surgeon General's report?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form; beyond the scope; repetitive.

A.  Nicotine itself is not considered to be a carcinogen.  And as I'd explained before, there are other factors that come into play in terms of addiction in the sense of smoking.

Q.  I guess my question wasn't very clear, then.  Let me see if I can ask it again.

to be carcinogenic, and there are other reasons that you have to look at in terms of an individual in terms of disease causation.  As I mentioned before, in terms of the product they're using and how they're using that product, how frequently they're using it, so it's -- it's a complex situation.  It's a complex answer to your question.  That's the best I can do.

Q.     Let me direct your attention to page 113 of this report under the section that's called pharmacokinetics.  Do you see that? A.  Yes.

Q.  Pharmacokinetics, do you see that? A.  Yes.

Q.  Are you familiar with this section? A.  It's been some time since I looked at it. Q.  Okay.  Well, with the knowledge that you've obtained from looking at the history of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, I'll ask you to agree or disagree with the statement from the Surgeon General of 2010.  "Nicotine addiction depends on the amount of nicotine delivered and the way in which it is delivered, which can either enhance or reduce its potential for abuse.  The faster the delivery, rate of absorption, and attainment of high concentrations of nicotine, the

greater is the potential for addiction." Do you agree with that? A.  Can I just read it one more time myself? Q.  Sure.

A.  Sure.  I agree in part with some of the statements here.  As a company we say that nicotine and tobacco products is addictive.  Certainly there is a wide range of pharmacokinetics involved depending on the type of product you use and how you use it.  So there are differences in the rate of delivery, absorption, et cetera.  But as I said before, nicotine is part of the role in terms of addiction, but it's not the only reason in terms of people continuing to use tobacco products.  As I mentioned before, there are other factors that come into play in terms of the ritual and other sensory aspects of using a tobacco product.

Q.  Well, let me see if I can take this apart and get your answer clearly.  First sentence, "Nicotine addiction depends on the amount of nicotine delivered and the way in which it is delivered,"  Do you agree with that?

A.  Um, not necessarily, because products deliver a wide range of nicotine concentrations, including nicotine replacement therapy products.  It

plays a role/ but there are other factors that come into play in the situation.

Q.  Well/ doesn't it say the way in which it is delivered?  Doesn't that mean that the way in which it's delivered in a cigarette is more effective than in a nicotine replacement product?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  It doesn't actually state that in this particular section here.

Q.  Well/ you know that to be the case, though. A.  I say it --�� I say I agree in part with this paragraph.  The nicotine plays a role in addiction. Obviously there is some interplay in some of the rate of absorption, but there are other factors that go into the continued use of a tobacco product, as I've elaborated earlier.

Q.  All right, to the extent that you or your -- the companies you represent here today agree that nicotine addiction depends on the amount of nicotine delivered, and the way in which it is delivered, then how does the design of the cigarette influence the amount of nicotine delivered and the way in which it is delivered?

A.  If you're asking me about in terms of the design of a cigarette, a cigarette contains nicotine

	as an inherent part of the plan.  And the smoke, when
	


	2
	they smoke a product, can draw different amounts of
	


	3
	smoke from the cigarette depending upon how they
	


	4
	smoke it.  And there's lots of things that go into
	


	5
	the design of a cigarette in terms of consumer
	


	6
	acceptability, in terms of the type of tobacco used,
	


	7
	the flavorings, the type of papers, filters.  So a
	


	8
	lot in terms of what the smoker would draw from a
	


	9
	product would depend upon a lot of those features in

	combination with one another.
	


	11
	We do see a wide range of nicotine yields

	from cigarettes.  Even an individual smoker can get
	

	13
	different amounts at different points in the day, so
	


	14
	there's a lot of variability in terms of how much
	


	15
	they get from a product.  Obviously the amount to

	begin with in the blend has some part in how much is
	


	17
	actually yielded in the smoke of the cigarette.

	Q.     Well, let me start then and take it apart.

	It says, "Nicotine addiction depends on the amount
	


	20
	of nicotine delivered, and the way in which it is
	


	21
	delivered."  Let's talk about the amount of nicotine
	


	22
	delivered.  Does cigarette design, as your companies

features, will yield different amounts of tar versus� you know, in terms of smoke components. And also different amounts of nicotine depending on the tar delivery.  So we have, for example, very low machine yielding cigarettes that deliver lower levels of nicotine, for example.  And then we also offer higher machine yielding smoke cigarettes that yield higher levels, for example, of nicotine in smoke.  So from a machine standpoint, there's a range of products with different amounts of tar, and, as a consequence, nicotine in smoke.  For example a 10th of a milligram of nicotine to higher levels of say, you know, one, two milligrams of nicotine.  And then in terms of how a smoker smokes those products they can get a range of tar and nicotine from those products, depending upon whether they take small puffs or large puffs can influence what they actually yield from the product,

consequence of the tar falling the nicotine yields of
	
the cigarettes have also fallen -- fell
	as well as a

consequence of that.
	

Q.  Do decisions .-- so your answer is yes,
	
decisions made by American Tobacco and
	Brown &

Williamson have influenced the amount of nicotine
	
delivered.
	

A.  Have influenced the amount of
	nicotine

yielded in the smoke of a cigarette, yes.
	
Q.  You were going to say yielded
	in -- as

tested by a machine?
	

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the
	form.

A.  We -- yes, by a machine.
	

Q.     Okay.  And have decisions made by Brown &
	
Williamson and American over the years
	affected the

way in which the nicotine is delivered?
	
A.  The nicotine is there; it's a
	natural part

of a tobacco plant.  It's delivered the
	way it's

always been delivered.  It comes through the smoke
	
from -- with smoke from the cigarette.
	

Q.  It comes through in the smoke
	of the

cigarette?
	

A.  It' s delivered the same way.
	It's part of

the combustion process of when you're puffing on a

into the smoke.

Q.  And what affects the rapidity or amount of the amount of nicotine that � excuse me, that transfers from the smoke to your blood? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  So now you're talking about actually absorption and uptake in the body? Q.     Yes.

A.  Um, well, that comes into, you know, your inhalation behavior, how much you're actually smoking.  But ultimately, when you inhale tobacco smoke, there's nicotine in that smoke, and it transfers fairly rapidly into the blood, and then throughout the body.

Q.  Let me direct your attention to page 114, bottom of the page on the right-hand column. Summarising above columns, it says, "Together these results demonstrate that the nicotine pharmaookinetics associated with cigarette smoking is likely to lead to high potential for addiction." MOw, does American and Brown & Williamson, the companies you represent here today, agree or disagree with that?

A.  I think � as I say, we said nicotine plays a role, so there's a potential, because of the rapid

rise, but as I said before, there are other factors that need to be taken into account when you * re discussing potential for addiction.

Q.  Well, I asked whether you agreed or disagreed.  Can you tell me?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. A.  Just read the statement one more time for myself.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I would say I would disagree with the way it's written there because there are other factors that need to be taken into account.

Q.     All right.  Does � did American Tobacco or Brown & Williamson have research that you can cite to me today that disagrees with the statement that I asked you about earlier that says, on page 105 --excuse me -� that nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't recall a specific document right now, but I know from experience that there are other factors that are involved in actually the reasons why

people continue to use a tobacco product. Q.  Well, let me �

A.  We know from research that when we look at products with different tar to nicotine ratios, that there's lots of factors that go into how people smoke those products.

Q.     Your colleague at Reynolds, Dr. Figlar, testified at trial at -- and I'll quote it for you. He said, "I don't know that addiction has anything to do with the public health consequences of smoking."

Now, I'd like you to tell me whether representing -- and that was --that was -- he � that was Dr. Figlar testifying on behalf of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as a representative of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  Now you're here today representing earlier tobacco companies that have been acquired by Reynolds.  So let me ask you if you agree or disagree based on the knowledge that those companies would have had at the time.  "I don't know that addiction has anything to do with the public health consequences of smoking." MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. A.  I think that it's a complex situation in the sense that it comes down to how people are using

the product, the type of product they're using, how are they using it, so addiction plays some role, but it's a complex situation.

Q.  It's a complex situation?  That's your answer?

A.  The role of addiction in terms of public health.  It depends upon the type of product you're talking about.  You know, whether it's a smokeless type product versus a combustible product. Q.  Done with that answer? A.  Yes.

Q.  Well, let me make sure that -- the context of all my questions is we're talking about cigarettes.  Not talking about some noncombustible product, talking about a cigarette.  Do you know what a cigarette is?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; it's argumentative. A.  Yes.

Q.  All right, tell us the definition of cigarette so we won't get off on that.

A.  It's tobacco rolled in paper, and intended to be lit and smoked.

Q.  And your company and the companies you represent manufacture cigarettes, right? Among

A.  Cigarettes are part of the product that we manufacture, yes.

Q.  And you intend people to buy and smoke these products, do you not?

A.  Consumers could choose to buy our products

Q.  All right.  Based on your understanding, then, I want � I want to see whether you agree or disagree, does addiction have public health consequences?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  In part, yes, depending upon what it is you're addicted to.

Brown & Williamson?

A.  Potentially, yes.

Q.  Potentially, yes.  What is it going to take to be yes?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; it's argumentative.

A.  As I said, it comes down to the individual. The type of product that they're using, how they're using it.  How frequently are they using it.  The particular biological makeup of the individual. Their lifestyle.  So that's why I say potentially, because it depends upon a lot of those factors.

Q.  Well, public health doesn't ask about the particular lifestyle of an individual.  Public health talks about how many people are dying, doesn't it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form.  It's argumentative, beyond the scope.

A.  Public health talk about a lot of different things besides just death.  As a company we say that nicotine and tobacco products is addictive.  And that's our position.  And I think you then have to look at the actual individual in terms of whether or not they're addicted, and also how are they using the product to determine ultimately what the risk is

going to be for that individual.

Q.  Well, how many people, then, if -- did American Tobacco study how many people were injured from its products?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  American Tobacco would have been aware of the public health research pertaining to, for example, potential deaths that have been allegedly associated with smoking, for example.

Q.  So -- all right.  How many people were injured in any given time period, according to public health authorities, by American Tobacco or anybody else's cigarette?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I don't .-�- I don't know that -- that number.

Q.  You said American Tobacco followed that number, did research, on that number?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I said American was aware of the literature, or the public health statements or data that was available related to smoking and health. Q.  They were aware of it.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection; form. Q.  And how do you know they were aware of it?

A.  Because the company followed the literature on smoking and health.

Q.     Followed it meaning it had it in the library?

A.  It would have been in the library or various reports that came out. Q.  Did anybody read it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There would have been relevant individuals in the company or outside experts would have reviewed that information.

Q.  And did the company disagree with it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Clearly any -- any death from tobacco use is very unfortunate, which is why the company diligently researched the ways to address the smoking and health situation through research.

Q.  Well, that wasn't what I asked.  I understand that statement.  But I asked you if American Tobacco didn't accept 400,000 deaths a year, how many deaths did they accept?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  As I said, the company was aware of information out there from the public health officials, and obviously any.-- any potential alleged association to smoking or something of concern, which is why the company invested in and conducted research at various points in time to investigate the smoking and health situation.

Q.     Do you accept, as you sit here today, that modern medicine, as expressed through the Surgeon General � the recent Surgeon General report I have given you, believes, understands, and has written clearly that nicotine addiction to cigarettes is a cause of disease?  Do you understand that now, or do you disagree with that now?

A.  I understand what they've written here, but as I said before, I don't agree with the way the statement is written.

Q.  Well, does -- do you agree that nicotine addiction is a cause of disease?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; repetitive; beyond the scope.

A.  No, because there are lots of things like NRTs which contain nicotine, and people don't get disease from using NRTs.  And nicotine by itself is not a carcinogen.

Q.  Well, I don't know what NRTs are. A.  Nicotine replacement therapy products. Q.     We've been �as I said before, the context of my questions is cigarettes unless --unless we say otherwise.  I'm not here talking about pills or anything else.

A.  Well, you were talking about .--

MR. LATHAM:  Doctor, let him answer questions.  Let's ask questions.

Q.  All right, nicotine addiction to cigarettes.  Do you agree or disagree it's a cause of disease?

A.  No, because it's complex.

Q,  So you don't agree it's a cause of disease. Just trying to pin you down.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; asked and answered.

A.  As I said, no, but there's reasons for that disagreement, and X don't agree with that statement entirely because there are other factors that need to be taken into account.

Q.     And during American Tobacco's existence, were you aware of anything written by American Tobacco that stated that nicotine addiction in cigarettes was a cause of disease?

A.  I don't recall specifically on that. Q.  And if American Tobacco never believed that nicotine addiction was a cause of disease, is that the reason that American Tobacco never researched how to make a less addictive cigarette? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Could you repeat that question again? Q.  If American Tobacco never believed that nicotine addiction was a cause of disease, was that the reason that American Tobacco never researched a less addictive cigarette?

A.  No, because the -- the term addiction for smoking didn't come about -- well, there was a change in the definition in 1988.  So the whole topic of addiction didn't come up until that point in time in terms of a definition change in 1988.  The company did � did conduct research on looking at different ratios of -- of tar to nicotine, and also implemented general reduction techniques to reduce the general levels of nicotine yielded in the smoke.

Q.  Are you saying that American Tobacco never knew that its products were addictive before 1988? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  The company's position that smoking was a habit prior to the '88 definition, and then ultimately, through the merger or acquisition by Brown & Williamson in the late 1990s, said that smoking was addictive.  The company was certainly aware of different viewpoints in the scientific literature particularly in, you know, different periods of time, particularly like the '60s time frame, early '60s, where there was a lot of confusion about the definition.

Q.  Are you done with your answer?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were shown a document in -- that

It's RJR-403.  And I believe you were questioned on this document before.  Do you remember?

A.  Do you have a paper copy of that?

MR. ANDERSON:  I'm finding it right now. Do you need a hard copy, Mr. Wilner? MR. WILNER:  No, I'm okay.  Just give me a second here. BY MR. WILNER:

Q.      I assume that you have had an opportunity, since you volunteered to be a witness and to defend the company, of going through the American Tobacco files into the documents that are archived there? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I mean live looked at a number of the American Tobacco historical documents.  Obviously I haven't looked at every single one because there's a substantial number of documents, historical documents.

Q.  And this document from 1941, when was the first time that you saw it?

A.  This particular one? Q.  That particular one.

Q.  It may have come up.  So you think you saw it first in a lawsuit, not in the company archives? A.  I don't recall exactly where I first saw this.  I mean there's so many documents.

Q.  Well, did you -- did you try to do some kind of a real systematic study of what was in the archives before volunteering to be a witness to defend the company?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There was a certain amount of research I had done when I first joined the company from South American Tobacco as part of my research efforts.  As part of the scientific process you actually research what had been done in the past, and part of that is to go through and look through some of the historical internal and external documents.  And so as part of that process I got exposed to a number of the

documents the company had in terms of the various research programs, or -- or later on there may have been a particular research question that came up to see what was done.  So there were some documents that in the course of my research work I looked at.  There are obviously some that come up as a result of litigation or questions in litigation.

Q.  But whatever research you did, you must have:missed this one, huh?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  As I say, I don't recall exactly where --where I first saw this particular document.

Q.     Well, when you went back to the archives of American Tobacco -- and these archives go back before 1941?

A.  I know there are �� there are documents that date way before 1941.

Q.  Okay.  And the � and these documents are kept in some location.  Has it been moved to Winston-Salem now, since the company was merged and bought but?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Well, I mean a lot of these old documents are kept electronically, so we would access them through electronic means.  And there will -- I know

we do have a document warehouse, and there's also the depository of documents that came out of the MSA settlement.

Q.  MSA settlement.  When was the first time then that these documents such as the one, the 1941 document in front of you, was available to the public?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  In terms of this specific document are you talking about; or are you talking about --Q.  Okay, let's talk about that one. A.  I don't know.  I mean I know a lot of the documents -- the document used in litigation ended up being placed on the -- in a public site in the late 1990s.

Q.  The late 1990s they were put on, you said, the site, like a website; is that what you mean? A.  Yes.

Q.  And before that they were not available to the public, were they?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  Urn, I don't know what documents were and weren't available prior to that time in terms of anybody in the public having access to these types of documents.

Q.  Well, you're not saying that if somebody walked into The American Tobacco Company in 1980 and said I want to see the archives, somebody from the outside, they'd be allowed to see it.  Are you saying that? A.  Wo.

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form; argumentative.

A.  Because a lot of these documents describe, you know, the research and development work that went on in the company;  A lot of documents would have proprietary information on them, trade secret information in terms of the design or types of materials or ingredients that we use, or the process that we use to make our products, so you've got a lot of proprietary information there, and you just don't open up your R6D facility or documents to anybody coming in from the street, to the public.

Q. Well, if you've done scientific research on whether cigarettes harm people, you'd certainly want to open that up to the public, wouldn't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; argumentative.

A.  Research work that was relevant and appropriate quality, et cetera, the company shared

that information.  You know, for example the work that was sponsored at the Medical College of Virginia.  There were over 200 publications that came out of that work related to smoking and health, for example.

Q.     Say what?  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  For example the R&D work that American sponsored at the Medical College of Virginia resulted in over 200 publications in terms of sharing that type of research publically.

Q.  All right.  My question is if -- if American Tobacco had done research that showed that cigarettes were dangerous, or that it was -- that affected the science of the health effects of cigarettes, would that research have been made public?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It would depend upon what the specific research is.  I mean it could be that it was already known outside and the company was repeating it, or following up on some suggestions.  I think you'd have to look at it on a case by case basis in terms of what information was published or shared outside the company.

Q.  Well, is there anything in this 1941 paper that's proprietary that you wouldn't want one of your competitors to see?

A.  This is 1941.  This is a long time ago. Q.  Yes, it is.

A.  I mean this is talking about the company's approach to biological research/ and ultimately talking about some of the work that's going on at the Medical College of Virginia.  And obviously that was something that was publicized in terms of the work at the Medical College of Virginia.  This is kind of an internal document, and just talking about the approach that they're taking with MCV.  I don't understand why at this point in time they would have made this public in terms of the document.

Q.     Well, wouldit hurt the perception of the Medical College if it were known that American Tobacco was trying to use the Medical College of Virginia to convince doctors that smoking was not harmful?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I mean this -- I mean I'd have to read the whole document again, because it's not as simple as that.  I mean the company was looking to collaborate on smoking health research with the Medical College

Q.  Now, in this document, it's referenced that this gentleman Larson, Paul Larson, is --is suggested as someone who would work at the Medical College of Virginia?

A.  Let me just --

Q.  I think it's� let me see if I can help you.  I don't have the page here.  It's page 3.  "As a result of discussions with Mr. Neeley, Dr. Haag" -- H-a-a-g -- "was asked nearly a year ago to look about for a man having the desired qualifications.  You have now recommended Dr. Larson, who is a young physiologist."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. A.  Both he and Dr. Haag were at the Medical College of Virginia.  I don't know in terms of their ultimate role in terms of ~~ when you say importance, they were important in terms of they published a lot of papers in the area of smoking and health, and compiled a lot of the external � you know, the external research that went on in this area. Q.  He was in charge of that department eventually, wasn't he?  Paul Larson?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I don't recall specifically in terms of what his ultimate title was.

Q.  He was the lead author in their book, right?  Tobacco, Larson, Silvette, and Haag? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  He was one of the authors on that book that summarized the world literature on smoking and health.

Q.     And on paragraph 4 it says, "Larson seems to be splendidly equipped for the position, yet we should not take him into our staff directly.  I asked Dr. Haag if some arrangements could be made whereby the Medical College might secure his services on the basis of a grant."  Do you see that?

A.  Okay.

Q.  "Secure his services on the basis of a grant."  You see that?

A.  Yeah, I see that statement. Q.  So that means that -- that behind the scenes; the tobacco company was paying the salary of this guy Larson, who was appearing to the public to be a scientist at the Medical College of Virginia. MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. Q.  Is that what it means?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  They were paying a grant to the Medical College, and then the Medical College could decide, you know, how they wanted to spend that money, and who they wanted to hire.  So ultimately the MCV had, you know, the final call on how that money was spent and what kind of staff they get in.

Q.Where are you getting that?  Not from this document.

A.  Because it's a grant.

A.  if some arrangements -- yes.  "If some arrangement could be made whereby the Medical College might secure his services on the basis of a grant." Q.  So his salary -- tell me if you have a single document in front of you, or anywhere, that you can refute that Paul Larson, who represented himself to the public to be a scientist at Medical College of Virginia, was not paid 100 percent by the tobacco company in secret.  You tell me if you can refute that.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; argumentative.

A.  I don't know what the ultimate arrangement was with this situation.  I know that there were many publications that came out with his name on that was peer reviewed by external peer reviewers, and the science stood up to the peer review process and was published in well-respected journals.

Q.  Now, in any of those journals, or in the book that he published with Harvey Haag, did he at any time reveal that 100 percent of his salary was being paid by the tobacco company?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form; lacks foundation.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection. Q.  They're supposed to disclose where the funding came from, aren't they?

A. Generally. It's not always done that way, but some researchers will disclose where the funding came from, generally as a courtesy so the sponsoring organization.

Q.     Do you understand the concept of conflict of interest? A.  Yes.

Q.  What is a conflict of interest to a scientist in terms of what you just mentioned, disclosing the people that have paid either his salary or for the grant?

A.  Basically a conflict of interest as to disclosing where there is potential -- you know, where you're say receiving money from a sponsor,   that disclosing that so that it's transparent, and that hopefully it will be unquestionable in terms of the information that you get as a result of that study and that funding to avoid� by disclosing it, to avoid the impression that you are doing the work in a

But just the fact that you don't disclose it doesn't mean to say that there's a conflict there, or that the work has been influenced in any way.

Q.     Well, you -- first, youvwould not contest for a minute that modern scientific ethics require full disclosure of where the money came from. MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. Q.  Right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form and the scope.

A.  I believe today that journals, for example, do require you to disclose, you know, where the funding is coming from, but I don't know if that's universally applied or not.

Q.  Now, if American Tobacco, as it appears in this paper, had set up an arrangement whereas under which Paul Larson was paid 100 percent by the tobacco company, in secret, for being a scientist supposedly with the Medical College of Virginia, do you feel that that represents a potential conflict

of interest for Mr. Larson if undisclosed in his publications?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  First of all I don't know, you know, in terms of what the ultimate arrangement was.  This was a proposal.  I don't know what the ultimate arrangement was, and how that was disclosed to the university.  And then, as far as publications that came out of his work, I'd have to look at the publications to see did they recognize the funding from American Tobacco for this type of work.

Q.  And if they didn't, does that give the appearance of impropriety to Mr. Larson's work? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  There's all kinds of things possible, but at the end of the day, as I said before, when research work is published in a peer reviewed journal, it is reviewed by independent experts in that field, and it's judged on its scientific merits. Q.  Well, let me ask you this.  If American Tobacoo didn't like what Paul Larson, who they had had an arrangement with to pay his salary, was saying, they could have just jerked this grant and he'd have been out of work; true?

A.  Again I don't know what the ultimate arrangement was.  This was a proposal.  The company funded 1 think research from the '30s through the '70s with Medical College of Virginia.  Obviously felt that it was a�a good relationship from both sides.  MCV got funding to conduct smoking health research, and American got the benefit of the learnings and knowledge from that work.  That's it. Q,     Well, I guess that's fine, but that wasn't my question.  My question is American Tobacco could have, with one decision, one stroke of the pen, terminated Dr. Larson by ending his grant.  You don't have anything that contradicts that, do you? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  As I say, I don't know ultimately what the relationship was at the end of the day in terms of did the grant end up paying his salary, or was there grant money or money from the university that was coming in and then paying all or part of the salary or for that particular department itself.  I don't have, you know, enough facts before me to address the specifics of this statement here.

Q.  Well, let me ask you this way.  Assuming that American Tobacco could have terminated the grant that they said was an arrangement with the

the other.  Certainly they got funding from the company, and that would fund a lot of smoking health research which got published in scientific journals. Q.  How many did American Tobacco pay Harvey Haag?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection. A.  I don't recall the specific funding that was provided to the Medical College of Virginia. There were various annual reports that came out in terms of the type of work that was done and the funding associated with that.

Q,     Now, Harvey Haag, you know, went on to influence the American Medical Association not to pass any resolution against tobacco, and would report back periodically to American Tobacco on that issue.  Do you know that?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't recall that specifically.  I do know that the -- that the publication that came out in '61, the Lawson/Haag publication was actually used by the Surgeon General, was cited by the Surgeon General in terms of providing valuable information related to smoking and health.

Q.  Well, that wasn't my question at all.  I'll get to that in a minute.  But let's focus on one

MR. LATHAM:  Object to form. A.  Yes, it was,

Q. Harvey Haag was paid by grant money just like Paul Larson by the American Tobacco Company. You can't deny that, can you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  As I say, no, he was provided �he was provided with funding from American Tobacco Company. Q.

Yes or no; can you refute that or not?

A.  As I say, I know on a number of publications they cited support from American Tobacco.  I -- I don't know the specifics of the meeting you're talking about, so it's hard for me to answer that question.

Q.  Well, I'll ask you this Way then.  Would it be the wrong thing to do for a scientist supposedly at Medical College of Virginia to go to the American Medical Association and influence that association with his standing as a scientist, not to take a position against tobacco and never reveal that his salary was being paid by the tobacco companies? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q,  Is that an ethical thing to do; that's my question.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form; beyond the scope.

A.  You're making a lot of statements about his salary being paid, et cetera.  I don't know what the actual arrangement was at that time.  And he -- you know, or whether he was going to that meeting on his own accord and this is his personal belief, and based on the science at the time that's what he thought, or whether he was conveying some views from American

Q.  Okay, Dr. Cook, remember before we broke I was asking you about whether it would be ethical for a doctor to be by the tobacco companies and to go in and try to influence the AMA without revealing that. Remember I was asking you that?

A.  I know you were asking questions along those lines, yes.

Q.  Let me show you a document which I only have in electronic form, and which is a single page document being projected now.  it's on your screen, sir.

Q.  This document was not permitted to be seen by the public; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It obviously had some limited circulation in the company.  That's why it's stamped confidential.

Q.  So not even everybody in the company was allowed to see it.

MR. LATHAM:  Object to form. A.  I don't know who was on the list to see it, but obviously confidential means there was some restriction on the information.

Q.  And the public certainly would not be allowed to see it, would they?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It was an internal company document, so I don't believe the public would have seen it.

Q.  Well, it doesn't have anything to do with how you make a cigarette or what brands or any kind of formulation, does it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection. A.  It doesn't talk about product design. Q.  Has to do with what went on behind the scenes when this Dr. Haag tried to influence the American Medical Association; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Again I don't know why they stamped this confidential.

Q.  Have you looked through this document? A.  I just read it briefly. Q_.  Do you find the conduct of Dr. Haag in this� in this document and the conduct of American Tobacco Company to be ethical as described here?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It appears to me looking at it that Dr. Haog was having some discussions with the AMA about their positions.  So he was a stakeholder involved in some of the discussions with the American Medical Association.

Q.  A stakeholder?  That's what you called him? A.  Well, and mostly everybody has a � a role or to play in all of these discussions, and he was a medical researcher at the American Medical Association, so he was one of many stakeholders at that medical association.

Q.  And his stake holding was that -- was to defend the American Tobacco Company without telling anybody; right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It doesn't -- I don't recall seeing anywhere in here where it says that, you know, where he was receiving his funding from.

Q.  All right.  Well, let's go through it. It says, "Dr. Haag informed the undersigned," who was an American Tobacco executive, right?  The undesigned; right? A.  Yes.

Q.  "In a telephone conversation today that a proposal was made to the American Medical Association that it formulate a national policy on the smoking and health problem.  See attached correspondence, copies of which Dr. Haag sent over for our -- for our perusal in a personal communication to me.  The material has not been logged.  "

Well, let's take that apart.  First of all Dr. Haag, who is --when he goes to the American Medical Association, is posing as a scientist from the Medical College of Virginia, is making a personal conversation to the American Tobacco Company, reporting on what's going on in these meetings.  Do you understand that to be the case?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Well, it appears that he's having a conversation with Mr. Harlow about his meetings at the AMA.

Q.  Well, why would a -- a scientist who's supposedly with the Medical College of Virginia, who is posing as an independent scientist, make a personal communication to the tobacco company to report on what he's doing with the AMA?

	argumentative.

2
	A.  It just says that he was having a

3
	conversation with American reporting on the meeting.

4
	It could be --as I say, I don't know exactly what --

5
	what prompted this.  It could be that he just wanted

6
	to inform American on the nature of the discussions

7
	and what was going on.

8
	Q.  Well/ why should American Tobacco, the

9
	tobacco company, have any inside knowledge about

10
	what's going on between doctors in their conferences

11
	in the American Medical Association?

12
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

13
	A.  Could you repeat that question?

14
	Q.  Well, yeah.  But why should American

15
	Medical � why should The American Tobacco Company

16
	have any privileged information about what's going

21
	of these discussions that were being had with

22
	Mr. Haag.

23

Now, what does that mean to you? A.  I'm not quite sure what it means.  I mean it could mean that maybe it hasn't been filed yet, or -- I'm not quite sure what it means at this point. Q.  Well, if a -- if one of the executives from the American Tobacco Company gets personal information, a personal correspondence from a. physician or a scientist who's supposedly an independent scientist, and then says, well, I haven't logged it, what does that mean? MR. LATHAM;  Objection to form. Q.  Do you hot understand what that means?  Let me ask it this way.

A.  I mean it just says that it wasn't logged, and I'm not quite sure what he meant by that statement, hasn't been logged.  You know, hasn't been logged at this point in time, that maybe it was logged later.  I'm not quite sure what that means.

Q.  Well, you're not quite sure what it means, but in context, doesn't he use the word personal communication from Dr. Haag?

A.  He does say a personal communication. That's what it states in this letter.  Memo.

Q.  All right, let me ask it this way.  If it's true, since you say you don't know, if it's true that it wasn't logged because Mr. Harlow felt that he didn't want to keep a record of it, that he wanted to keep it a secret, would that not be improper as the -- as an official with the American Tobacco Company to be hiding and not logging materials sent to you from a scientist? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Why would it be hiding?  I mean there's this evidence that you've got a memo here that's talking about what's going on.  So if the intent was to hide something, why would you actually write it in a memo to say that you're going to hide it?  I mean this -- this document talks about what happened. Q.  And the document's marked secret, confidential.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; repetitive. A.  As I say, confidential, it was there with some restrictions in terms of who could see it.  I don't know who was on the distribution list for this document.  It was maintained in the company's files and obviously has been produced in litigation, so

this is in black and white in terms of what was happening here.

Q,     Dr. Cook, there is no distribution list on this document, is there?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There's two people at the top up there. Q.  Well, we've talked about those, and you said you don't know who's on the distribution list. But that's the distribution list, you know.

A.  But it could have been passed on to some other individuals.

Q.  You said I don't knowwho's on the distribution list.  Did you say that to me?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Mr. Wilner, there's no reason to yell at the doctor. Q.  I'm not yelling.  This is my normal tone of voice.

Go ahead. A.  As I said, I know there ere two individuals on the "to" list on this document.  I don't know what other distribution it may or may not have had besides those two individuals.

Q.  Okay, but you said I don't know who's on the distribution list, and there is no distribution list except these two people*  Just trying to pin

you down.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  So you were wrong when you said there was no distribution list.

A.  Perhaps I wasn't cleat.  The way the memo is written there are two names in the "to" field. What I'm saying is I don't know if this document, besides those two people, was shared more broadly or not.

Q.  And when you went to look at the archives of the American Tobacco Company, you didn't even get to see this evidently; right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't recall seeing this document until -- this is the first time I've seen it, I believe.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go on to the second paragraph. "The boards of trustees of the AMA were desirous that the council express an opinion by resolution so that the board which was also in session could take formal and immediate action."

Now, they were talking about a resolution about cigarettes and disease; right?

A.  It was obviously related.  Some statement related to smoking causes lung cancer or heart

	Q.  Okay.  So the AMA, the board of trustees of

3
	the AMA were of --. were desirous that the council of

4
	the AMA express an opinion by a resolution on the

5
	subject of cigarettes and disease; right?  Haven't

6
	we translated that right?

7
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

8
	A.  They were to have a resolution to make a

	statement on these diseases.

10

13

14

15
	pretty important organisation, wasn't it?

16
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; beyond the scope.

A.  X don't know what impact it would have had one way or the other.  There were certainly lots of publications out there on both sides in terms of causing or lack of evidence, so X don't know in terms of the American Medical Association's statements at this time what impact it would have had, because there was already a lot of information out there already in the public domain.

Q.  Well, you're not really qualified, as I understood it, to make an opinion on how a given resolution might have affected public opinion; correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection. Q.  That's not your field.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think it's very hard -- I mean looking back, you know, to the '60s from today, it's hard to really say what impact it would have had.

Q.     Well, I'll accept that you're not an expert if that's what you're telling me.  Xs that what you're telling me?

A.  X mean X lack sufficient knowledge in terms of AMA functioning.

Q.  Fine.  All right, let's go on � well, I wasn't talking about AMA functioning, but let's go on.  So the board of trustees were desirous that the council express an opinion.  Dr. Haag, after revealing that he and his associates had reviewed thousands of articles on the subject, stated that they still felt that there was insufficient evidence to support a statement that smoking causes lung cancer or heart disease.  Goodman and Seevers expressed the same view.  All right, let's start with Dr. Haag, okay? You'll see that he revealed that he and his associates had reviewed thousands of articles on the subject.  See where he says that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now, does this piece show in any way, shape, or form that Dr. Haag also revealed, to use the same word, revealed that he was being paid by the cigarette companies?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  It doesn't say whether he did or didn't.  I mean the way this document is written it doesn't say -- say either way.

Q.  Well, it says he revealed that he had reviewed thousands of articles, so he's revealed something.  Does it have anything in there that he

revealed who was paying him?

MR. LATHAM:; Objection to form; repetitive. Asked and answered.

A.  I don't see that particular statement, but many of the publications that he authored would have had reference to funding from the American Tobacco Company.

Q.  Well, that's :� are you now saying to me from that statement you just made that Dr. Haag ever publically revealed that his salary was being paid by the American Tobacco Company?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Is that what you're saying now? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm saying that there would be an acknowledgement of funding from American on some of the publications that came out.  In terms of the specifics of where that money was going, I don't know, I'd have to look at specific documents to see what was disclosed there.

Q.  All right.  But nothing is revealed according to this document alone; correct? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Nothing about his funding or his salary or the fact that his associate, Dr. Larson, was paid,

his entire salary being paid by the American Tobacco Company, nothing like that is revealed in this document.  Will you agree with that?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Wo, but it is revealed that he has reviewed thousands of articles on the subject, and ultimately culminating in a substantial publication, the Larson-Haag-Silvette publication.  So he is a well-regarded researcher in terms of he's very knowledgeable, in this case thousands of articles on the subject.

Q.  Okay.  And so moving on to the last paragraph.  "The situation reinforces Dr. Haag's opinion that we obtain a well-known and recognized influential physician to replace him at his retirement since Harvey's presence on the council probably was the most important factor in preventing any action by the AMA."  Did I read that right? A.  That's what it states there. Q.     All right.  Well, let's take it apart. This situation.  What situation are they meaning? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm assuming they're referencing the situation in the memo.

Q.They mean the situation where the AMA

refused to pass a resolution because Dr. Haag got up and said I have reviewed the material and there isn't enough evidence.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Isn't that what happened?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I wasn't there.  I don't know, you know, if there were minutes of the meeting in terms of the different viewpoints on that committee, and was it the information from Dr. Haag that ultimately, you know, helped to influence the final outcome. Q.  Well, in the last paragraph it says Harvey --by his own -- his own statement, Harvey, who is Harvey Haag, right?  Says Harvey's presence, fight?  Isn't that Harvey Haag?  Last paragraph.

A.  I'm not sure if that's -- it could be.  I'm not sure.

Q.  It could be.  Well, what other Harvey is there?  It says, "Dr. Haag's opinion we obtain a well-known and recognized influential physician to replace him at his retirement Since Harvey's presence on the council probably was the most important factor in preventing any action by the AMA."

A.  It's most likely him, but it just seems

strange the way they go from Dr. Haag to Harvey, that's all.

Q.  That's strange?  Doesn't that mean they're on a first name basis with the guy they pay to go into the AMA and say don't pass a resolution?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Mr. Wilner, you don't need to push your arms at him. MR. WILNER:  Well, that's the way I do it. MR. LATHAM:  Well, you can do it straight up but not at him. BY MR. WILNER: Q.  Okay.

A.  Again I don't know what the grant or the financial relationship was with Dr. Haag.  It doesn't talk about that in this particular document.  He also is a well-respected scientist, medical researcher, and participated in these discussions at the AMA. And according to the way this document is written, that he played a role in influencing that decision. Q.  All right.  Back to the fourth paragraph, the last paragraph.  "The situation reinforces Dr. Haag's opinion that we obtain a well-known and recognized influential physician to replace him."

We obtain.  Who is the "we" in that sentence?

collaboration in terms of the tobacco research groups.  But obviously it appears that, you know, looking for somebody to help represent the company at some of these various meetings.  Obviously it says here that looking for somebody to replace him in the presence of this council, so he was obviously on the council.  But I don't know, it's hard to say what the exact relationship is.

Q.  Well, Dr. Cook, you just used the word represent the company, and your understanding of Dr. Haag going into the American Medical Association was that he was representing the company? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  He was saying I'm representing the American Tobacco Company?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  That's what you understand happened here?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm just saying there it's hard to say exactly from this memo what was going on, how the funding, what the arrangement was.  It -- it's hard to say what was --you know, what was revealed. Obviously it talks about revealing the review of the thousands of articles.  It doesn't say one way or the other whether he revealed any kind of sponsorship or

grants in aid or what have you.  It doesn't state that.

Q.  Well, if he went in there representing the American Tobacco Company, should he have revealed it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't know what the requirements were at this time with the American Medical Association in terms of revealing any -- you know, even if you are being sponsored by somebody else.  Today I know a lot of organizations require you to disclose any kind of sponsorship, or you know, companies or organizations that you're receiving funds from.

Q.  Dr. Cook, isn't it perfectly obvious here what happened to you?  Isn't it obvious that the American Tobacco Company bought the services of Dr. Haag, paid him for those services, and part of those services were to go into the American Medical Association and block them from passing a resolution against cigarettes?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It's � it's not clear to me from this document.  It appears that he went to the American Medical Association and was one who obviously helped on part of the discussions on this particular topic.

This seems to indicate that he was somewhat influential, but ultimately these kinds of decisions are not made by one individual, it's normally a vote by a committee.  And I don't know, again, what the financial relationship was at this time.

Q.  Says, "Harvey's presence on the council probably was the most important factor in preventing any action by the AMA."  Did you miss that part?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.  It's argumentative.

A.  It.says probably. Q.     Yes?  You have another view? A.  It doesn't say without doubt, or it says probably.

Q.  Are you willing to stake your credibility on -- on what you just said that you don't know? After reading this document, you don't know what really went on?

MR. LATHAM:  Mr. Wilner, I think it's inappropriate to be pointing a finger at a witness. MR. WILNER:  I'm sorry.

MR. LATHAM:  I think you know better than that.  Let's rephrase the question and start it over without pointing --

MR. LATHAM:  -- at him.

MR. WILNER:  She can read it back if he didn't get it.

THE WITNESS:  I think it's hard to say exactly what went on just from this one memo.  I don't have, you know, the minutes from board of trustees meeting in terms of what kind of discussion took place there.  I don't know what, if any, kind of financial arrangement Dr. Haag had, you know, whether it's with American Tobacco or somebody else at this point of time.  I think it's hard to make a lot of statements just based on one memo in isolation. BY MR. WILNER:

Q.  Well, wait a minute.  You know what Dr. Haag'a relationship with the Medical College of Virginia was, didn't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I understand that he worked at Medical College of Virginia.

Q.  Any other tobacco companies fund the Medical College of Virginia?

A.  There was -- I believe the Larson-Haag publication was funded by several other companies.

Q.  So the companies got together to fund some

of these things, including Dr. Haag? MR. LATHAM:  Objection. Q.  That's your testimony?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  They provided grants to fund, for example, a compilation of the smoking health literature.

Q.  Well, I'm not talking about the smoking health literature.  I'm talking about Dr. Haag right now.  That's what we're talking about right now. That's fine.  Do you think Dr. Haag was not only funded by the American Tobacco Company but by a group of tobacco companies working together? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There was some funding that came in from the industry group, but I don't know what other funding he received, you know, from other --from science industry or grants from NIH, for example. Q.  All right, let me direct your attention again to the last paragraph.  It says, "It's Dr. Haag's opinion that we" -- which we talked about was The American Tobacco Company, or maybe others working with them --"obtain."  The next word is obtain.  Do you see that? We obtain a well-known and recognized influential physician to replace him. Last paragraph.  See that?

Q.  Contract with to replace him since his presence on the council was the most important factor in preventing any action; is that what you're saying?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It was saying here that we obtain a well known, so it could be obtain, it could be do we see if somebody would like to work with us, do we need to contract with somebody, provide a grant.  I mean it's hashed to say, you know, what is meant by obtain here.  It could be a couple of different things.

Q.  Well, after you obtain something you own it, don1t you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Not necessarily.  Depends upon the terms of the arrangement on the contract.

lot of grants and aid are given, and you give the money to an organization, or a researcher, and then they are free, you know, to use that money as they see fit on some area of research.  And you know, whereas a more directed type of research under a specific contract where you're contracting with a lab to do specific things, there it's more directed.  So I think in this instance, obtain, it could mean many different things in terms of how the arrangement is worked out.

Q.  Dr. Cook, are you saying that your best understanding of this situation was that the American Tobacco Company had an arrangement with Dr. Haag that they would give him grants if he would go into the American Tobacco -- to the American Medical Association meetings and block their resolutions against tobacco?  Is that what -- is that your interpretation?

MR. LATHAM;  Objection to form. A.  I don't know what the arrangement was. Clearly Dr. Haag was a very well-respected researcher, and he was well versed in the science at the time.  And I imagine he had very strong views and opinions on the science at the time.

Q.  Well, that wasn't my question.  My question

was was it an arrangement with the tobacco company to go in and block the resolution of the AMA, if you know.

A.  I do not know.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  And nowhere in all the work you did to familiarize yourself with the American Tobacco Company did you discover this previously secret document.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  This.-- I believe this is the first time I've seen this document.

Q.  And if, in fact, Dr. Haag was paid to go in and block the resolutions of the American Medical Association -- strike that.

Was it a characteristic of the American Tobacco Company to attempt to buy influential scientists?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm not aware of that.  I mean I know the company provided grants to a number of different organizations to fund research.  I'm not aware of speoific statements where they are saying that they are, you know, buying some kind of influence.

This is a � a document that appears to be from the research and development establish British -- establishment British-American Tobacco Company March 1st, 1957.  Do you see that?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  There was publications out there alleging a causal relationship, yes.

Q.  And this says ZEPHYR, all in caps.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that a code, some kind of a secret code for cancer?

A.  I don't know why they use that particular code in this document.

Q.  I mean why would �

A.  � or name or --

Q.  Go ahead.

A.  This word ZEPHYR, I'm not quite sure why they use that in this 1957 document.

Q.  Well, I mean just, you know, just thinking about why people, or what logical explanation there could be, you know, if you use a code, first of all does the word ZEPHYR mean anything medically or scientifically to you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  Not to me.

Q.     So you know,   just thinking about it logically.      If people use  some  kind of  a code word,

does it mean they don't want other people to know what they're talking about?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't know why they used it.  I mean BAT would use a lot of for example acronyms, abbreviations, different names for projects.  I don't know why they chose this particular word, ZEPHYR, for this document.

Q.  Ever seen it written that way before? Cancer is really called ZEPHYR?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, A.  I haven't seen it used elsewhere. Q.  Does it seem to you that it's an attempt to be secretive about their discussion about cancer? MR, LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Um, I say I don't why they were using it. I mean when you read the document, it appears when they're talking about relationships between ZEPHYR and tobacco smoking, I'm assuming that they're talking about the -�-' the cancer, for example.  So I don't know how secret this is, because when you read it it seems obvious in terms of what they're referring to.

Q.  Can you think of any reason that they would code the word cancer other than secrecy?

A.
	I've not come across --

c
	BORSTAL?

A.

Q.
	Okay.  In fact the chemical that was found

to be in
	cigarette smoke not too long before then

was benzt
	opyrene, right?


	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.
	Benzopyrene was reported in smoke, yes.

	That was one of the first Of the aromatic

hydrocarbons believed to contribute to cancer and
	
isolated
	from cigarette smoke by Brown & Williamson;

correct?

that also

well.

cancer.

A,  Yes.

Q.  And the third paragraph down says, "The B&W lab has in the past made a partial isolation and identification of the aromatic hydrocarbons benzopyrene in both smoke and original tobacco from Raleigh blend cigarettes.  More conclusive evidence will be forthcoming from the chemical analysis." Did I read that right? A.  Yes.

Q.  When it says in the past, how long?  Row long ago did they do it?

A.  I don't recall specifically. Q.  Okay.  Now, surely the identification of a chemical compound in the smoke of Raleigh cigarettes would not appear to be a proprietary secret; would you agree with that?

A.  Hydrocarbons present in a specific brand of cigarettes?

Q.  That's what it says.

A.  I mean this was research on specific products.  I don't know what was disclosed on this particular brand of cigarettes.  I believe that it --that it was known that combustion of organic materials do yield aromatic hydrocarbons.

Q.  Well -�- are you done? A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  I'm -- I wasn't talking about combustion of inorganic materials in general.  I mean the Brown & Williamson laboratory evidently --correct me if I'm wrong -- thought it important enough to do a isolation and identification of this compound benzopyrene in Raleigh cigarettes, and write it up under the section called cancer.  So with that preface, what's my question?  I don't know.  Let me give you a question.

Didn't they -- didn't they think it was important enough?

Want me to say it again, or have you got it?  Want me to go over this thing again? A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  All right.  Didn't they think, people at Brown & Williamson, that it was important enough to write it up in this memorandum under the word cancer that they had found this thing called benzopyrene in the Raleigh smoke?

A.  Well, they probably put it under this section because of what was going on in the public literature about the potential role, of things like benzopyrene and aromatic hydrocarbons in relation to

cancer.  So that was probably why they put it under this section.

Q.  And what was going on in the relationship between cancer and this chemical benzopyrene that was found in the Raleigh smoke?  What was going on? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There was a lot of research going on around the role of aromatic hydrocarbons in terms of biological activity, and the company as part of trying to understand it wanted to investigate the methodologies.  It talks about partial isolation and partial identification, wanted to investigate in terms of refining their methods, and they just happened to choose in this case it looks like the Raleigh brand of cigarettes for their investigation. Q.  Well, that's not talking about biological activity.  This is under the section called cancer, is it not?

A.  It is under cancer, yes.

Q.  And benzopyrene was suspected of causing cancer, was it not?

A.  There was a suspicion, yes. Q.  And in fact benzopyrene had been proven to be an animal carcinogen; correct?

A.  I'd have to check, you know, in terms of

how exactly it was labeled at this period of time.

Q.  Well, don't they say it in this same memo, Brown & Williamson admits it?  They say, "Mo one has proved that the chemical agents like benzopyrene, which cause cancer in animals, will definitely cause cancer in humans."  They use the word "which cause cancer in animals,"right?  Last line on the page. A.  Excuse me.  They do state that on the last section.

Q.  So evidently to Brown & Williamson at least there Was no doubt that benzopyrene, which they found in the smoke Of Raleigh cigarettes, caused cancer in animals; correct?

A.  I mean here they do � it seems like they're assuming that which causes cancer in animals. You know, whether or not it will cause cancer in humans.  And I guess because it doesn't mean it's an association between benzopyrene and cancer in animals, they've put it under this section of cancer, Q.  That was my question.  Didn't Brown & Williamson, as evidenced in this memorandum, page 9, understand that benzopyrene caused cancer in animals?  That was my question.  Yes or no? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  They appear to state that in this case,

like benzopyrene, which caused cancer in animals. And then obviously when you have pure com- --you know, pure compounds versus a complex mixture of smoke.  But in terms of this statement here it says like benzopyrene, which caused cancer in animals.

Q.  All right, so they knew this caused cancer in animals, and they found this substance called benzopyrene, which they described as an aromatic hydrocarbon, not only in the tobacco, but the smoke of Raleigh cigarettes; isn't that right? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Here they said they did find it and made a partial isolation identification.

Q.  All right, was this the first time that this cancer causing ingredient, this cancer causing substance, benzopyrene, had been found in the smoke of cigarettes manufactured by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company?

A.  1 don't know.  I don't know when -- if this was the first time they found it in a Brown & Williamson product or not.

Q.     Well, you've looked at the archives, haven't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I just don't recall specifically.

Q.  Well, isn't this a rather important issue? Here we have all of this -- this going on in the medical literature about whether cigarettes cause cancer, and here, inside the company, the scientists working for Brown 6 Williamson find a known animal carcinogen in the product of their commercial cigarettes.  Do you feel that is not an important event?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think it's obviously important.  They were able to at least tentatively or partially isolate this material.  X know obviously methodologies in this time period were -- were very -- weren't as well developed as they are today, so this looks like it was some early work investigating this particular situation.

Q.  Well, do you think -- I asked you before, was this the first, and you said what? A.I just --

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.  He's answered the question.

A.  I just don't recall specifically. Q.  All right.  So it might have even been earlier that they found this carcinogen in the smoke?

A.  Could have been earlier.  I don't know.

Q.  All right.  And then you just mentioned it was partial, or they didn't have -- they didn't have as good a technique.  Well, as time went on this turned out to be correct; right?  The benzopyrene's in the smoke; right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So here they say, well, this is on Raleigh brand cigarettes.  Wow, when did they test their other brands?  bet's say Viceroy.  When did they test Viceroy to see if they had this carcinogen in the smoke?

A.  I don't recall the specific brands.  I know some brands, or some brands were tested at different points in time, but I don't recall specifically, you know, what the next brand was, or series of brands.

Q[.  Well/ don't you think �� don't you think that the people who were in charge of Brown & Williamson, if the scientists had come and said hey, we have just found a carcinogen, known carcinogen, which they said which causes cancer in animals, in the smoke of Raleigh cigarettes, would you think that the management should say well, golly, you'd best test the rest of our cigarettes so we'll know whether it's in there?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  These were early days.  They're obviously developing the methodology.  You normally start out, you know, with some product first.  Based on the fact that it is a combustion product, you would expect to see it in other cigarettes as well, because of the way it's formed as part of the combustion process. Q.  So you're saying now that the scientists and management of Brown & Williamson would have known at least from 1952 that this carcinogen was not only in Raleigh, but it was in everything they made.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It was potentially there.  And as programs progressed, the company investigated ways, you know, to reduce the levels of bensopyrene in smoke.

Q.  Well, I didn't ask you about that.  We're going to get into that in a minute.  But I'm talking about 1952, here they are, they've found this carcinogen.  So here's my question.  Let's say I was a consumer of Raleigh brand cigarettes.  Okay? 1952.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And for some reason I had heard that there was the possibility, at least, that these cigarettes

caused cancer.  And I wanted to �- to know whether a carcinogen had been found in my Raleigh brand cigarettes.  How would I know?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  1 don't know that particular point in time, but to say that in this case that, you know, one compound out of many thousands of compounds is driving the whole biological activity of smoke I think would be premature, because it's such a complex mixture.  But there was a lot of publicity about, you know, activity of cigarette smoke.

Q.  Well, surely -- surely, I say � Brown & Williamson, having thought it important enough to note that this carcinogen was found in Raleigh cigarettes, would have considered whether or not they should tell their customers that we have found this carcinogen in the smoke of the Raleigh cigarettes that you might be intending to buy, don't you think?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think because of the fact that at this time no one had proved that it will cause cancer in humans, obviously at this point in time it was just related to animals, the question is how does the animal data translate to humans.  So that's part of

it in terms of how do you translate this information from an animal test system to humans, and then also at what levels it's present at and what is the activity based on the specific level of the compound in smoke.

Q.  But wouldn't you think that the customer who was about to buy a Raleigh cigarette might have wanted to know whether or not there was an animal carcinogen in the smoke regardless of whether the company believed it would definitely cause cancer in humans?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't know what the customer would have wanted to know, but there was broad awareness regarding risk of smoking.  I'm not quite sure at this point in time what that would have added.  There was some other publicity about smoking and health in the '508 time frame.

Q.  Well, prove to me that there's any public presentation at all by Brown & Williamson or anybody else that Raleigh cigarettes had an animal carcinogen identified by the company, admitted by the company, to be existent in their commercial brand of Raleigh.  Prove it to me.

A.  I'm not aware of �- of something in this time frame where they provided data on Raleigh cigarettes.

Q.  Are you aware in any time frame where Brown & Williamson came out and said and admitted publically that Raleigh cigarettes had a carcinogen as found by Brown & Williamson in the smoke?

A.  Are you talking about the whole time of Brown & Williamson's existence?

Q.  Well, I don't know.  Tell me the first time if you claim they did.  I don't know.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection.  Is that a question?

Q.  He asked me and I was responding, as a courtesy to him and to you, to clarify my question. No problem.

MR. LATHAM:  If you understand the question, answer it.

A.  I don't know specifically.  I know that information has been shared on various constituents with some of the state regulators.  Information about general smoke chemistry from cigarettes was on some versions of the Brown & Williamson website.  But in terms of chemistry for the Raleigh cigarette in terms

	collected data in the past on our brands for work

	Q.  State regulators?

A.  I just think at this � at this point in time in the 1950's there was a lot of work going on to understand it, what levels are, what does it mean, in terms of human cancer.

Q.  I guess X didn't ask a question very clearly.  I'm sorry.  X didn't ask you whether there was work going on.  X asked you whether the customer, who was thinking about buying Raleigh, deserved to know all the information that was available about Raleigh, including whether it's � the company that made it had found a carcinogen in the smoke.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Can you answer it?

A.  I think if --you know, it's hard to answer.  There was a lot of information at the time about risk of smoking, awareness, reports of some of the constituents in smoke.  This was early work, early analytical methods.  X just think it would have been premature at this point in time to talk about a potential cancer causing component in smoke on a brand by brand basis with very little information and evidence to say that, you know, this compound in a complex mixture of smoke is correlated in some way with cancer in animals.

Q.  Well, it certainly has proven to be the case that human carcinogens are in cigarette smoke; correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Mow, and you said it was premature? What would it have hurt had Brown &  Williamson publically disclosed that it had found a carcinogen in the smoke of Raleigh cigarettes?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  What would it have hurt?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't know.  I mean as I said, this was early days in this time period in terms of what was present in smoke.  And ultimately, you know, it was found out that these kinds of compounds are generally present in cigarette smoke.  So I don't know in terms of your question.

Q.  Well, would it have hurt sales of Raleigh cigarettes or maybe Brown & Williamson's cigarettes

in general if Brown & Williamson had come out and said guess what, we found an animal carcinogen in the smoke?

MB. LATHAM:  Objection to form; beyond the scope.

A.  I don't know what the downside would have been at that point in time.

Q.  So you � you're saying that you don't think that for a customer to be told at a time when there was increasing awareness of the possibility that cigarettes were causing cancer, and at a time when Brown & Williamson and all the rest of the cigarette companies were denying that that was even possible, you don't see that there was any potential effect on sales of the product that was � would have been disclosed as containing a carcinogen?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form; beyond the scope.

A.  I think that was there was awfully broad awareness of the presence of these types of compounds in cigarette smoke.  I just don't think at this point in time with it appears like a partial isolation method on one brand, you know, there was sufficient information to go out there and talk about this information when you don't know ultimately what the

impact of finding one animal carcinogen in a very complex mixture of smoke would actually do. Q.  Well --

MR. LATHAM:  Let's take a break soon, Mr. Wilner,

Q.  All right, let me just finish this question.

So you're saying the company wasn't sure that this compound in and of itself caused cancer; right?

A.  No, I'm -- I mean it says here compounds like benzopyrene, which cause cancer in animals, but it talks about no one has proved that it will definitely cause cancer in humans at this point.  And that smoke is a very -- smoke is a very complex mixture.  And I think that the fact that to say that the presence of one compound in a complex mixture would be the one thing that's driving the potential risk of this product was premature at this point in time.

Q.  Well, did anyone think that benzopyrene was good for people?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  No, this is why the importance as part of his harm reduction program looked -- investigated

Q,  Didn't ask you that.  Last question on this document, we'll take a break.

When, if you say this was just premature or this was to early, blah, blah, blah, well when did Brown & Williamson publically disclose the existence of benzopyrehe in Raleigh commercial cigarettes? Date.

All right, let me give you a document to look at which is called -- and you can � - why don't you keep those.  Here's what I'm going to ask you before we go to the next one.  I have shown you four documents that I've called AM000300, BC000100, RC000300 � this is for the record � and BC00O200, just the ones I've talked to you about since the Surgeon General report.  Do you have any reason to think that or do you have any belief that they're not authentic documents and represent what I have --not the content, but just the fact that the documents are what they are?

A.  To the best of my knowledge they appear to be authentic.

Q.  All right, let me go on to the next one, then, without delay.  And that is AC001250.  And -^ thank you.  It's been up on the screen, and here's a hard copy.

A.  Thank you.

throughout the 1950's and up until and past 1961 which linked cigarettes and cancer; correct?

A,  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And.then and so assuming this to be who we believe that it is, Hanmer at American Tobacco, writing, there are three points of attack on smoke.  One, epidemiological or statistical, dash, this is the primary basis for the hypothesis. Two, pathological, Auerbach, metaplasia cancer in situ.  Three, chemical and biologic.  Biological. I'll continue reading and then ask you specifically

"Cigarette smoke has produced cancers on the skins of experimental animals.  Seventeen carcinogens are alleged to have been identified in cigarette smoke."  And he says there's no way in which we can refute 2 above, so let's take that apart if we could.

On the list, number 2, the one that's referred to as "and there's no way we can refute number 2" is called pathological, Auerbach, metaplasia cancer in situ.  Do you have an understanding of what Mr. Hanmer is referring to when he says pathological, Auerbach, metaplasia cancer in situ?

Auerbach study using dogs that were exposed to smoke.

Q.  Using dogs?  Okay.  Were you aware that Dr. Auerbach sectioned lungs, human lungs in the largest pathologic study in history of -- of lungs of veterans that had been preserved to observe pathologic changes in them?

A.  I don't recall that �that piece of work specifically.

Q.  And that work was done prior to the dog work.  In fact it was referenced � it was -- it was part of Auerbach's testimony in front of the Blackman Committee.  Did you remember that?

A.  I don' t recall specifically.

Q.  Do you know what the Blackman Committee is?

A.  I don't recall.

Q.  The hearings in 1954 on filter tip cigarettes; were you not provided with that?

A.  I know that there were hearings, but I don't recall what the name of the committee was.

Williamson believe that filter tip cigarettes were safer?

A.  The company was responding to consumer demand to have products with a lower tar yield.  And people like Wynder had proposed tar reduction as a way to potentially reduce the risks from smoking.  So that was one avenue, was to reduce exposure to tar, so the company was responding to consumer demand and also public health recommendations to lower the yields of its products.

Q.     Well, I didn't ask you that, though.  Did Brown & Williamson believe or take a public position either one that filter tip cigarettes were safer; that was my question.

A.  I mean at that point in time in the '50s, the company did not agree to say that smoking caused disease.  So in that sense the relationship between tar and cancer wasn't proven, but the company felt that -- you know, obligated to respond to consumer demand and also recommendations from public health. Q.  Well, I understand that.  That wasn't my question, though.  I wanted to know if you know whether Brown & Williamson -- and I'll include American Tobacco in this, too, fine � took either a public position or a private position as to whether

filter cigarettes were safer than non filter cigarettes, that's all.

A.  I don't recall them specifically, the company stating that filtered or at that time low tar cigarettes were safer.  They were responding to recommendations and consumer demand.

Q.  So they did not ever, to your knowledge, take either a public or private position that cigarettes were -- that filter cigarettes � I'm just trying to get straight -- that filter cigarettes were or were not safer; that's what I'm trying to figure out.

A.  I don't recall a � a statement where they say specifically that low tar is lower risk.  There were statements from others in the public community talking about the benefits of filtered cigarettes and lower smoke yields or lower tar from a health standpoint.

Q.  Did Brown & Williamson do experiments or studies on its own that proved that filter tip cigarettes were safer?

A.  There was obviously work done to look at the smoke yields from cigarettes with filters that showed reductions in tar and various constituents with the use of, for example, filter technology.

Q.  Not my question, though.  I wasn't asking whether they -- what the yield was.  I was asking in terms of human safety and the propensity to generate cancer or other diseases in human beings as used. Did Brown & Williamson have any proof that its filtered cigarettes were any safer to humans than its unfiltered cigarettes?

A.  There was work -- there also has been work done looking at, as I said, deliveries from filtered cigarettes and various types of biological tests looking at the effect of different levels of tar on whether it's the chemistry yield or the biology of the system.  And ultimately there was done externally in terms of other public health officials conducting epidemiology looking at the effect of filtered versus hpn filtered cigarettes, and that's obviously a large population study, that would suggest that filtered cigarettes present less risk to the consumer.

Q.  I'm going to talk about that later.  I wanted to get back to where I was,  Do you have my scribe plugged in?

All right, in the IJ directory I'd like you to call up SO006100.  New England Journal of Medicine.

electronic copy.  In front of you is an article by Auerbach and et. al. which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine January 17th, 1957.  And this is an attempt to refresh your recollection that Auerbach's work was first done on humans and not on dogs.  So first let me ask you, are you familiar in general with �? are you familiar at all with this publication?

A.  Urn, I don't recall specifically reading this one.

Q.  Okay.  The title of it is "Changes in the bronchial epithelium in relation to smoking and cancer of the lung."  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.     And the bronchial epithelium is what, in general?

A.  It's the cells lining the insides of the airway.

Q.  Okay.  And then if you take a look down here where it says material on the first page there, it says 150 patients who died and were autopsied at the Veterans Administration Hospital were studied. Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

	Administration Hospital, they were people and not

	dogs; is that a fair assumption?

3
	A,  Yes.

4
	Q.  And so does this refresh your recollection

5
	that Oscar Auerbach studied human bronchial

6
	epithelium in relation to cigarette smoke?

7
	MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.

8
	A.  I mean it obviously appears that this study

9
	involves humans.

10
	Q.  And you were not aware of what Dr. Auerbach

11
	found in examining the bronchial epithelium of

12
	veterans who were ex-veterans who were exposed to

13
	varying levels of cigarette smoke during their

14
	lives.

15
	A.  I don't recall looking back at this paper.

16
	Q.  Well, going back to what we have in front

17
	of us in the document from American Tobacco -- can

18
	we call that up again? -- that being AC1000250,

15
	under number 2, pathological, Auerbach, metaplasia

20
	cancer in situ.  Do you see that?

21
	A.  Yes.

22
	Q.  You know what cancer in situ means, don't

23
	- you?

24
	A.  I mean I assume it means that they found

25
	cancer in the epithelium.

	Q.  Do you know that among the heavy smokers

2
	that were studied by Auerbach in 1957, that the

3
	majority of heavy smokers had cancer in situ when he

4
	examined them?  Did you know that?

5
	A.  I would have to look at the actual original

6
	report to see what was actually said in that report

7
	regarding these particular types of cancers.

8
	Q.     Well, but you didn't know that.  If the

9
	report says that, what I'm getting at is you,

10
	sitting here today, didn't even know that.

12
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

13
	A.  I don't recall that particular paper.

14
	Q.  Well, this is something that in 1961, the

15
	Research Director of American Tobacco thought it was

16
	so important that he said he couldn't refute it.

17
	You see this paper?

18
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

19
	A.  He says there's no way in which we can

20
	refute number 2 above, which was one of three

21
	potential streams of evidence.

22
	Q.  Right.  And that's the one he said he

23
	couldn't refute, right?

	A.  That's what he states here.

Tobacco, after 19- -- after 11/20/61, ever admit, ever publish anything, ever make a statement to the effect that the work that had been done by Auerbach was not something they could refute?

A.  I'm not aware of such a statement. Q.     Sitting here today, in 2011, how important do you judge that it was in 1961 that it had been found that in the majority of people who were heavy smokers had developed cancer?

A.  I think it was one stream of evidence at the time in terms of amongst the different series of published work related -- relate talking about smoking and cancer.  And this talks about one stream, you know, you've got the epidemiological work, you've got the chemical and biological work, and then you've got some pathological work that was done, but I, as I said, haven't had a chance to review that paper to look at it in depth to be able to digest, you know, what the actual findings were and put them into context.

Q.  Well, to the extent that that changes, cancerous and precancerous were found in the lungs of smokers examined by Dr. Auerbach in 1957 and commented on by the American Tobacco Company in 1961.  To the extent that these changes and cancer

in situ existed, can you think sitting here of any possible explanation other than the cigarette smoke was causing it?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  I think it's hard for me to actually comment on this particular paper because I haven't had a chance to sit down and review it and to put it into context.  As I said before, it is one �- one particular piece of research, one stream of evidence. Q.  Well, let. me ask it in this way then. Hiram Hanmer, whom you have not talked to, right? A.  No, I have not talked to him. Q.  But you've read a lot of his material, haven't you?

A.  I've seen a number of his documents. Q.  How long was he the research director at American?

A.  I believe it was several decades. Q.  Where was he from? What was his training? A.  I don't recall what his background was. Q.  Was he � wasn't he the top scientist at American Tobacco up through the late '60s?

A.  He was one of the senior folks in the R&D organization, and obviously there are other scientists in the organization as well.

cigarettes were developing cancer in situ? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think the company expressed what its view was on smoking and health.  I don't recall them specifically talking about this article, but this was one of many publications in this period of time. Q.  Okay.  Let's look at BL000100.

MR. LATHAM:  Thanks. Q.  Thank you.  This is �

A.  I've got several documents here, sorry.  I don't know -- there's one here.

Q.  Did you get another one?  All right, let me see.  Maybe you got two copies.

A.  No, it's a different one. Q.  Well, that looks like some notes.  But you're entitled to look at whatever you've got.  But is that part of the same document?

A.  It was all in the same folder.  So do you want to have that one again?

Q.  No, you can keep that one.  Let's just look at what you got.  This is just a list of notes, and the end to it.  These are -- this is not part of the document, but I don't know how this lines up.  This is references.  So take a look at that.  I think that's part of the document.

painting to determine whether the mice would develop cancer on their backs after being painted with cigarette smoke?

A.  There was obviously work done looking at that assay, refining the assay, also looking at the effects of different types of technologies in terms of looking at the effect of smoke on the skin of animals.

Q.  Well, did they find that the animals got cancer from being painted with the cigarette tar?

A.  There were -- there were tumors produced on the backs of the animals.

Q.  And Project Janus was instituted when? A.  In the '60s time frame, I believe. Q.  And it was '-- and was Project Janus published?

A.  I mean Janus was a very long project looking at lots of different things.  So I'm not sUre, recall specifically what was published from that work.  There was a lot of work looking at technology assessments to see if they impacted the tumorigenie activity of smoke.

cigarette design may change the amount of cancer that you get on the backs of mice; true?

A,  It was part of, you know, building the stewardship program to make sure that changes that were being considered would not increase the activity in that particular assay, for example.

Q.  Changes that were being considered would not increase.  That's all it was for?

A.  Well, also as part of a program looking at ways to reduce the activity, and what kind of parameters changed the activity either up or down. Trying to understand what impact cigarette design parameters have on this particular assay itself.

Q.  Well, what kind of parameters affect how much cancer the mice get?

A.  It looked at a wide range of parameters. Q.  For instance.

A.  It could be things like smoking regime. Q.  What does that mean?

A. How the cigarettes are smoked. It could include things such as different filter materials. Blend additives.

Q,     Blend additives?  All right, let's start with the first.  And I'll go back and I'll let you put more in later, but I didn't want to get too far

MR. LATHAM:  So---

Q.  I know he's going to list more, but I want to go back so I don't get lost. So how they are smoked? A.  Yes.

Q.  So it matters how you smoke a cigarette how much cancer gets on the backs of these mice?

A.  This � on the machine smoking methodology depending upon the size of the puff and the frequency of the puffing, work done looking at the effect of that in terms of the assay, and the impact on the tumors.

Q.  Does it make a difference whether you take a big puff or a little puff and how much cancer comes out of the cigarette?

A.  There were some differences.  I don't have the document in front of me that describes some of the effects that they observed.

Q.  Well, that's why I was trying to ask you. I mean you -- I said is there a !� there are -- what amounts for the differences, and you started off and you said how they're smoked; right?

A.  Yes, and as I say, I don't have -- you know, have the document in front of me in terms of

the findings, but they looked at, as I said, a range of smoking parameters, and what impact they had on the activity.

Q.  All right.  And I want you to -- I want to go into that first.  Then I'm going to go back into the other stuff.  But the range of smoking parameters.  Tell me what you mean.  What are these smoking parameters?

A.  Well, it's--as I said before, it depends

upon how you smoke the cigarette in terms of the size of the puff.

Q.  Size of the puff.  What else? A.  And the time that I take the puff for.  In terms of typically it's a two-second puff on a cigarette.

Q.  Wait, wait, I just want to make sure I understand.  The time?  You mean how long it takes you to take the puff? A.  Yes.

Q.  So typically it's two seconds?  Isn't that the same as the size of the puff?

A.  Size of the puff, for example you have a 35 cc puff �

period of time.  Then there's a certain interval between when you take the next puff.

Q.  Oh, so the two seconds is the interval between puffs, or is that the time that you're actually puffing?

A.  Time that you actually puff on the cigarette.

Q.  Okay.  Size of the puff.  The length.  Call that the time or the length, the duration of the puff; is that fair? A.  Um-hmm.

Q.  Okay, so I got two now.  One is the size of the puff, one is the duration of the puff.  What other are these smoking parameters that affect the amount of cancer that the cigarette delivers? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, A.  Here we're talking about what impact it has on a � on a model, the mouse skin painting model. Q.  Fair enough.

A.  As I say, I don't have the document in front of me in terms of the other parameter in terms of the time between the puffs.  Typically you take a puff every 60 seconds.

Q.  Time between puffs. A.  Yes.

Q.  And typically that's 60 seconds.  All right, any other things that go into the smoking parameters that affect how much cancer is caused on these mice?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to form.

A. Again I don't have the document in front of me, but that was some of the types of parameters they looked at, was how the cigarettes are puffed.

Q.  Well, if you can tell me what document you're looking for, maybe we got it.  You want to look for what, Project Janus?

A.  There was a summary document on Project Janus.

Q.  All right, what time?  Or what year?  I'll look for it right now.

A.  I think it was about 1990.

Q.  Well, I've got Project Janus 1966, importance of benzopyrene.  In Project Janus 1967 and 1980, the mutagenicity by the Ames test in Project Janus.  But those aren't the end of Project Janus evidently, right?

A.  Janus was a lot of biological work.  I believe there was a summary written in around 1990.

minute, but I'm just trying to get the basics here. So one of the things you said would affect the amount of cancer on these mice is smoking parameters, and you named three:  the size of the puff, the duration of the puff, and the time between puffs; right?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. A.  That would be an example in terms of the parameters.  Again you would have to look at the specific work to see specifically how they actually varied on there. Q.  Okay.

A.  And looking at the effect on, for example skin painting or some of these other assays.

Q.  All right.  Well since you've brought up skin painting of mice, let's talk about that first, and we can talk about the others later.  But one thing at a time.  We'll talk about skin painting of mice.

Now, you talked about the size of the puff. Does a big puff give you more cancer or less cancer? A.  Again I need to take a look at the actual report to see how that data came out.

Q.  Well, I mean�- and I'm happy to try and find the report, but wouldn't it be pretty important

In general to know If actually the size of a puff would affect whether -- or how much cancer would be delivered by a cigarette; wouldn't that be something that would be well known? Wouldn't that be important to know?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I think that this was an experimental system using it as one of several types of assays to assess the effect of various parameters in terms of tumorigenlclty of smoke, and it's part of the weight of evidence trying to understand the impact of some of these changes from biological activity of smoke. Q.  That's what they're trying to do.  So they did an experiment.  They tested the difference in puffs, whether it was long puffs, short puffs, long time between puffs or not, to determine how much cancer is going to get on the backs of these mice when they get painted.  That's what we've been talking about, right?

A.  Yes, as I said, looking at the effect of different parameters on the tumor, and on the tumor promotion assay.

Q.  And they found out, right?  They recorded it, right?

A.  There was information generated as part of

impact of smoking regime.  There were lots of other variables evaluated -- blend components, filters, et cetera � for part of, you know, product stewardship and also to provide direction to the product developments in terms of technology development, to address biological activity of smoke and various chemical constituents of smoke, et cetera.  And those technologies which showed promise in these tests and were commercially viable were actually incorporated into the products.

Q.  I'm going to get to that.  But I was � you brought up how it's smoked makes a difference.

MR. LATHAM:  Mr. Wllner, you don't need to lecture him.  You asked him what did they do with it.  That was the question you asked him.

Q.  All right, there's no point in debating. All right, you brought up how it's smoked makes a difference in this test.  Did I get that wrong?

I want some basics.  I mean if puff size affects how much cancer is caused, this would seem to be a very basic idea that would be important for all smokers to know.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. Q.  Now, do you disagree with that? A.  I think you have to put it into context. This was just one assay that was being looked at. Because there are other bioassays being looked at, such as Ames assays, inhalation assays, various types of chemical tests.  So there was a whole range of information coming in about how best to assess the biology and chemistry of cigarette smoke, and kind of provide some direction in terms of product developments and new technology development.

Q.  Well, did Brown 6 Williamson ever issue recommendations to its smokers, to the customers, about whether they should take big puffs or small puffs on their cigarettes?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I don't recall specifically what Brown & Williamson said to its customers.

Q.  Well, you've looked at the scientific side of Brown & Williamson -- Brown & Williamson's history, right?

A.  As best I can, yes.

Q.  All right.  Did you see where scientists from Brown & Williamson or BAT advised the company that they should tell their customers, hey, you'd better take big puffs, or maybe you should take small puffs, but that's what we found in our tests, our cancer tests?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  I'm not aware of such a document, but again, as I said, that was one of many types of tests performed at a time to assess the impact of various variables or various biological end points or chemical end points.  So you have to look at it from a weight of evidence standpoint in terms of significance.

Q.  All right.  Well, let's ask you then, what are these other tests?  First I've got mouse skin. Cancer on -- excuse me, cancer on the skin of mice; right?

A.  That's one example. Q.  What's another one? A.  Would be inhalation testing. Q.  So under that, what do you do?  Get a � you get an animal and you put smoke in their cage and get them to breathe it and then you take a look

A.  Basically the animal would inhale smoke. And then you'd do a examination of their � of their lungs or other body organs --

Q.  Okay.

A.  � after the experiment.

Q.  What else?

A.  There would be things such as some of the in vitro cell tests.

Q.  Right.

A.  Such as the Ames assay, for example.

Q.  And an Ames test is basically a test for DNA or chromosome damage of microorganisms; right? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  It's a term for mutagens, whatever you're testing.  In this case it would be smoke.

Q.  But a mutagen biologically means what?

A.  It causes a mutation, a change in the DNA.

Q.  And does cigarette smoke cause changes in DNA?

A.  Cigarette smoke is � is mutagenic in this type of assay.

Q.  So your answer is yes, it causes changes in DNA?

A.  Yes, in this particular assay, yes.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  This is one assay that does.  It looks at mutagenicity of cigarette smoke and the changes thereof.

Q.  Well, you have no doubt that cigarette smoke causes DNA changes in human beings, do you? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  There is changes.  I mean obviously, as science has evolved, getting a better understanding of what's going on at the molecular level in terms of human disease.

Q. I didn't quite follow your answer. Yes or no, you don't doubt that cigarette smoke causes DMA damage -- DNA mutations in human beings?

MR. LATHAM:  I've got a double objection. You've got a couple of double negatives there.  Mr. Wilner, that may be the problem with the question.

MR. WILNER:  There may be problems, but usually we've been muddling through, haven't we?

MR. LATHAM:  I know, but with a double negative it makes a difference.  All I'm saying is I think he can answer your question if you can rephrase it a little bit better I

A.  The -- cancer is a very complex process ultimately resulting in -- in a cell that mutates and grows into a cancer.  So there's a whole chain of events that takes place, and we still don't fully understand the whole chain of events for all of cancers in terms of how that initial exposure to a particular agent or compound or smoke ultimately culminates in cancer.  But obviously over time we're getting a better and better understanding of some of those processes and continue to research that, as well as other researchers outside of the company. Q.  Well, when would you say that Brown & Williamson had understood that DNA mutations occur as a result of cigarette smoking?  Let's look at BL000900.  And it may be in the big set.  It's either in number one or in the big set.

You can hold off on putting it up. I want to ask the question first. BL000900. Just ask the question first.

A.  The one about when did we know about DNA changes.

Q.  Yeah, that one.

A.  I don't know for sure.  I know certainly the Ames assay was starting to be used I think in the early '80s time frame.  So in terms of the Ames

assay, from a mutagenistic standpoint.

Q.     Okay.  You say the early '80s?  And you say as to Ames; right?

A.  I believe so.  I'd have to check that.

Q.  Well, how about with people, not with bacteria?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  I don't recall a specific date in terms of people.

Q.  Well, was it after 1980, do you think?

A.  Well, 1980 was in the '80s time frame was when the -- well, the Ames assay was sometime in the '70s when it was first under development.  But I think it was in the '80s time frame when the company started to look at the utility of that test as part of a potential way to assess the biological activity of smoke.  Obviously it's a bacterial cell culture, but obviously the smoke was mutagenistic and also causing changes to the DNA.

Q.  Ames tests are used as screening tests for substances that may cause cancer; isn't that right?

A.  Urn, yeah.  I mean it's one of the tests that's used for mutagens, and -- or muta- -- not all mutagens cause cancer; not all cancers -- you know cancer materials are mutagenistic.  But it is one of

the screening tools that's used to assess the mutagenicity of a particular material, whether it's a new drug, a flavoring material, for example.

Q.  And causing mutations in the bacteria used in the Ames test is considered failing the test, isn't it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  It depends upon in what context it's being used.  For some -- example pharmaceutical evaluations when they're screening materials, they use that as a tool to screen out some of the pharmaceutical products, for example.

Q.     Screen them out because they cause mutations and they would be suspected as causing human cancer; right?

A.  Urn, potentially.  I mean that's obviously dealing with a..-.- a bacterial culture system, and trying to extrapolate from a single cell tissue culture system with bacterial cells to whole animal or human, so it provides some direction to the researchers of the potential for the agent or agents that you're evaluating.

Q.  Well, has Brown 6 Williamson then tested its products using this Ames muted -- mutation test to determine whether their products cause mutations

A.  Aims testing has been conducted on -- on cigarettes, and cigarette smoke is mutagenic in this assay.

Q.  Well, has "-- has Brown & Williamson tested the Raleigh cigarette smoke, the one they found the carcinogen in in 1952, and see whether it caused this -- these mutations in these bacteria?

A.  Obviously I don't recall specific brands that were tested, but in general when cigarette smoke is evaluated it is actually active in the Ames assay. Q.  Well, you mentioned just a little bit ago, before we go further into Ames, I think you said --first we talked about -~ I was asking you about what effects � what changes would result in different effects on the mice on the amount of cancer.  And you said one is how they were smoked.  And we talked about that a little bit.  And then you said something to do with filters'-- blend components and filters may affect the results of these cancer tests in mice.  Do you remember that?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  Talking about the effect of some of these design variables On the tumorigenicity --Q.  Sure.

trying to find some designs and materials that can give you some kind of consistent biological response across multiple types of assays.

Q.  Well, let's go a step at a time.  I mean do some brands that you at Brown & Williamson or American made in the past have flue-cured tobacco? A.  The products that for example Brown & Williamson and American typically made were a blended cigarette in which it's a blend of flue-cured, burley, and oriental tobaccos.

Q.  Well, do some have more flue cured than others?

A.  There are some that have slightly different ratios of the different blend components.  But as I said earlier, the dilemma is that in some assays, the flue cured gives a higher biological response, in others the burley gives a higher biological response. So which assay is most appropriate?  How do you rationalize that?  How do you relate those findings ultimately to the humans?

Q.  So you're saying that there was -- there was a dilemma provided to Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company about how to take the cancer out of the cigarette.

A.  I wouldn't say a dilemma.  I think it was a --it's a very difficult scientific challenge at seeing how can we modify the chemistry and the biology of cigarette Smoke, and also what are the most appropriate ways to evaluate the cigarettes themselves --

Q.  I thought --

A.  -- and in trying to look -- deal with unintended consequences, because sometimes when you make one change over here, you see an adverse change on the other side.

Q.  Dr. Cook, you used the word dilemma, didn't you?  Then, when I asked you, you said oh, I don't mean a dilemma.  Didn't you say it was a dilemma?

A.  I don't recall.  I mean maybe I did.  I mean it's a challenge.  A dilemma that we face is trying to deal with how to best assess products, stay current with the technologies in terms of how do we assess our products, and do everything we can to try and address the chemistry and the biology of the products.

Q.  Is it a dilemma to Brown & Williamson that you can't get the cancer out of the cigarettes? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

many years in an effort to reduce the biological activity of cigarette smoke.  There have been a number of developments over the years trying to move in the direction of reduced activity, whether it's through, for example,(general reduction techniques, and some of the novel technologies that have been developed over the years in an effort to try and reduce this in terms of, as I said, general reduction, reducing yields.  We've also investigated, for example, selective reduction and other approaches in an effort to try and reduce the biological activity of smoke.

Q.  Well, all right.  Well, that's fine.  But

what ^'f e ^aIking about here is -- what I wanted to

talk about was just one thing at a time.  Let's talk

about flue cured versus burley.

Now, which is safer, a cigarette that has

more flue cured, or a cigarette that has more

burley?

A.  I don't know.  I mean I know when you look at the epidemiology comparing a market that is traditionally flue cured versus a market that has a blended product of burley, flue, and oriental tobaccos, the epidemiology is very similar.  So in t^at sense it's hard to rationalize that versus some

of the skin painting activities.

Q.     Well, is that part of the dilemma,. that all of this research that was done on Ames tests didn't tell you how to take the cancer out of a cigarette? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form.

A.  Looking at the Ames activity, trying to give us some ideas of what might influence that particular assay, but as I said before, you may have a low activity there, but a high activity in the dermal.  So these are things that we've had to look at in terms of our design program.  Actually one thing which from a toxioologioal standpoint is if you can reduce the dose, then you've reduced the toxioologioal effects.  So in terms of general reduction, it's one of the things that is one way to kind of deal with this, is the challenge that we face.

Q.  Okay, so which has less cancer on an Ames test, a Viceroy or a Kool?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

A.  They would be within the typical range that you would see in the marketplace of those types of, you know, blended cigarettes.  Because the -- the assay for, you know, was originally just for a screening tool, and then, you know, we're using it to

look at relative changes to give us some direction from a risk reduction approach, as well as from a stewardship standpoint.  And so cigarettes, you know, would fall within a certain range, and we're looking at is there a movement that would result from a harm reduction program where we can bring that activity down.

Q.  All X asked you is which has less activity, a Kool or a Viceroy.  That's all I asked you. MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  X believe they're very similar in terms of activity given the sensitivity of the assay.

Q.  Well, which brand has the least activity, as you call it, cancer under the Ames test? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. A.  As X said -- as X said, the -- there is a range of responses, and the activity that you would see across a range of cigarettes would fall within that range, and X don't have, for example, core values memorized, for example.

Q.  You don't have them memorized; is that what you said?

As I said before, the -- the Ames assay it one of a number of assessments that take place when we're evaluating changes or new technologies, depending on the nature of the change.  There are certain tests that we do.  So it's one of several evaluation techniques that we use.

Q,     All right.  Well, then the ones I had so far were cancer on the skin of the mice, an inhalation test with inspection of the lungs, an Ames test.  What else?  What are your other cancer tests?

Hre. Keith Shipley gutton, III 93 Joralenon Street Brooklyn 1, Rev Tork

Bear Mrs* Suttoni

Thank you very much for your letter of October L relative to a nedleated cigarette* .

V* velcone the opportunity of pretenting our vieve to anyone vbo le die-turbed by the recent publicity regarding the alleged effeote of smoking upon healthi In the first place, if you vill note carefully the subject natter of the articles ciecussing the possible effeote Of cigarette smoking upon health, you vill find no proof and very few factef Tou vill see, under a headline condemning cigar*ttee, the statementsi "we believe111"it le indicated"j or, "there ie a close parallel betveen the lncreaeed consumption of cigarettes and the lnoreaee in eaeea of jlung cancer"*

To ue the subject le by no means nev. Tobacco has been under fire, ae a threat to health, for more than 3$0 years, and cigarettes have of ten been singled out as a special target* During the long debate prtbtloally every disease of the human body hae been ascribed to the use of tobacco* One by one, these charges have been dropped for lack of evidence, usually after the real cause vas found*

Although there hae been no acceptable evidence that cigarette smoking, In moderation, le Injurious to the health of normal Individuals, The American Tobaooo Company has taken these chargee seriously end has earnestly endeavored for e number of years to determine, through scientific research, the relation betveen smoking and health* fhie vork le continuing, vith increased vigor*

In order to etudy this entire question the tcbaeoo companies have joined to form the Tobacco Industry Beseareh Oommlttee* This connlttee has secured a Scientific Advisory Board of outstanding authorities, men prominent In medicine or science, all vith a vide knowledge of cancer and cancer research* Briefly elated, the purpose of this organisation ie to support "research effort into all phases of tobaooo use and

Kre. Keith Shipley Sutton, III      - 2 �                       October Hi, 195?

Kov, as to your suggestion regarding the nanufaoturs of a medicated or nicotine-free cigarette, may I say that nieotlns le considered one of the Important constituents of emoldng tobacoo products*   The reason Is ee veral�fold.   It Is � related to taste and palatablllty and contributes to the sstlefnotion derived from smoking.   Hicotine Is hot cumulative and, in the quantities imbibed by a smoker, Is very rapidly deatroyed by the liver end certain other organs of the body.

For nary years", and vlth notable success, ve have controlled the nicotine content of our brands at a level as lov as is considered compatible vlth full smoking enjoyment.

It is possible to remove all of the nicotine from tobacco, but it has bean our experience that the resulting cigarette or cigar la an emaaou-lated product which is neither palatable nor satisfying to tha smoker. It is extremely doubtful If a fully denicotinited product would find favor with any acoustoaed arooker.

Ve eympathice with and readily understand your concern regarding your husband's health. V� sincerely hope that your feara will prove to be groundless.

Cordially yours,

R* R. Hanmer Director of Research

b.  Th'it this group, like older age groups, shows a smaller percentage of smokers in 1955 than in 1953*

3. There foilo'e a listing of possible ways to counteract the anti-cigarette propegond-- among young people vho will short] enter the important 18-25 age group:

a, Direct refutations of anti-cigarette claims.

These h/vre been handled in a very restrained way by T.I.B.C.    However, it may not be desirable to associate the Company or its brand names with the medical issues in the minda of young persons.

b. Affirmative material on the place of tobacco in American life.

The logical cho.:nel by�hich to approach young persons on this subject is through their schools.    The standard means aret

(1)  Films and film strips

It is  tot the Compony�s policy to make available "The Golden Leaf" to schools.

Mew Research Study Contradicts Anti-Cigarette Theory Not One Death X^9Jl_?rll!!^Xy^^y5..J^J^wn? JtaJ^ikJ^S^)l.XP-^fi

The American Tobacco Company sent to employees today results of now research studies covering mors than 1*1 years which, according to tho authors, show that 13,000 employees In tho Company's cigarette %gj.          factories smoke more, live longer and have had fewer deaths from

oancer or heart disease than the general public.

Although their cigarette smoking rate is twice tho b\ S. average, tho study points out that this heavy smoking group showed only 71$ of tho average death rate and only 71$ of tho average inspiratory cancer rato over a l^l-yoar period. Tho same group did not show a single death duo to primary lung oancer during tho 1957~19t>0 period.

These findings wore made public today in an article by Jacob Cohen, Ph.D., and Robert K. Heimann, Ph.D., published in the March 196P-issue of industrial Medioine and Surgery,

CONFIDENTIAL

Clarence Newman, of the Wall Streo'fJpurnftl, informed me yesterday" � �that he is interested in doing a story on the "confused pioture about tar and nicotine reporting."  He asked if Brown & Williamson oould provide a spokesman to give tlie "industry's side" {presumably what is being done In the way of research, testing, and posture),   1 told him I would discuss this with my principals; he said there is no great rush, but lie would-like to have some indication of our interest as soon as possible,

In addition, I am reliably informed that a similar opportunity exists with

Life Magazine.                                                                                           �

~" -j-- "r                                                  i

Obviouely; the key word ie "confusion, " and anything we can do to confirm such a situation could work to our advantage/' provided:

(a)  The current methods of testing are shown to be fraught with numerous variables, and therefore give rise to misleading results;

<b)  The significance of "tar and nicotine" per seiB seriously questioned in terms of soientifia indlotnient and "established" ranges    � of hazard; and

<c)  The tobacoo industry is shown to bo assuming a highly responsible and active role In trying to clear up the confusion -in the public, 'interest. This would Involve the disclosure of our own plans for a testing laboratory, � our Initiative In offering cooperation to the FTC, our intention to do testing in a "glass case" stance, and our dedication to the most scientific procedures and skilled techniques in arriving at complete rosults.

* ? *

By taking advantage of these opportunities, perhaps we oan forcefully refute Reader'e pigeat'e criticism (in the November issue) of the industry's "deeply ingrained"'fliih-flajn" in reporting the faots about tar and nicotine content,

Rei    Burgeon Oeneral'e Conalttee on Byklng and_ Bealtb

Dear Jack]

On the question of whether the tobaoco Industry (either through the Tobaoco Industry Research Coanittee or through the Tobacco Institute Ino*) should file any Material with the Burgeon General'a OoMslttee covering the research activities of the Industry, it was originally hoped thatt 1) All technical or solentlflc data bearing on the,question sod available to TXBC should be filed by that organisation through its Bolentlffo Advisory Board, and 8) The Tobacco Institute should be the channel for sny Material to bo filed by or on behalf of the industry, relating to More general,, that is, non-sclentlflo, data the industry Might consider useful or helpful* Individual oonpanles - It was originally Intended � should not fllo.

This approaoh was In part weakened by the refusal of Liggett t Myers to pa rait the TIEC to be the ohannel for its scientific Infornntlon, L&V sot being a neaber of TIRO and having oonducted considerable research through the Instruaentailty of the Arthur D. Little Conpany* It le sy understanding, Moreover, that Liggett did not submit its report to the Ad Boo Conalttee for review but that Bred Baas exaalned and reviewed It before subMission. This was followed by Lo'rillard breaking the ranks and Making an Independent filing.probably eMphaslaing ltB work In respect of phenol content Of the nnoke and phenol jrenoval, although perhaps also dealing with filter efficiency In the ireaoval of gross tare and nicotine. I understand now that both Philip Morris and ATvo. have followed LUC's lead and will make Independent subnlealone. This leaves Brown a Wllllanson and Reynolds*

In this, state of affairs, it Is now virtually decided that Brown A Wllllanson should file sone sort of report but of a very general nature,1 it being felt that to be the duly one, or even to be one of only two, Manufacturers not (in effoot) appearing before the Conalttee would oreate s bad laprosslon* While X cannot speak With certainty �'; as to what Reynolds will or will not do, I a* convinced that if /'�,   < Brown A Willlaason would abstain from filing Reynolds would follow ' the sane course, and that, by the sane token, if Brown A Wllllanson files a report Reynolds considers It cannot be the only naverlok*

Brown & Williamson -Cigarette Suits

Addison Teaman, Esq,. Brown &} Williamson Tobacco Corp. 1600 West Hill Street Louisville, Kentucky

Dear Add*

I acknowledge your letter of April 29, 1963 together with Its enclosure.  It is indeed an unfortunate turn of events which requires each of the tobacco companies to file material with the Surgeon General's Committee.

I have carefully considered the draft of a proposed report prepared by you in cooperation with Dr. Robert: B� Griffith, and I am of the opinion that, with the exception explained below, it contains no material which would prove detrimental to the defense of a lung cancer case.

be e

M

�

In my opinion paragraph 2 on the first page should liminated completely.  This paragraph reads as followst

tt2. Although we do not feel that any direct connection has been established between smoking and health, we do recognize our responsibility , . J and that of the Industry to prepare ourselves to deal usefully with any possibility no matter how remote.�

The first olause of paragraph 2 appears to me to contain a possible implication that while Brown & Williamson does not feel there is any direct connection between smoking and health, it believes there may be an indirect connection.  In my opinion this implied admission might prove harmful in a Tung cancer case.  The last clause of the sentence contains the possible implication that Brown & Williamson believes that any connection between smoking and health is remote.  As we have frequently discussed, with, the passing of time, the defenses of assumption of risk and contributory negligence will loom increasingly more important; yet the validity of these defenses' is being whittled down by tobacco company utterances -to the effeot that there is no.risk, or that it is remote.

For this reason I believe that the last portion of� paragraph 2 should also be eliminated.

I recognize that the task of preparing a report on behalf of Brown & Williamson is painfully difficult and that something must be said.  In place of paragraph 2, I suggest the following:

"Brown Be Williamson has recognized its responsibility on,the question of a relationship between the use of tobacco and health and has acted accordingly."

While paragraph -2 of the first page Ib the only -portion of the proposed report which In my opinion might prove damaging in litigation, I make the following suggestions, pertaining to phraseology, for whatever they are worth, ,

I would insert the word "scientific" before the phrase "research facilities" in paragraph 3, page 1 in order to distinguish such research from medical research, which paragraph 1 of the report indicates is not being carried " on Independently by Brown-& Williamson.

fj :.>�/,;/."                        On line 6, page 3, it appears to me that a "to"

^""^  ?:\:. "�  ln�front of the word "supply" should be Inserted.  On

line 1 of the third paragraph, page 4, I would substitute �'.����;*�  the word "problems" instead of ^implications".

Sincerely yours,

Dr. James .11 � Hundley Assistant Surgeon General U.S. Public Health Service Washington, D.C.

Dear Dr. Hundley:                                                                 ,

Wo aro most appreciative of the Committee's invitation to manufacturers of tobacco products to submit comments and information pertinent to its inquiry on smoking and health. The problem of the relationship between the use of tobacco and health is, of course, a matter of broad public interest and one of vital interest to both the users and manufacturers of tobacco products.

Brown & Williamson concluded some years ago that it could best contribute to the wide and continuing medical and scientific research efforts in this area through sponsorship and financing of the program of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee. You &.Tet  oT course, familiar with its multi-million dollar program of research grants. The T1RC is filing extensive data with the Committee on these research results. We believe that provision of this data must be the most helpful and useful information whioh the industry and this Company can provide. We believe that our continuing support of the TlRC program is the most effective way in which wo can contribute to the quest of definitive answers to these critical questions.

Brown & Williamson has of course conducted, and is conducting, continuing research in the areas of the composition of all types of leaf tobacco and of tobacco smoke. We work continuously with both public agencies and breeders of tobaooo seed on means of control and improvement of product. We have commissioned studies, which have been published, on the effect of menthol, we have contributed materially to the development of cigarette filtering materials and filters. We will be glad to discuss any of these areas of research

A TENTATIVE HYPOTHESIS ON NICOTINE ADDICTION

for

The Brltish'Americen Tobacco Co. Ltd London

by C. Hasalbtch and 0. Libert

The physiological action of nicotine consists m the liberation of catecholamines both in the brain and In the (muscle tissues. This action Is responsible for the Induction of the immediate escape mechanism. Simultaneously nicotine activates in a specific manner the secretion or the . corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) In the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) In the entapttuitary. This letter hormone regulates the long-range fuhctlons of the escape mechanism, I.e., release of corticosteroids In the adrenals and mobilising of fatty acids and glucose from the reserve tissues,

The hypothalamo-pftuitery stimulation of nicotine Is the beneficial mechanism which makes people smoke; In other words, nicotine helps people to cope with stress, in the beginning of nicotine consumption, relatively small doses can perform the desired action. Chronic intake of nicotine tends to restore Oho normal physiological functioning of the endocrine system, so thel ever-increasing dose levels of nicotine are necessary to maintain the desired action. Unlike other dopfngs, such as morphine, the demand for Increasing dose levels Is relatively slow for nicotine,

In a chronic smoker, the normal equilibrium In the corticotropin releasing system can be - maintained only by continuous nicotine Intake.

It seems that those Individuals are but slightly different In their aptitude to cope with stressin comparison with a non-smoker, If nicotine Intake, however, Is prohibited to chronic smokers, the cortlcotropln-mleaslng ability of the hypothalamus ts greatly reduced, so that these Individuate are left with an unbalanced endocrine system. A body left in this unbalanced status craves for renewed drug Intake in order to restore the physiological equilibrium, This unconscious desire explains the e'ddlctlon of the Individual to nicotine.

The fat-mobllislnp activity of ACTH is physiologically fairly well understood. Let vs therefore take this part of tine physiolopical action of ACTH to compare physiological experimental knowledge with all-day experience of the habits of smokers. The facts are that a certain amino acid sequence of the ACTH provokes the liberation of free fatty acids from the adipose tissues. Increased FFA concentration In the blood diminishes appetite and consequent food Intake by Its .action on those hypothalamic centres which regulate hunger and appetite. It Is a wail know fact that fresh smokers show loss of appetite, and therefore loss of weight. Chronic smokers gradually turn to normal food intake, If nicotine Is withdrawn from these Individuals, the low FFA concentration In the blood provokes increased appetite, and therefor� increased food intake, or at least a permanent hunger feeling. This feeling can be satisfied either by increased food Intake or by renewed smoking,

Lsboretory experiments with rats confirm this mechanism; injection of nicotine Induces a maritad reduction In food Intake (n the beginning of the treatment. Chronic application of nicotine In the so-called "tolerant rats* shows after a certain time no difference in the growth curves between treated and untreated animals. Interruption of nicotine application provokes a marked Increase in food Intake of "tolerant rats", which increase, however, turns very rapidly to normal {In our experiments within on� week).

In conclusion, a tentative hypothesis for the explanation of nloottne addiction would be that of an unconscious desire to restore the normal physiological equilibrium of (he corticotropin releasing system In a body In which (he normal functioning of the system has been weakened by chronic Intake of nicotine.

It way be assumed that the medical profession is the group which it ' is swat desired to reaoh and convince. . We venture the opinion that they arc

r

less ekeptlQel.tban other' scientific eroups and are easier to convince, if properly epproaobed.   However they are Jealous of their prestige awl 'fearful of exploitation} therefore difficult to reeoh.

While oeobors of the chemical and allied professions are interested in the chenioal and physical nature* of tobeeco products end tobacco sncVe, the toedleol profession is interested in the eolence of tobacco only as it rein too to the effeoto of tobacco upon the sucker1e health*   Although a thorough knowledge of tobacco oluMftietry is indispensable for the nalntonanca of quality, the � average doctor would be quite unimpressed by the display of such knowledge and ignorant of its significance unless interpreted for him*   And he would resent any attempt 'to draw conclusions relating to health from chemical research   �

The only kind of research which way.be expected .to impress the medical profession Is that obtained by the pharmacologict or the physiologist in a biological laboratory*   It was a recognition of this fact that prompted us* to provide for a Biological Department when the Research toboratory was designed*

The biological researoh done by the Hedioal Oollege cf Virginia vn&or our research grant and by ourselves provide evidence that the alleged serious , effects of Sleeking 0n health ere being greatly exaggerated.   In fact, it appears likely that-impfirtial researoh will show that smoking has a negligible effeoi on the health of normal individuala;  But-thie would never be anepeotwl by reading . ' the oxtonsivo   medical literature on tobacco.

The totmeoo indintlry is very otaob 1a need of. cow friendly resoaroh in thla field,   the company that first engages in active Molotfioal research and publishes its results could not fail to impress the leaden, in the nodical profession with the iTAporta�60 of their work.   8aoh research Mould also provide material for an approach to the medical profession, if that was desired,   Gu.cn a novo would serve the doublo purpose of improving the attitude of the medical profession toward the tobacco Induehry end, particularly, reflecting credit upon tbe, company with tbe foresight to engage in the work.

In our Judgment, the connection with the Wedio&l ObXieso of Virginia has been very productive.   Aside Iron the Information ceoured through their res oar oh, wo Juvvo been impressed with the completeness with which the staff . of tho Uodlcal College had been "sold American".   1Mb enoouragee tbe belief that if our activities were better known, acre medical uen could be brought into the fold,   Wo fool, therefore, that mora enpa&els should be yleoed on biologioal research and that we should add to our staff in this departaent*

At present, we have over forty wen engaged in work on tho'oheoioel, physical and onsineefing phases of cigarette .(manufacturing.   We have only one phyelologictj he is doing biological research under our grant at tbe Medical College.   It is our feeling that we should continue with tho Medical College of Virginia as formerly*   They would assume all responsibility for the experiaente as far as the layaan is ooneewed and this would protect ua from any possible oritiolam from that source.

By developing its Biological Division, the Kesearoh laboratory should be able in a few year* to establish itself as an authority not only in the field of

ohewiloal research on tobacco, but also in the field of biological and' physiological research as they pertain to tobuooo,

Having our own Biological Laboratory would wake it, possible, to conduct wore estensive experiments, particularly on oompefcltivo brands, than seen* proper-in an institution which la publioly auppprted,   A* an insurance against possible    � attacks in the future, we ootid, to edventege, test everything wo use in our products.   Our records would then provide a clean Mil of health for every brand which We aarket, one which would be acceptable to the medical profeebion.

Obviously, all of the work don* In our Biological Laboratory would be kept strictly confidential, *e ore investigations in all other departments.

From time to time,' our ohenieal research would reveal situations which reflect the Company*c products to unusual advantage*   Short these situations arise, we shall be in e position to sake comparisons chemically, biologically end perhaps clinically.   The results of fruab comparisons might he of no sinall value In *dver~ vising.                                            �    �

In the above dleoussion, on attempt has been nade to visualise the advantage* which would accrue from an active Biological Division In the Research . laboratory.   For* the present, we should proeeed pith extreme caution in so far as personnel is concerned.

As a result of discussions with fo% hcllcy, Dr. Raag was ashed nearly a year ego to look about for a nan having tbs desired qualifications i   He should �combine ability and experience with a broodVxinded attitude toward the tobacco industry.   It was not until recently that Dr. Hsag could find any one whoa he considered well qualified for the position.  He has now recommended Dr. tarflen,'

There are three points of attack on smoke -

1,  Epidemiological or statistical - This is the primary basis for the hypothesis.

2,  Pathological - Auerbech � metaplasia cancer in eitu.

3,  Chemical and biological.

Cigarette snoke has produced cancers on the skins of experimental animals. Seventeen carcinogens are alleged to have been identified in cigarette smoke.

There Is no way in which we can refute (2) above.

Nyncer admits in scientific papers and publications that the known carcinogens account for no more than 3PS of the biological activity of smoke. This fact is not disclosed by him in press conferences. If he were aaked about 1t, he would answer (according to the new hypothesis) that these minute amounts of carcinogen are tha activators and promoted by something else in cigarette smoke.  At the moment, this something else is called phenols.

The only way we could ccsabat (3) above would be for us to conduct animal experiments and chemical analyses affirming the presence of carcinogens and production of cancers on animals, and to sake a point of the fact that 91% Of the carcinogens in cigarette smoke ere still unknown, Wynder could discredit this with his promoter theory,

\}p to the present time the only important contradiction of the statistical studies supporting the hypothesis of which Hammond and Horn is one, is Dean and Eastcott. The HBag- Hartmer paper was a move in this direction, but the number of person years was too small to carry weight. By contrast, this which includes both Horn and Baun and Haag and Hammer, is a long range study end compriees a large number of person years*

It Ehould receive the widest possible dissemination. It may be noted that we have been asked to supply our friends with emnunltion, particularly during the years when the attack upon the industry was most violent,

Hammond and Horn, Wynder and others often cited the accimnjlation of statistical studies which are mutually corroboratory. I think the latest count is 21,

This study, together with Dean and Eastcott, represents the accumulation of corroboratory evidence,

The effect of this article could not be expected to be revolutionary. It does represent the first blow against the hypothesis, particularly since Df, Cohen has made it somewhat argumentative and will say that it negates tha cigarette hypothesis.
