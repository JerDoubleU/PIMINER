12                   DR. MICHAEL CUMMINGS

13   having been first duly sworn by the Clerk, testified

14   on his oath as follows:

15             THE WITNESS: I do.

16             MR. SCAROLA: May it please the Court.

17             THE COURT: You may proceed.

18                    DIRECT EXAMINATION

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=3
21              Good afternoon to you, Dr. Cummings.

22        A.   Good afternoon.

23        Q.   Dr. Cummings, would you please tell the

24   ladies and gentlemen of the jury your full name,

25   spell your last name for us, and also tell us where 4096

1   you live and work.

2        A.   Sure. My full name is Kenneth Michael

3   Cummings. It's spelled C-U-M-M-I-N-G-S. And I live

4   in Williamsville, New York, outside of Buffalo, and

5   I work at Roswell Park Cancer Institute, which is a

6   comprehensive cancer center located in Buffalo.

7        Q.   Is the doctor as a consequence of a

8   medical degree or some other advanced degree?

9        A.   Some other advanced degree. It's a Ph.D.

10        Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, even before we

11    get into a discussion of your specific education,

12   your training, your experience, and the work you

13   have done to prepare to come here and to testify in

14   this matter, I want to ask you some very general

15   questions about the scope of your expertise and what

16   we can reasonably rely upon you to assist us with

17   during the course of these proceedings.

18             MR. SCAROLA: May I have the ELMO, please?

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   We are going to review your background,

21   but before we do that, can you tell us, please,

22   whether that background, education, training and

23   experience will enable you to assist us in

24   determining whether Charlie Piendle was addicted to

25   nicotine in cigarettes made and sold by the 4097

1    defendants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, is that

2   something that you will be able to address?

3        A.   It will be.

4        Q.   Can you tell us, please, whether you will

5   help us with answering the question about whether

6   that addiction was a substantial contributing cause

7   of Charlie's death, recognizing that you are not a

8   medical doctor, but understanding that medical

9   issues have been resolved, at least to some extent,

10   by the fact that the defendants concede that Charlie

11    died of lung cancer caused by smoking. Can you help

12   us with that issue?

13        A.   lean.

14        Q.   Next, sir, will you be of assistance,

15   based upon your expertise, in helping us to

16   determine whether the tobacco industry in general,

17   and these defendants in particular, significantly

18   contributed to starting Charlie's addiction?

19        A.   Yes, I can.

20        Q.   And will you also be able to help us to

21    determine whether they made a significant

22   contribution to keeping him smoking?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=4
23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   And finally, with regard to this point,

25   will you be able to help us in determining whether 4098

1   the tobacco companies, and particularly these

2   defendants, made it significantly more difficult for

3   Charlie to quit?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   Is the nature of your expertise such that

6   you can help to answer the following question?

7             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'm going to

8        object. I haven't seen these particular

9        questions. I believe this is a particularly

10        argumentative form of asking questions of the

11         witness. I don't mind asking questions of the

12        witness, but publishing them to the jury before

13        we've seen them, I believe, is inappropriate.

14             THE COURT: Let me ask you -- show it to

15        counsel first.

16             MR. SCAROLA: I did, your Honor, just

17        before we began, but I'd be happy to do it

18        again.

19             MR. KELLY: I have not seen these before,

20        your Honor.

21              THE COURT: Okay. Well, just take a

22        moment and look at them.

23             MR. KELLY: Can we approach so you may see

24        them as well?

25             THE COURT: Is there an objection to them? 4099

1              MR. KELLY: Yes, your Honor.

2             THE COURT: Of course you may approach.

3             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

4        held out of the presence of the jury:)

5             MR. KELLY: I didn't have an objection to

6        the initial page. What I flagged right away

7        here is this question of whether or not the

8        witness is going to make conclusions about

9        whether the company should be -- should be

10        punished. That's an argumentative question at

11         this stage of the proceedings, your Honor, and

12        presumes quite a lot of facts. That's not

13        something the witness should be concluding,

14        what's punishable, what's not. That's what the

15        jury may determine in this case based on

16        instructions you're going to be giving. That's

17        as far as I got.

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have gone through the

19        documents that relate to youth as best I can

20        that plaintiff has identified. There's nothing

21         to tie Mr. Piendle's smoking decisions as a

22        high school student to youth advertising.

23        There's been no evidence about that. In fact,

24        the witnesses repeatedly said advertising did

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=5
25        not have anything to do with it. 4100

1              Now we're going to get testimony about

2        specifically targeting youth like Charlie

3        Piendle. It's completely violative of your

4        order, what your Honor previously ruled on in

5        the motion in limine on the youth issue,

6        arguing predicate has not been established to

7        this point in the trial.

8             Allowing --1 haven't gotten past the

9        first bullet. But immediately, a very strong

10        concern was raised in my mind, and I looked at

11         the documents this witness is supposed to talk

12        about, and every single one of them is from a

13        date after Charlie Piendle started smoking,

14        which appears to me to relate to youth smoking

15        after he was a youth, well into adulthood.

16        They don't really --it's inappropriate under

17        your prior ruling as well as 403.

18             I have not gotten to this. Counsel did

19        show this to me literally before Dr. Cummings

20        took the stand, and I did not have an

21         opportunity to read it.

22             MR. KELLY: May I make the comment that

23        while these questions -- while you're holding

24        them, that they appear to be very cumulative of

25        Dr. Burns' testimony, with respect to 4101

1        Dr. Burns' testimony, with young people's

2        smoking initiation issues, what the health --

3        what the industry knew versus conclusory and

4        enterprise. But Dr. Burns spoke extensively

5        about that. And I guess the other is knowledge

6        too. This is just an argumentative way to

7        proceed, your Honor.

8             THE COURT: What is your response?

9             MR. SCAROLA: I am asking this witness at

10        this stage to inform the jury as to what the

11         scope of his expertise is. We are laying out

12        the areas that we intend to cover with this

13        witness, assuming he acknowledges that his

14        expertise will enable him to address these

15        issues.

16             This, at this point, is not evidence with

17        regard to any of those matters. These are

18        questions that can assist us in these areas,

19        does your expertise enable you to address them.

20        Then we'll talk about his expertise and how

21         they enable him.

22             THE COURT: On the preliminary issue of

23        what he is able to offer an opinion about

24        without defense waiving objections, it may

25        have -- to the actual offering of the opinion 4102

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=6
1         and whether that is proper or not, I will allow

2        this to be used as a demonstrative aid.

3             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

4        concluded and the following proceedings were

5        held within the presence of the jury:)

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Picking up, Dr. Cummings, where we left

8   off, can you tell us, sir, whether the nature of

9   your expertise is such that you will be able to

10   assist us in providing information about whether the

11    defendants engaged in the kind of conduct that

12   should be punished, and specifically, can you

13   provide assistance as to whether young people like

14   Charlie Piendle, during the period of time that

15   Charlie Piendle was confronting the decision about

16   whether to smoke and beginning his smoking history,

17   whether young people were actually being targeted by

18   the tobacco industry?

19        A.   I will be, yes.

20        Q.   Will you be able to help us by telling us

21    what the industry knew about the health hazards of

22   smoking during the period of time that any such

23   youth targeting was actually being conducted?

24        A.   I will be.

25        Q.   Will you be able, sir, to provide us 4103

1   testimony based upon your expertise about what the

2   industry knew concerning the powerful addictive

3   properties of nicotine at the very same time that

4   the industry was targeting youth like Charlie

5   Piendle while Charlie Piendle was in high school?

6        A.   I will be.

7        Q.   Will you be able to assist us in answering

8   the question about whether the industry, the tobacco

9   industry intentionally concealed knowledge and/or

10   purposely created uncertainty about the health

11    hazards of smoking during the period of time that

12   Charlie smoked from the 1950s through 1986?

13        A.   Yes, I've studied that question. I

14   brought along material to share with the jury on

15   that very question.

16        Q.   Will you be able, sir, to assist us in

17   making the determination about whether the tobacco

18   industry, including specifically these defendants,

19   intentionally concealed knowledge and/or purposely

20   created uncertainty about the strength of smoking

21    addiction while Charlie was smoking?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   Will you assist us, sir, in answering the

24   question: Based upon your experience, your

25   training, your formal education, and the study that 4104

1   you have done in answering the question about

2   whether the tobacco industry not only withheld

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=7
3   information, but also actively misled the general

4   public?

5        A.   Yes, I'm prepared to testify about that

6   based on my experience and the research that I've

7   done.

8        Q.   And can you also tell us, sir, whether not

9   only the general public was misled by the tobacco

10   industry, but whether public health officials were

11    misled as well?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   Is it within your area of expertise to

14   provide assistance in telling us whether, how, and

15   for how long individual tobacco companies worked

16   together to maximize profits in conscious disregard

17   of Charlie Piendle's welfare and the welfare of the

18   general public?

19        A.   Yes, I've studied that issue, and I've

20   brought evidence to share with the jury on that

21    question.

22        Q.   Can you also, sir, assist in answering the

23   question about whether and how cigarette design was

24   manipulated to deceive Charlie Piendle and the

25   general public? 4105

1        A.   Yes, I can.

2        Q.   And is it within your area of expertise to

3   address the issue of whether and how cigarette

4   design was manipulated to maximize the addictive

5   hold of smoking during that period of time, from the

6   '50s through the mid-'80s, when Charlie Piendle was

7   actively involved as a smoker?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   And if it is established that, in fact, a

10   coverup existed, will you be able to assist us in

11    determining how long that coverup lasted, when it

12   began, when it ended?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   That's a big piece of pie you bit off.

15   Let's talk about how it is you are going to be able

16   to do all those things. What has gone in to

17   establishing your ability to be able to address that

18   broad range of issues to assist us in answering

19   those questions?

20             So tell us if you would, please, first

21    about your formal education, Dr. Cummings. And

22   begin if you would with your graduation from high

23   school.

24        A.   I graduated from high school in 1971, West

25   Essex High School in New Jersey. I went on to 4106

1    actually come to school here in Florida for a

2   semester at Florida Southern College. Came to play

3   basketball. Found out that I wasn't going to the

4   NBA. So I had met my current wife in high school,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=8
5   she went to a little school in Ohio, Western

6   College, and right across the street was Miami,

7   Ohio. I transferred, and that's where I did my

8   undergraduate work basically from 1972. I graduated

9   from there in 1975.

10        Q.   What was the principal focus of your

11    undergraduate work?

12        A.   Health education.

13        Q.   Okay.

14        A.   And then I was going to be a schoolteacher

15   basically, health education, PE.

16             And during the time that I was doing my

17   undergraduate, I did a summer internship in

18   New Jersey with the health department and was

19   encouraged to go to graduate school and get a

20   Master's of Public Health.

21              The person I worked with in New Jersey had

22   suggested going to the school that they had

23   attended, the University of Michigan School of

24   Public Health. I applied in my senior year in

25   college and managed to get into the University of 4107

1   Michigan School of Public Health. They gave me a

2   scholarship so I could afford to go to school.

3        Q.   Let me interrupt you again for a moment if

4   I could. Was there a particular area of interest

5   that you had during the period of time that you were

6   getting your master's degree?

7        A.   Well, it was health behavior and health

8   education was the expertise for my graduate work.

9   So really the study of health-related behaviors, but

10   in terms of the effects on population health.

11              So in public health you're concerned about

12   the population of people in an area in terms of

13   things that are affecting their health, and health

14   behavior is one of the areas, epidemiology is

15   another, environmental health, nutrition science.

16   There's a whole variety. Healthcare service

17   delivery. Those are all sort of the basic elements

18   of schools of public health. So I had training in

19   all those areas, but my expertise was the area of

20   health behavior and health communications.

21         Q.   All right. And you were about to tell us,

22   then, about your Ph.D. studies.

23        A.   Well, I liked graduate school and

24   continued on after a two-year stint doing the

25   Master's in Public Health, and actually got involved 4108

1   in doing research, which is really what a Ph.D. is

2   about, you're involved in doing scientific research,

3   and got involved in doing studies as a master's

4   student on swine flu, the original swine flu

5   epidemic. I had done studies on people going to get

6   vaccinated and so on.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=9
7             Got interested in the nature of doing that

8   research. Got involved in publishing some of the

9   findings from a study that I got involved with at

10   that time. I applied to go -- continue with my

11    studies in a Ph.D. program at the University of

12   Michigan in health behavior. I again was fortunate,

13   they gave me a full-ride scholarship, a Rackham

14   scholarship through the University of Michigan. And

15   so I then continued to do my Ph.D. I finished that

16   workup in 1981.

17        Q.   Did you have the luxury of being a

18   full-time student throughout that period of studies

19   that you've described?

20        A.   I did. I did work as I went to school as

21    well, but, you know, my wife essentially, who I

22   married after finishing up my college degree and,

23   you know, she sort of carried me through graduate

24   school. We didn't live high on the hog, but we

25   didn't have any debt either, so that was nice. 4109

1              And I finished up in '81 and did a little

2   stint teaching as an assistant professor at Wayne

3   State University in the Department of Community

4   Medicine there, and then was offered a position at

5   Roswell Park Cancer Institute, and went there

6   actually in the early 1980s, I think '81 is when I

7   started at Roswell. So between '80 and '81, just as

8   I was finishing up my Ph.D., I was working at Wayne

9   State teaching courses in their graduate program.

10        Q.   You told us that you're currently working

11    at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Have you been

12   employed at the cancer institute continuously over

13   the course of that 30-year period of time, three

14   decades of work at the institute?

15        A.   That's correct.

16        Q.   Uninterrupted?

17        A.   Uninterrupted.

18        Q.   Then let's talk about if we could, please,

19   what is it that you do there on a day-to-day basis.

20   And probably it would be helpful if you took us

21    through that historically. What kind of

22   responsibilities did you have initially when you

23   became employed by the institute m,and how over time

24   have those responsibilities evolved?

25        A.   Sure. Roswell Park is a comprehensive 4110

1    cancer center. It's the oldest one in the country,

2   it's over a hundred years old. It's a freestanding

3   cancer center. So we're a cancer hospital and we're

4   a research organization. We have about 3,000

5   employees, roughly 300 M.D./Ph.D.s that work there.

6             And I was brought --

7        Q.   How many patients under treatment at any

8   given time?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=10
9        A.   We have 150 beds in-patient. There are

10   thousands of patients who come to Roswell every week

11   basically for out-patient care. So it is the major

12   center for cancer research and has established some

13   of the leading therapies. Childhood leukemia

14   therapies in the late '60s were developed at

15   Roswell. The PSA test was developed at Roswell.

16             Roswell has a long history actually in the

17   area of establishing the link between smoking and

18   lung cancer and other diseases. Some of the early

19   studies were done by scientists at Roswell.

20             And I was essentially hired to replace one

21    of the scientists who was retiring at that time in

22   the area of cancer prevention, which is the area

23   that I've been doing my work in for last 30 years.

24   I came in as a junior scientist.

25             And at a cancer research institute, I have 4111

1    an academic appointment at the State University of

2   New York at Buffalo. I've taught graduate courses

3   there and mentored several dozen, you know, Ph.D.

4   students, as well as probably 50 or 60 master

5   students in the time.

6             I've taught epidemiology, basically the

7   study of health behavior, for their public health

8   school that they have, and also a course on tobacco

9   control during my time and continue to do that.

10             People who work at Roswell are there to do

11   primary research. You write grants. It's publish

12   or perish. It's actually get grants or perish. So

13   quickly started to carve out an area of research in

14   a variety of areas of health behavior. Early on I

15   was doing studies on medication compliance of cancer

16   patients, adolescent leukemia patients.

17             Screening behavior is a big focus. We're

18   a screening clinic and we're doing studies on

19   various screening regimens and the effect of delay

20   in seeking care on prognosis for cancer patients.

21              And then early on in the 1980s, I got

22   involved in running a stop smoking clinic, which I

23   had a student undergraduate come work with me, as we

24   often do, still get students to come and be there

25   for a semester as we train them, and I had picked up 4112

1    some information when I was at the University of

2   Michigan, a colleague that I had gone to graduate

3   school with there had set up and did for his Ph.D.

4   program and set up a program called Smoke Stoppers,

5   which was a stop smoking program. That was his

6   dissertation, basically, and he had shared some of

7   that information, I had carried that with me.

8             When I arrived at Roswell, there weren't

9   really clinics going on. People called us looking

10   for services to help them stop smoking. And so I

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=11
11    established a program, we set it up, ran it with

12   employees, with a student for a semester, and it was

13   quite interesting, and some people did quit, most of

14   them went back to smoking. We got a lot of

15   families, friends, other employees who called, and

16   I've been running those clinics ever since.

17        Q.   And when did that work begin?

18        A.   Essentially, that started in around

19   January of '82 is when we set up the clinic. And

20   I've had thousands of smokers come to our clinics

21    over the years, as we're face-to-face. I've done a

22   variety of studies, so I've sort of got my research

23   in this area sort of going, and it was really

24   learning from the people who were struggling to

25   quit, gaining weight, some of the withdrawal that 4113

1   they experienced. Obviously, we've had now some of

2   the pharmacotherapy, the drugs that are available to

3   help people quit we've now tested, and that sort of

4   evolved over years.

5             I've done a number of -- started writing

6   grants, originally did some work with the Cancer

7   Information Service, which was an 800 phone number

8   that you could call for cancer information, set up

9   all around the United States.

10             Roswell was one of the sites, so we set up

11    a training for basically teaching the counselors on

12   the phone how to handle questions from smokers, and

13   I did some research around that, we actually set up

14   the entire training for the entire network.

15             And then in 2000,1 established the

16   New York State Smokers Quit Line, which is a service

17   that I've been running for the last ten years,

18   probably the largest one in the world. We have over

19   about -- last year it was about 250,000 New Yorkers

20   who called us. We do assessments of people's

21    nicotine dependence when they contact us, as well as

22   tailor their therapies and provide pharmacotherapy,

23   at least patches and lozenge, in New York state.

24   That's something that we've been doing and do all

25   kinds of studies around that. 4114

1              I've done big population studies following

2   people. So basically got involved in doing

3   research, and my research became very focused in the

4   tobacco area, success in getting grants, and it was

5   an interesting area, largely because of this

6   clinical service that we set up, and then it sort of

7   grew into what my career became.

8        Q.   Have you been the director of the New York

9   State Smokers Quit Line since the inception of the

10   quit line?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   And that was in what year?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=12
13        A.   It was 2000.

14        Q.   All right. So you got about a decade's

15   experience with the quit line, and over that period

16   of time, how many smokers have you dealt with who

17   have sought the help of the New York State Smokers

18   Quit Line in attempting to end whatever dependence

19   they had on tobacco and nicotine?

20        A.   We've had over a million smokers call us.

21    Last year, we did a press of that with the health

22   commissioner, a million New Yorkers had called the

23   quit line. We actually get many more because we

24   have an online service that we run as well. So it's

25   a big service and we do consulting all over for 4115

1   teaching in other places how to run their telephone

2   services, as well as online, and now all the

3   communications, Twitter, and all the other kinds of

4   things that I'm learning about, but it's a big

5   operation. Just the quit line alone has about 60

6   people who I manage through that program.

7        Q.   Are you strictly in an administrative

8   position there or do you actually deal directly with

9   persons seeking help with their nicotine addictions?

10        A.   Well, I deal directly with people

11   primarily through our clinics that we run. As I

12   said, I started running those programs in '82. I

13   ran them. I mean, the student was there. It was

14   nice when she was there for the semester, but she

15   left, and then we started running the program, and I

16   ran them and really enjoyed doing them. And there,

17   the face-to-face interaction was probably seen, you

18   know, 8- or 9,000 people through that program, some

19   of them recycled. I used to joke people coming back

20   for their Ph.D. and quitting smoking, because a lot

21    of the people would end up relapsing and coming back

22   to quit.

23             And then that sort of morphed more

24   recently into a variety of clinical trial studies.

25   We're doing a whole variety of studies now on 4116

1    different medications to help people quit,

2   combination therapies, patch, gum, and lozenge. And

3   we're doing a trial now with nicotine vaccine, which

4   was literally a vaccine we're giving people that

5   scavenges nicotine before it can cross the blood

6   brain barrier. It creates a big molecule so the

7   nicotine can't get to the brain to affect the brain

8   chemistry, sort of takes the reward away from

9   smoking. And people respond differently to vaccines

10   in terms of antibodies, so we're doing research on

11    that. It's a large trial that's going on. And

12   we've been involved and engaged to train people in

13   about 40 other centers how to do the behavioral

14   counseling that goes along with the vaccine

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=13
15   component of that study.

16        Q.   Now, is there a direct relationship

17   between the New York State Smokers Quit Line on the

18   one hand and the tobacco cessation center at Roswell

19   on the other hand, or are those separate programs?

20        A.   No, they're all under my direct control.

21    I run the tobacco research and service delivery

22   programs. I have a program that's being funded now

23   for about eight years where I have nurses that

24   actually go out and train primary care docs how to

25   do -- talk to their patients, identify their 4117

1   patients, the kinds of therapies that work, how to

2   set up follow-up systems, because the initial

3   therapies usually are not going to -- it's a product

4   relapsing problem, so really educating the

5   healthcare professionals. Usually you go and try to

6   get the doctor to agree to have the nurse do it,

7   because it's usually the nurse that ends up running

8   the program. So we have set up systems that way.

9   We set them up in virtually every hospital in the

10   western New York region. I do a lot of training.

11    So a lot of my work is somewhat administrative these

12   days, because I've been able to hire people to sort

13   of deliver the service, but I oversee the services

14   that are -- that are, you know, put out.

15        Q.   And are you still teaching now at the

16   State University of New York at Buffalo?

17        A.   Yes. You know, I have students that are,

18   you know, training under me, so I serve on master's

19   and Ph.D. committees still. I give lectures,

20   usually, probably a half dozen or so. I don't teach

21    a formal course, I gave that up about two years ago.

22   I used to teach the epidemiology course at Cancer

23   Epi Program for about 25 years or so.

24             And then I took over the health behavior

25   course, which was a required one until the 4118

1   university could hire some faculty to run that

2   program. They were sort of building their school of

3   public health and so now I just go in and give the

4   lectures primarily in the area of health

5   communication, health policy, and the area of

6   tobacco control.

7        Q.   Going backwards again for just a moment,

8   you had some teaching responsibilities at Wayne

9   State as well; did you not?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   And also taught at the University of

12   Michigan in the capacity as a research associate?

13        A.   Research, I was a graduate student, so I

14   was a grad assistant teaching. So as most graduate

15   Ph.D. students, they -- in order to earn your keep,

16   they make you teach some courses, which is a good

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=14
17   way to learn how to teach and put a course together,

18   and I enjoy the teaching.

19        Q.   Could you tell the jury, please, about

20   some of your professional affiliations, professional

21    organizations of relevance to the issues that we'll

22   be dealing with here that you've been involved in?

23        A.   Sure. Well, I've been a member of the

24   American Association of Cancer Research, which is

25   big major cancer research organization. The 4119

1   American Society of Preventative Oncology, the

2   Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, the

3   American Public Health Association. Those are some

4   of the, you know, sort of formal organizations that

5   I sort of pay attention to, and they all have

6   journals, so I end up doing reviews of their

7   articles. You know, I've served on editorial

8   boards. I was deputy editor of the

9   Journal of Tobacco Control, which is published by

10   the British Medical Association, so I did that for

11    about eight years.

12        Q.   You have also served on the editorial

13   board of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &

14   Prevention, another professional journal, correct?

15        A.   Yeah, it's a mouthful, but that's the

16   prevention journal for the American Association of

17   Cancer Research.

18        Q.   And that's a position that you held for

19   approximately a dozen years, right?

20        A.   For that position, yeah. I think it was

21    about six or seven years, something like that.

22        Q.   Well, if your C.V. says 1991 to 2003,

23   would that help your recollection?

24        A.   Sure. If you've got my C.V., I don't have

25   it in front of me. 4120

1         Q.   Yes, I do. I'll help you along so we can

2   move this along a little bit. You were an editorial

3   board member of the Health Education Quarterly from

4    1985 to 1994?

5        A.   Right.

6        Q.   And just very briefly, explain to the

7   jurors, if you would, please, the responsibilities

8   that you had as an editorial board member, what did

9   that require you to do?

10        A.   Well, they usually select you because of

11    your expertise, and then the papers that come in in

12   your particular area, often on the editorial board.

13   If you're just on the editorial board, you just get

14   to review a lot more papers, typically. You go to

15   meetings every year and you sort of get to set the

16   agenda for how the theme for the journal coming up

17   for the next year and so on.

18             As a deputy editor, you're actually

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=15
19   selecting the other -- and recommending other

20   reviewers. Every paper that comes in, you're

21    reviewing, and there's usually a two-tiered -- it

22   goes through an editorial, senior editorial review,

23   and then out to the peer review. Usually you select

24   four peer reviewers for every paper, blinded, and

25   then the papers come back and you have to look at 4121

1   the responses, because often they're mixed, and you

2   have to make judgments about what -- you communicate

3   back to the author, it's a reject, it's an accept,

4   or most likely it's a revise and resubmit and where

5   the areas that some of the revisions are going to be

6   required.

7        Q.   You also have served as a reviewer for,

8   according to your professional resume, 16

9   professional journals, including cancer, public

10   health reports, addictive behavior, the American

11    Journal of Public Health, the Journal of the

12   American Medical Association, Lancet, the British

13   Medical Journal, the American Journal of

14   Preventative Medicine, Nicotine and Tobacco

15   Research, among others, correct?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   What has been the primary focus of the

18   responsibilities that you have had when called upon

19   to review submissions of others? Is there a

20   particular area that you have focused those

21    responsibilities in?

22        A.   Well, I have a broad range because of the

23   nature of the research that I've done over the

24   years. I actually have a fairly broad range of

25   areas that I review it. So I've reviewed on tobacco 4122

1    almost exclusively, but tobacco epidemiology, so the

2   effects of tobacco on disease outcomes and the

3   nature of those studies, evaluating the quality of

4   the studies and conclusions that are reached, uptake

5   of tobacco use, cessation of tobacco use, the

6   effects of marketing on tobacco use behavior,

7   cigarette design, and the effect on smoking

8   behavior, biomarkers, new products and how to

9   evaluate them, as well as how to do smoking

10   cessation and, you know, treatments, and so I have

11    got a whole array of different papers and categories

12   of papers. Because of the work that I've done on

13   industry business records and the research that I've

14   done and published on, I typically am called upon to

15   review papers that are done in that area as well.

16        Q.   To what extent do your responsibilities as

17   a reviewer in the areas that you described require

18   you to have a sound historical perspective on the

19   science in the particular area in which you're

20   reviewing, as well as a current knowledge of the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=16
21    state of the science in those areas?

22        A.   Well, I mean, you're selective because of

23   your expertise as a reviewer, and you should have a

24   good background, particularly in the tobacco area of

25   knowing what's been done, and there's a huge 4123

1   literature available. If you go and --

2   organization, the CDC, offset smoking and health

3   puts out the Surgeon General's reports. They

4   actually have a bibliography going back to when they

5   started in '64. They have over 80,000 papers that

6   they cited in their reports.

7        Q.   CDC, Center for Disease Control?

8        A.   That's right. And so --1 mean,

9   obviously, you wouldn't know every detail by 80,000

10   publications, but you should have in the area of --

11    the paper should know that topic and you're

12   reviewing whether the question is relevant, whether

13   the authors that are writing know the literature,

14   and that their question is important, unique, and

15   they're going to contribute something new.

16             I mean, that's what science should be

17   doing through peer review, it's just communicating

18   the observations that are new to the body of

19   literature, and then you draw from that whether it's

20   different, the same. And in science, we're often

21    looking for a replication of the data, because that

22   gives us confidence that the findings are real,

23   reliable, and valid.

24        Q.   You also have a separate section

25   concerning review committees. What is a review 4124

1    committee?

2        A.   Well, review committees are to review the

3   grants. So in order to do the research, you need

4   money, and you write to organizations that have

5   money that fund research. So the biggest funder of

6   research is the National Institutes of Health, and

7   in my area, it's the National Cancer Institute, and

8   they have a peer-review process.

9             So as you write your grants, you send them

10   into the organization and they'll identify experts

11    who will write a critique of your project, and then

12   it will come before a committee and the reviewers

13   actually have to present it in terms of their

14   strengths and weaknesses of the project, the

15   significance of the study, the methods that are

16   proposed, and then the committee votes, each member

17   of the committee votes on the grant, and you're

18   ranked, and it's a highly competitive process.

19             Now, they're funding, I think, at a rate

20   of every hundred grants that come in, maybe eight

21    will get funded. It's about 8 percent. So it's a

22   lot of work to put these grants together, but it's

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=17
23   very similar to the peer-review process that's used

24   in reviewing research papers.

25             So I've served on NIH grant committees, I 4125

1   was just on one last Friday. We do routinely

2   reviews for other organizations, as well as some

3   foundations. The Canadian government, I've done

4   reviews for groups over in Asia, usually by mail,

5   and then they call you up on the phone and you

6   participate in the peer-review process that way. So

7   it's the way science is done, and it's not a perfect

8   system, but it's the best system we have to try to

9   pick out the most meritorious grants and it's the

10   way science sort of operates in this country.

11         Q.   The American Cancer Society has also

12   called upon you to apply your expertise to review

13   grant applications for them; correct?

14        A.   Yes. I served on one of their committees

15   for a number of years and eventually chaired one of

16   their committees, and usually do a stint for five

17   years, then they get tired of you, and you move off

18   and someone else moves on, and that's the way the

19   process operates. It's a good way to learn what's

20   going on in the field, and what's new, what people

21    are thinking. So I always find it challenging.

22   It's a lot of work to do the peer reviews.

23        Q.   Rather than getting tired of you, there

24   have been a fairly significant number of

25   organizations that have honored you with awards, 4126

1   including the American Lung Association, the

2   American Cancer Society, the American Society of

3   Preventative Oncology, the National Heart

4   Foundation, and others, correct?

5        A.   Yeah, my son has told me it's because I'm

6   getting old. So if you're around long enough, they

7   start to give you awards. That's probably a bad

8   sign.

9        Q.   Not postuously?

10        A.   No, fortunately.

11         Q.   You mentioned earlier about the

12   requirement that you managed to generate grant

13   income for the Roswell Institute, and you have been

14   very successful in making grant applications and

15   being awarded many substantial grants, correct?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   I have taken the time to add up the

18   dollars in round numbers. You took the time to

19   number the grants, so we know that there are 57 of

20   them, at least as of the version of this resume that

21    I have, and those grants total well over

22   $40 million.

23             Could you tell us a little bit, please,

24   about the areas in which you have been awarded the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimo^pgNbr=18
25   responsibility for conducting research with other 4127

1   people's money?

2        A.   All right. Well, almost all those grants

3   are on the area of tobacco, and they range from

4   studies to evaluate information campaigns that I've

5   designed and tested. I've done studies on smoking

6   cessation and a range of different therapies for how

7   to help people quit. Large community-based studies

8   where we tracked smokers over many years. We have a

9   study that now has a follow-up of -- it started with

10   20,000 smokers, now follow-up for 17 years, it's the

11    largest single government-funded cohort.

12             I've been sort of the one that has kept

13   that going and we've been studying what factors

14   relate to, you know, how people quit smoking and

15   whether they are able to quit smoking and what the

16   percentages are on an annual basis in quitting and

17   relapse. It's probably the largest source of

18   information on that topic.

19             I have studies going on through a Center

20   of Excellence that was funded by NIH. They funded

21    seven centers that were the top centers in the area

22   of tobacco control research. Ours was focused on

23   the effects of large scale interventions done at

24   national level. You know, pricing increases through

25   taxation, clean indoor air laws, the effects of 4128

1   information delivered through the mass media, and

2   even on cigarette packs, warnings and so on that

3   we've been studying all over the world. I have

4   studies now in 20 countries. We've collected up --

5        Q.   Name some of those countries for us,

6   Doctor.

7        A.   The U.S. is one of them, Canada,

8   Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom,

9   Malaysia, Thailand, China, India, Bhutan, Mauritius,

10   Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico. Those are a few off the

11    top, Germany, France.

12        Q.   I had interrupted you in mid-sentence, and

13   I'm not sure if you can even remember what the end

14   of the sentence was that I interrupted.

15        A.   As well as following smokers in each of

16   these countries, we have about 2,000 smokers that we

17   have been tracking up to eight years in the U.S. and

18   in the other countries, a little bit shorter period

19   of time. We've also been collecting up the leading

20   cigarette brands in the different countries to

21    compare the brands to look at how the products

22   change over time.

23             I run a tobacco testing lab at Roswell

24   Park where we basically back engineer the products

25   to look at how the products are changing, to look at 4129

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=19
1   the design features and how they actually relate to

2   the smoking behavior that we see in the individuals

3   that we're tracking. So how things like the

4   construction of the filter and the use of vent holes

5   and porosity of the paper, the blend. There are a

6   variety of factors that we know influence the

7   exposures that people get and the exposures,

8   obviously, relate ultimately to the health problems

9   that you see.

10             So we have a repository outside the

11    tobacco industry, probably the largest repository of

12   cigarette products collected from all over the

13   world. And we're tracking them literally just like

14   individuals. We go back on a regular basis and

15   we're comparing over time temporarily to see how

16   those products are changing and how that relates to

17   what we see in the cohort of smokers that we're

18   following.

19        Q.   What are some of the kinds of components

20   of cigarettes that you are looking at?

21         A.   We look at the blend -- basically, there

22   are three areas of the product design you look at.

23   The blend of the product, what blends of tobacco

24   that are used, and there are different varieties,

25   and they differ in terms of the content of nicotine, 4130

1   the amount of tar that they will yield in a smoking

2   machine.

3             There's also reconstituted tobacco that's

4   used in products, so not all of it is real. I call

5   it manmade tobacco because it's reconstituted from

6   stems and stalks, often recycled tobacco is used,

7   reused, unsold. They bring it back and reuse it,

8   and there's a process for creating recycling of the

9   product. So blending is one of the features that we

10   look at.

11             We look at additives in the product.

12   There are a lot of additives in different

13   cigarettes, and they vary quite a bit around the

14   world, as does the blend, and that influences the

15   exposures that people get. And the additives are

16   there for a variety of reasons that we've been

17   trying to explore and study and look at in terms of

18   how they affect smoking behavior, anything that

19   affects the pH of the product, how acid or basic it

20   is, ammoniation, use of urea is something that's

21    added in many U.S. cigarettes.

22             So, that's important. And certainly their

23   flavor additives, like menthol is probably most

24   well-known, but there are a variety, chocolate,

25   vanilla, variety of different flavors in cigarettes. 4131

1              And then there are basically what I call

2   engineering design features, which are critical.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=20
3   Probably the most obvious one people forget about

4   today, but used to be that cigarettes didn't have

5   filters on them. Today, most cigarettes have a

6   filter, so that's one engineering change, that's an

7   additive. So the design of that filter is quite

8   complex, there are entire books on the subject. How

9   the filter efficiency works, what the filter

10   material is made out of, whether there are holes

11    that are drilled in the filter. They call them

12   filter vents, that was not always the case. That

13   actually affects a lot how people smoke because it

14   reduces resistance to draw so you can take a bigger,

15   deeper puff, so you draw smoke deeper into your

16   lungs. It sort of gives you the illusion that the

17   smoke is a little lighter, when it's not. You're

18   actually getting the same or even more of an

19   exposure.

20             There's porosity of the paper. Again,

21    recycled cigarettes or the generic cigarettes, they

22   use recycled paper, premium cigarettes, so you're

23   looking at differences in the different cigarette

24   brands and how they differ. We look for metals in

25   the product, cadmium, lead is something we find in 4132

1    Chinese cigarettes because of the air pollution that

2   gets in the soil, they grow it up in the tobacco.

3   It's not only in the toys, it's in the tobacco as

4   well.

5        Q.   Or as in this area, not only in the

6   dry wall?

7        A.   Yeah. It turns out it's one of the things

8   you find in counterfeit cigarettes. So we've been

9   tracking things, counterfeits, contraband, and the

10   tax stamps on the packs. So those three areas, you

11    have blend, additives, and engineering are really

12   the three areas that we sort of do back engineering

13   on.

14             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, may I approach

15        the witness to provide him with some water?

16             THE COURT: Yes.

17        A.   I'm getting hoarse already.

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   I don't know that you're getting hoarse,

20   but I would imagine you might be getting dry or will

21   be before we finish today.

22        A.   Thank you.

23        Q.   How long have you been doing the kind of

24   work that you have just described, focusing on the

25   technical aspects of the construction, design, 4133

1   manufacture of the cigarettes?

2        A.   I got interested in the -- really in the

3   design aspect of cigarettes about 15 years ago. So

4   in the mid-1990s, there were new and unique products

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=21
5   and started doing studies on patents, and so that's

6   really where that focus is, and we're one of the top

7   centers doing it. I mean, I have some really

8   talented people who work for me, so I sort of ride

9   along on their shoulders and have helped. You know,

10   my job now, I'm chair of a department, so I sort

11    of -- you know, I'm there to help bring resources in

12   and set their labs up and let them go at it.

13             In fact, one of our people is now on some

14   of the advisory committees to our government

15   agencies looking at different aspects of cigarette

16   design.

17        Q.   Are you required, in that managerial

18   supervisory position, to remain aware of the details

19   of the work that are going on within the department?

20        A.   Yes. And so I come in in the morning, do

21    a little work. Most of it is paper-pushing during

22   the afternoon, and try to keep the boat floating,

23   make sure there are grants going in, there's

24   resources, things are working. And then in the

25   evening, I go back to the rest of my work and do 4134

1    other things that I enjoy.

2        Q.   Turning to your C.V., you have not only

3   been a reviewer for peer-reviewed journals, you have

4   also, on a few occasions, been a reviewee, that is,

5   you have submitted articles for publication in

6   peer-review journals, which have been accepted for

7   publication?

8        A.   Right.

9        Q.   And in your case, a few means 270

10   peer-review articles which you have authored or

11    coauthored, which have been accepted for publication

12   in respected peer-reviewed journals, correct?

13        A.   That's right. I mean, we're a big

14   research outfit, so you'd expect to have a fair

15   amount of articles coming out. I mean, that's what

16   you're in business to do. Science is not just to do

17   observations and learn things, but it's to

18   communicate those and learn from others, so we've

19   been active in participating in that.

20             So, you know, again, I have been able to

21   build out a good group, and so a lot of those

22   articles I benefit because I've got people who are

23   leading a lot of those studies and I get to

24   participate in some really fascinating research.

25        Q.   And is it true, Dr. Cummings, that the 4135

1   vast majority of those 270 scholarly works relate to

2   areas that are directly relevant to that list of

3   questions that we went through at the very beginning

4   of your appearance here today?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   Now, I'm not sure how current this

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=22
7   particular version of your C.V. is, but it does list

8   270 peer-review articles and an additional 16 more

9   in preparation as of the time of this C.V.

10             So do you continue to remain very actively

11    involved in the publication of scholarly works?

12        A.   Yes, you have to. I mean, otherwise you'd

13   retire. So, I mean, it's what we do. Writing the

14   papers is really the fun part of doing the science.

15   So you organize it and you learn, and it forces you

16   to very concisely take what you think you've learned

17   from the studies that you've done and place that in

18   the context of the literature that's out there, and

19   there's huge literature in the tobacco area.

20             So that's --1 continue to do that. I

21    don't know when that C.V. was, but it's something

22   that anybody at a cancer research institute, that's

23   our business is to do research.

24        Q.   That's the fun part of the job.

25        A.   Well, writing it is the end of all that 4136

1   time and energy from thinking of an idea, begging

2   somebody for money, and convincing them that you

3   have got a meritorious project to, you know, doing

4   the data collection, which is really the attention

5   to detail of the work that's required, and then

6   writing it up is -- yeah, if you're still standing

7   at the end of the process, that's the fun part.

8        Q.   You and we may have a different idea about

9   what fun is.

10             In addition to publishing those scholarly

11   papers, you have authored 25 chapters in a variety

12   of publications, correct?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And you have published commentaries and

15   editorials in a variety of respected journals and

16   letters to the editor and technical reports. But I

17   want to get into another area that had been a

18   significant focus of your work, but first tell us

19   how it is that tobacco work has attracted your

20   attention and dedication to the degree that it has,

21   based upon what you have described to us so far?

22        A.   Sure. Well, it wasn't really something I

23   was trained to do in my graduate training. I

24   arrived at Roswell Park. Roswell Park is a

25   dedicated cancer center, and a third of the patients 4137

1    are there because of smoking. A third of all

2   cancers are caused by smoking.

3             So, running the clinics. And really I

4   learned, I got interested because of the struggles

5   that I saw people having quitting smoking, and why

6   didn't they just quit when we gave them the

7   information on how dangerous this product is. Here

8   they are coming to a cancer center to go to a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=23
9   clinic.

10             And the process that they had, the

11    struggles, the withdrawal that they experienced,

12   weight gain, the pattern of their smoking and who

13   was able to quit and who wasn't, these were all very

14   interesting questions, and I didn't have a lot of

15   answers. There wasn't a lot of good answers in the

16   literature, frankly.

17             So that's sort of the way my research

18   really was drawn and still is to a large degree,

19   which is why I like doing the clinical work because

20   I learn from the people who are coming for help, I

21    mean, really struggling to stop smoking.

22             And then, of course, you have the business

23   of quitting smoking has evolved with new therapies,

24   not a lot, but there are the nicotine replacement

25   therapies that came along, '84 I think the gum came 4138

1    on the market, and then the patch in the early 1990s

2   and some of the other therapies, they have one

3   over-the-counter, and what effect did that have.

4             So it was really drawn out of the obvious

5   issue, if you work at a cancer center, and that's

6   why I got involved in doing tobacco research, it

7   just seemed so obvious, if you want to be in cancer

8   prevention, you ought to be doing something in

9   tobacco control.

10             So that's sort of how my career evolved,

11    and I was fortunate to get grants to support some of

12   the things that we're doing. It's been very

13   interesting, and has culminated, frankly, in the

14   late '90s receiving millions of pages of business

15   records from the tobacco companies because two of

16   the affiliated organizations, The Tobacco Institute

17   and the Council for Tobacco Research were -- those

18   documents were turned over to the state attorney

19   general, and the attorney general's office called me

20   and said, "Would you like these materials?"

21              I foolishly said yes. And they arrived in

22   pallets every two weeks for five years. I hired and

23   learned a lot about library science because I hired

24   somebody that knew how to digitize material. I

25   hired about 16 librarians to come in and teach me 4139

1   how to index things so we could actually search the

2   materials in a logical way.

3             So that was the last ten years of my work,

4   and that was a new source of information. The

5   business records not only that came to Roswell, but

6   were put up online, became a real way of

7   understanding and validating some of the work that

8   we had been doing over the last, you know, before

9   then, 20 years on people's smoking behavior. I

10   mean, if you're in the health behavior area, tobacco

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=24
11    is a very interesting behavior to study.

12        Q.   You told us that these documents came to

13   you from the attorney general. What was the

14   original source of the documents? What kind of

15   documents are we talking about? Where did they come

16   from initially?

17        A.   Well, they came from two organizations.

18   The ones that came to Roswell were the documents

19   that were housed at the Tobacco Institute, which is

20   an organization that was funded by the major

21    cigarette manufacturers. The Tobacco Institute was

22   incorporated in 1958.

23             There was another organization also

24   incorporated by the tobacco industry which was

25   called the Council for Tobacco Research. Prior to 4140

1   that, it was called the Tobacco Industry Research

2   Committee. That organization was actually

3   incorporated in 1954.

4        Q.   Is that sometimes referred to as TIRC?

5        A.   TIRC. And then they became council --

6   they changed their name essentially after the

7   Surgeon General's report came out in 1964. Two

8   months later, they changed their name. They didn't

9   want the Tobacco Institute. They changed it to

10   Council for Tobacco Research. It's the same

11    organization.

12             So all those documents and those

13   organizations, as a result of an agreement between

14   the companies and state attorney generals, which

15   happened in 1998, went out of business. So their

16   materials got turned over to New York State. The

17   New York State archives collected them and then they

18   were sent to Roswell where we could digitize them so

19   they could be organized and people could look at the

20   materials. Because they were quite relevant to

21    understanding the research that was funded by the

22   tobacco companies, as well as their public

23   statements made over literally a 50-year period on

24   behalf of the cigarette manufacturers, because, in

25   fact, that's what the Tobacco Institute was. It was 4141

1    an organization that was set up to do -- basically

2   to speak on behalf of the tobacco companies on

3   matters related to smoking and health.

4        Q.   So these were actually tobacco industry

5   internal business records?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   And describe to us, please, the volume of

8   material that you received and were responsible to

9   begin to organize, catalog and analyze.

10        A.   Well, it was a large volume. 16 million

11    was the total amount that we ended up digitizing.

12   In addition, there were 3,000 audio and videotapes

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=25
13   that came along of varying lengths.

14             The Tobacco Institute basically tracked

15   almost every public statement ever made about

16   smoking, so they had this huge repository of

17   material and certainly kept track of all the

18   statements made by their spokespeople. So we

19   digitized that information as well.

20        Q.   So you had audiotapes, videotapes, and

21   print statements of people within the tobacco

22   industry spanning a long period of time?

23        A.   Yeah, about 50 years.

24        Q.   And what about internal communications

25   among tobacco executives, were they included in 4142

1   these documents?

2        A.   They were, because these were

3   organizations that were not only funded by the

4   cigarette manufacturers, they were -- the executive

5   committees were the heads of the companies

6   essentially. There was basically an ad hoc

7   committee of -- usually made up of the chief general

8   councils of each of the companies that would meet on

9   a much more frequent basis. They pretty much set

10   the policy for these organizations. They did the

11    hiring. They really oversaw all the budgets and the

12   policies.

13             And so the direction that these

14   organizations went in, they certainly oversaw every

15   communication that went out of those organizations.

16   That's why the messaging is very consistent over the

17   period that I studied in terms of issues related to

18   smoking and health, marketing to youth. I mean,

19   there's a whole variety of others, nicotine

20   addiction.

21              There was a constant message that came out

22   on behalf of the companies by their essentially

23   public relations organization that was funded at

24   millions and millions of dollars. It grew from a

25   few people in 1958, it was a huge organization, 4143

1    about 50 or 60 people all pretty much operating in

2   public relations by 1970.

3        Q.   What about advertising and marketing

4   materials, are they included within the scope of the

5   documents that you have collected, cataloged and

6   analyzed?

7        A.   Yes. I collected -- well, the Tobacco

8   Institute collected their issue types of marketing

9   ads and so on. So they're not brand advertising.

10             And I have a separate collection of --

11    that I created, that I actually acquired from a

12   marketing professor, Rick Pollay from Vancouver, he

13   had collected a little over 8,000 different examples

14   of cigarette ads dating back to the 1920s going

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=26
15   forward.

16             And during the period from the '50s, '60s,

17   when you had TV advertising and radio advertising, I

18   also acquired about 700 cigarette ads that had

19   appeared on television. Those we put up online.

20   This has all gone digital these days. So we've

21    created libraries now that are literally online.

22        Q.   How and when did your very busy schedule

23   and obviously significant responsibilities first

24   begin to be interrupted by involvement in

25   litigation? 4144

1        A.   Well, I was asked -- the first case that I

2   was asked to participate in had to do with state

3   attorney generals, which was in probably 1996, '97.

4   I think those were going forward. There were a

5   couple of state cases that I was asked to

6   participate in, largely because some of the research

7   that I had done.

8             I had participated in an Institute of

9   Medicine report on nicotine addiction in children,

10   and that report -- a number of people who had

11    contributed to that report were -- got involved in

12   asking the -- actually served initially as

13   consultants to the attorneys, and then that ended up

14   doing depositions, and then later I was asked to

15   participate in a case down here in Florida that went

16   on with flight attendants, actually on the issue of

17   secondhand smoke. I had done a number of studies on

18   air monitoring and secondhand smoke effects. That

19   was a case down here. And then there was another

20   large class action case that I was involved with

21    here.

22        Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, can you tell us,

23   please, in terms of percentage of your income, how

24   much of your income is derived from work involving

25   litigation consulting? 4145

1        A.   Since I started?

2        Q.   Yes, an overview if you would, please.

3        A.   Sure. Well, since I started, it's about 5

4   or 10 percent. I mean, there have been -- early on

5   I did a lot of cases pro bono, didn't get paid, just

6   come and, you know, do the case.

7        Q.   Why?

8        A.   And -- well, I had unique expertise, and

9   it's very expensive to do these cases, and I was

10   asked to come in and just share. And I thought it

11    was a privilege actually to come in and share what I

12   knew. And it was -- essentially, when I got started

13   doing it I thought it would be a one-time thing, so

14   it's not a big deal, a couple of days from work, not

15   much of a problem. I'll take those as vacation, I'm

16   here on vacation today.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=27
17             And then it got more and more and more,

18   and so over time -- you know, overall, it's about 5

19   or 10 percent, that's why I asked the time. In the

20   last year I've been very busy, and it's probably a

21    little bit closer to 20 percent of my time. And

22   because it is a bigger chunk of my time, I do charge

23   now for coming in to do the cases.

24        Q.   As we know. And could you tell us,

25   please, the rate at which you are charging for your 4146

1    services in this case?

2        A.   For deposition and trial testimony, I

3   charge $300 an hour, and for outside work, so the

4   review of all the materials and putting together the

5   materials I brought with me for presenting to you,

6   that's $100 an hour. So that's pretty much my

7   consulting fee that I do for anybody. And half of

8   those fees go back to Roswell Park.

9        Q.   Now, you arrived here late yesterday

10   afternoon for purposes of being available to give

11    your testimony in this case, correct?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   And you and I spent about seven hours

14   together last night?

15        A.   We did.

16        Q.   And can you please, including that time

17   and the time that you have spent up until about 3:15

18   this afternoon, give us a general estimate as to how

19   much time you have spent from the beginning of your

20   involvement in this case to now, ballpark figure?

21         A.   Ballpark, I would say probably about 35

22   hours, probably outside, and then, you know, there's

23   a deposition that I did that went over multiple

24   days. So that was --1 don't know whether that

25   added up to about 12 hours or so of deposition time. 4147

1         Q.   Okay. And this is not the first or only

2   case in which we have asked for your assistance on

3   behalf of clients represented by our law firm, is

4   it?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   Can you tell us, tell the ladies and

7   gentlemen of the jury, please, how many other cases

8   you have been involved in assisting our law firm?

9        A.   I think this is the fourth case that I

10   think I've done for your law firm.

11         Q.   All right, Dr. Cummings, thank you.

12             In addition to the general background,

13   experience, training, formal education that you have

14   described to us, was it necessary for you to do

15   case-specific work relating to the claim that Liz

16   Piendle has brought on behalf of the estate of her

17   deceased husband Charlie, that is, did you study

18   documents that relate particularly to this case?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=28
19        A.   I did.

20        Q.   Could you give the jury, and it's not

21    necessary at least at this point for you to detail

22   everything, but an overview, a general description

23   of the nature of the materials that you reviewed in

24   this matter in order to be able to express the

25   opinions that we are going to ask you to testify to 4148

1   today?

2        A.   Sure. I reviewed, you know, essentially

3   three sets of materials. Medical records. I

4   reviewed a number of depositions that were taken of

5   family members and friends of the family, or friends

6   who knew Mr. Piendle. And I also reviewed

7   interrogatories that were prepared, also referred to

8   as worksheets in some places in Florida, but they

9   basically give you a background on, you know, the

10   plaintiffs.

11         Q.   Did you, in addition, review medical

12   records relating to Charlie Piendle?

13        A.   I did.

14        Q.   All right, sir.

15             You have talked about your publications

16   generally and related them to the general areas in

17   which we are going to be talking to you, but have

18   you published specifically in the area of addiction

19   and cessation of tobacco use?

20        A.   Yes. Quite a bit. That's, I would say,

21    the major area I have published in. We have a whole

22   monograph coming out in nicotine and tobacco

23   research devoted to that topic that's come out of

24   the work that we've done in the different countries.

25   We're comparing quitting behavior across 15 4149

1    different countries in this particular issue of

2   nicotine and tobacco research.

3        Q.   Has your research in publishing also

4   focused specifically on youth initiation of smoking

5   and addiction?

6        A.   It is, it has. I received a fairly large

7   NIH grant in the late 1990s to study the business

8   records that had become available at that time from

9   the industry online to assess, you know, basically

10   test the hypothesis that the companies said they

11    don't market to kids, and so looked at their

12   business records in that regard.

13             And have also done my own studies. I've

14   done several large studies of high school and junior

15   high students over the years, actually back into the

16    1980s, and I've got a group, we survey every ninth

17   grader essentially in Erie County, New York. We've

18   been doing this since 1991. We do it every four

19   years as a sort of barometer of what's going on and

20   look at their brand use, a whole variety of things

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=29
21    related to tobacco, the kinds of products they're

22   using, as well as other drug use behavior.

23             So this is a service that we sort of

24   created back in the 1990s, and had done some other

25   research in the '80s that sort of led up to doing 4150

1   that. That's ongoing.

2             And I actually have a study right now

3   where we're, with Yale University, where we're

4   testing out an incentive-based program as a way to

5   discourage uptake of smoking among high school

6   students.

7        Q.   Describe that to us. What kind of bribes

8   are you offering?

9        A.   Money. Money seems to be a good bribe.

10   And it's basically a pledge-type program. It's

11    called Rise Above. We actually developed it with

12   the students in the school. They market it

13   themselves.

14             Essentially the concept is reinforcing the

15   idea of making the choice not to smoke. So if

16   you're a smoker, you can still make that choice, so

17   you can get in the program as long as you're willing

18   to make that choice, and then there are literally

19   weekly drawings that were done where people could

20   basically win $25, $50 gift certificates on a random

21   basis, and you had to be drug-tested in order to

22   validate that you hadn't been exposed to nicotine.

23             And we did this in two schools, one in

24   Western New York and another in New Haven in

25   Connecticut, and are evaluating how many kids signed 4151

1   up and what the reaction was. We did smokers and

2   nonsmokers to see how they were responding.

3             It worked pretty well, actually. It's

4   still too early, we're in the midst of doing the

5   study, but we've got a lot of participation, about

6   75 percent of the kids signed up for the program,

7   and a number of the smokers said they quit.

8        Q.   Have you worked on Surgeon General's

9   reports in the past in the area of your expertise

10   relating to tobacco use, addiction, cessation,

11    relapse?

12        A.   Yeah. I started doing Surgeon General's

13   reports in 1988. I was a reviewer on the addiction

14   report. I was a contributor. I have been a

15   contributor to a number of the reports. The

16   '89 report was on the 25-year anniversary of the

17   original Surgeon General's report. And I did the

18   section sort of reviewing the history of smoking

19   cessation methods that are contained in that huge

20   document. And I've done a number of others.

21              And I've also consulted with the Office on

22   Smoking and Health that is mandated to put out these

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=30
23   reports on what topics. They usually bring together

24   experts to give them advice on what the topics are

25   for the next year's report. I've done reviews. I'm 4152

1   reviewing -- you can do chapter reviews or you can

2   get the whole reports, I've done both.

3             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I am about to

4        move into another area.

5             THE COURT: Okay.

6             MR. SCAROLA: If the Court thinks this is

7        a good time for an afternoon recess.

8             THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

9        we'll take our mid-afternoon break and be in

10        recess for 15 minutes. So we'll be back at 20

11         minutes to 4:00.

12             Please remember the important instruction

13        not to discuss the case with anyone or have any

14        interaction with anyone associated with the

15        case.

16             And I remind our witness that you are

17        still under oath, and you are not discuss the

18        case with anyone.

19             And see you back at 20 minutes to 4:00.

20        Thank you.

21              (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

22        after which the following proceedings were

23        held:)

24             MR. KELLY: I'm sure you want to take a

25        break, your Honor, at one point. Could we have 4153

1        marked with an exhibit number and attached to

2        the record the two or three sheets of

3        questions?

4             THE COURT: Yes.

5             MR. KELLY: May I?

6             MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to need them

7        again. But yes, I have no problem with

8        marking.

9             MR. KELLY: Let's mark them. Let's give

10        them an exhibit number.

11              THE CLERK: HH.

12             MR. KELLY: HH-1, HH-2, and HH-3. Is that

13        all right? I'll be happy to mark them.

14             And would the record reflect, your Honor,

15        that the series of objections that we made at

16        sidebar were denied?

17             THE COURT: That's correct, they were

18        denied insofar as counsel for plaintiff was

19        permitted to use them as demonstrative to

20        establish the background of the witness without

21        prejudice to the defense to raise any

22        objections to any substantive opinions that the

23        witness may give on any of these topics.

24             MR. KELLY: Including cumulative when we

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=31
25        get to the individual topics? 4154

1              THE COURT: Correct.

2             MR. KELLY: Thank you. I wanted to make

3        sure that I can still continue to raise the

4        cumulative objections as they come up as we

5        move through the topics.

6             THE COURT: Yes, no substantive objections

7        were denied.

8             MS. KESSLER: May I approach the bench?

9             THE COURT: Yes.

10             MS. KESSLER: I just want to provide our

11         motion for mistrial that we made orally

12        yesterday. We have provided it in writing and

13        have attached the transcript for your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

15             So recess until 20 of?

16             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, may I take HH

17        for purposes of photocopying, and I'll deliver

18        it back to Gina in just a few minutes?

19             THE COURT: Yes.

20             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much.

21              (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

22        3:27 p.m. until 3:45 p.m., after which the

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   Dr. Cummings, having the description of

12   your education, background, and training and

13   experience, we're going to get into some questions

14   that relate to issues involved in this litigation,

15   and I want you to understand that if I ask you a

16   question which you consider to be outside of your

17   area of expertise, you should, obviously, tell us

18   that, and we will assume that if you answer a

19   question, you are answering that question based upon

20   an opinion that you hold to a reasonable degree of

21    certainty within your area of expertise. Do you

22   understand that?

23        A.   Sure, yes.

24        Q.   Okay. I'm not going to preface each

25   question by saying, "Do you have an opinion to a 4156

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=32
1   reasonable degree of scientific certainty within

2   your area of expertise," but you will assume that

3   that's really a predicate to every question I'm

4   going to ask you. Okay?

5        A.   That's acceptable.

6        Q.   We'll try to save a little bit of time by

7   following that procedure. So I want to begin by

8   asking you, what effect does it have on a smoker's

9   conscious awareness of the dangers of smoking to be

10   able to smoke hundreds or thousands of cigarettes

11    without experiencing any negative feedback while

12   he's smoking or she is smoking those initial

13   hundreds or even thousands of cigarettes?

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, foundation.

15             THE COURT: Overruled. The witness can

16        answer, if he can.

17        A.   The effect would be that it would cause

18   the individual to basically discount the health

19   concerns related to smoking, and this is frequently

20   seen in my research when I look at younger

21    individuals who were smoking, not being particularly

22   concerned about health risks, but as they get older

23   and they begin to notice some of the effects of

24   smoking, they get more concerned and the effects on

25   cessation is there as well. We find little greater 4157

1    success as people get older quitting, versus

2   somebody who's younger who's trying to quit.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   Are there important distinctions about

5   what was considered smart and sexy and stylish and

6   trustworthy and enviable and desirable back in the

7    1950s and 1960s, as compared to what we would

8   consider to be smart and sexy and stylish and

9   trustworthy and enviable and desirable today?

10        A.   Yes. I mean, clearly, cigarette smoking

11   back 50, 60 years ago was the norm, everybody was

12   doing it. In the age group for Mr. Piendle, he

13   basically was -- about seven out of ten males were

14   smokers. So it would have been the exception not to

15   have become a smoker. The prevalence of smoking

16   among people of his age group and, you know, even as

17   teenagers was close to 70 percent among seniors in

18   high school in the late 1950s. So -- among males,

19   it was lower among females. So -- and it was the

20   prevailing thing. It was on television. You had

21    athletes, you had movie stars, TV personalities,

22   doctors, men of science, cigarette advertising was

23   everywhere, it was --

24             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'm sorry to

25        interrupt Dr. Cummings, but this goes far 4158

1        beyond the question. The question was a very

2        broad one. I'm going to have to start

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=33
3        objecting if the broad questions are going to

4        get a lecture every time. Move to strike as

5        nonresponsive to the last statement concerning

6        advertising and sports figure being beyond the

7        scope of the question.

8             THE COURT: I'm going to deny the motion

9        to strike and remind the witness, to the best

10        of your ability, answer each question, and if

11         it's an answer that calls for an explanation,

12        to give the explanation to the question

13        pending.

14             THE WITNESS: I'll do that.

15     BY MR. SCAROLA:

16        Q.   Next question, Dr. Cummings. How

17   important is it not to slip into viewing Charlie

18   Piendle's actions in the 1950s and 1960s through the

19   lens of our own current perspective today --

20        A.   It's  -

21         Q.   -- in expressing opinions about Charlie

22   Piendle's actions with respect to smoking?

23        A.   It's very important to do that, and I

24   certainly did that when I went back and looked at

25   the array of material that I studied in this case 4159

1    and went back and looked at examples of things that

2   were going on at the time he started to smoke and at

3   different time periods during his smoking history.

4        Q.   Charlie Piendle, obviously, is deceased.

5   Charlie has been dead, as of this past week, for 14

6   years. Without the availability of any direct

7   statements from Charlie as to why he started to

8   smoke, is there available evidence from which

9   persons, such as you, with the expertise that you

10   have, can identify the most likely causes of

11    Charlie's smoking?

12             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor, that

13        would call for speculation with respect to

14        Mr. Piendle based on no foundation whatsoever.

15             THE COURT: I'll overrule.

16             The witness can answer, if you can.

17        A.   Yes. It's part of the research that I've

18   done to look at different age cohorts and the things

19   that influence them as they were at their particular

20   time, so you have to have context to understand

21   behavior.

22     BY MR. SCAROLA:

23        Q.   Describe, for the benefit of the jurors,

24   if you would, please, in general terms at this

25   point, the kind of evidence that it was necessary 4160

1   for you to examine in order to arrive at an opinion

2   about influences exerted on Charlie back in the

3    1950s, when Charlie was in grammar school or in

4   early years of high school?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=34
5        A.   Sure. I looked at the deposition

6   testimony from friends and family members that

7   described his uptake of smoking, at what age he

8   became a smoker, the circumstances around his

9   smoking, the brands that he smoked were particularly

10   relevant because I looked at that in the context of

11    the research that I've done on the history of brands

12   that were popular with people of his age group as

13   they aged.

14             And so I looked at the business records

15   from the companies in relationship -- done at

16   various time periods when he started smoking, as

17   well as looking at the testimony from family and

18   friends, and also looked at the medical records as a

19   way of validating the smoking behavior at the

20   approximate time when he began smoking.

21         Q.   Did that evidence enable you to form an

22   opinion about who and what influenced Charlie

23   Piendle to begin smoking back when he was somewhere

24   between 13 and 15 years of age?

25        A.   Yes. 4161

1         Q.   What is the source of the strongest

2   influence on Charlie that caused him to begin to

3   smoke in grammar school and high school?

4             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. No

5        foundation and calls for speculation based upon

6        the foundation laid so far.

7             THE COURT: Have counsel approach.

8             MR. KELLY: Sure.

9             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

10        held out of the presence of the jury:)

11              THE COURT: As I understand your

12        objection, your objection is I think you said

13        speculative or no foundation. This witness

14        doesn't have knowledge specifically as to what,

15        in this instance, this question -- what was the

16        major contributor or influence on Charlie

17        Piendle, correct? Is that correct?

18             MR. KELLY: Yes, that's correct.

19             THE COURT: And as I understand

20        plaintiffs position, you're not taking the

21        position that this witness knows or spoke with

22        or had direct evidence from Charlie Piendle,

23        but based on overall study of cohorts, persons

24        at that time and that age and what was

25        happening in the marketplace that he can draw 4162

1         certain conclusions; is that correct?

2             MR. SCAROLA: That's exactly correct.

3             MR. KELLY: Go ahead.

4             MR. SCAROLA: He has examined all of the

5        relevant documents with regard to Mr. Piendle.

6             MR. KELLY: He has not described for the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=35
7        Court what the influences on Mr. Piendle were

8        back in the '50s that he's identified, nor has

9        he identified for the Court the research he's

10        relying upon regarding brand preferences in the

11         1950s.

12             When he describes Mr. Piendle's cohort, he

13        says these are things he looked at, but he

14        hasn't said what they actually are, how he

15        analyzed that to allow you to assess whether

16        it's speculative or foundation. Right now,

17        it's speculative, there is no foundation.

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Even as to the cohort,

19        never mind Mr. Piendle.

20             MR. SCAROLA: The Evidence Code,

21         Section 90.704, allows a witness -- an expert

22        witness to express an opinion based upon facts

23        that were made known to him during or before

24        trial as long as they are the kinds of

25        materials that are customarily relied upon by 4163

1        that expert within his area of expertise.

2             THE COURT: I understand. I guess the

3        only point I want to make, first of all, I want

4        to make sure you ask the question, it's clear

5        maybe to all of us that they are asked in a way

6        that distinguishes when he's referring to

7        Mr. Piendle through something he may have

8        learned through trial, otherwise as compared to

9        research, and address Mr. Kelly's question that

10        prior to getting him to give the opinion about

11         the influences, just maybe laying the

12        foundation or predicate for what is the

13        influence, for example, and did that apply to

14        the cohort with which --

15             MR. KELLY: The influences for Mr. Piendle

16        based on what he's learned from counsel so we

17        can connect those to whatever his research is.

18             THE COURT: Right.

19             MR. KELLY: That he's relying upon for his

20        connection. There's lack of connection there.

21              THE COURT: I'm allowing the questions. I

22        want the clarification when it's Mr. Piendle

23        and foundation for the question that calls for

24        that opinion. 25

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Dr. Cummings, just so that we are clear,

6   and before we get back to the question that I just

7   asked, you never had the opportunity to meet Charlie

8   Piendle, correct?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   You have not read anything that Charlie

11    Piendle wrote, correct?

12        A.   That's correct.

13        Q.   Haven't listened to any recordings that

14   Charlie Piendle made, correct?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   And there is no witness who has ever told

17   you that Charlie Piendle told that person, this is

18   what influenced me to start smoking, correct?

19        A.   That's correct.

20        Q.   So the opinion that you are about to share

21    with the ladies and gentlemen of the jury is an

22   opinion based upon matters that do not rely upon

23   information obtained either directly or indirectly

24   from Charlie Piendle because no such information was

25   available, correct? 4165

1        A.   That's correct.

2        Q.   Okay. Understanding that it was necessary

3   for you to rely upon other sources to draw your

4   conclusion, you have formed an opinion to a

5   reasonable degree of certainty within your area of

6   expertise as to what the primary -- the source of

7   the primary influence on Charlie Piendle was when he

8   began to smoke; is that correct?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   Would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of

11    the jury, please, what that source was?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Same objection,

13        your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Sustained only insofar as,

15        perhaps, asking the witness as to how he did

16        that, to then ask what the source was.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Could you describe to the ladies and

19   gentlemen of the jury in general terms, again,

20   please, because we're not going to get into the

21    documents right now, could you describe to them how

22   you went about identifying that primary source of

23   influence on Charlie?

24        A.   Well, I -- in reviewing the records, I

25   read the testimony of family members and friends 4166

1   that described his brand history and usage patterns,

2   when he started to smoke, what brands he was smoking

3   at certain times, and have looked at this in

4   relationship to studies that I've done on what the

5   most popular brands were related to smoking, and my

6   research on the factors that have driven young

7   people to start smoking over years, which -- it was

8   the combination of my personal research, my review

9   of the published research as well as the internal

10   business records of the companies, and my review of

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=37
11    the deposition testimony specifically related to the

12   age he started to smoke and the brands that he was

13   smoking.

14        Q.   Are the factors that influence young

15   people to begin to smoke matters that have been the

16   subject not only of your own research but the

17   research of many others as well?

18        A.   Yes. It's well-reviewed in the published

19   literature, I have contributed to that peer-reviewed

20   literature, an entire report of the Surgeon General

21    of the United States in 1994 was devoted to that, I

22   was a participant in writing that report, the

23   Institute of Medicine report dealt at an extreme

24   length at the factors that influence uptake of

25   smoking among young people and summarized that 4167

1   literature, I was a member of that committee that

2   prepared that report in 1994.

3        Q.   What is the source of the strongest

4   influence on Charlie that caused him to begin to

5   smoke in grammar school?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: Object to "on Charlie."

7             THE COURT: Overruled. Predicate has been

8        laid.

9        A.   Well, there are a number of forces that

10   come together, and certainly peer pressure is a

11    factor, is an important factor, what your friends

12   are doing and what brands they're smoking.

13             And overlaying that is the information

14   environment that exists largely driven by cigarette

15   advertising and the brands that are being promoted,

16   because it's not a mistake that kids tend to go to

17   the most popular brands, particularly the brands

18   that their friends smoke, and that is why looking at

19   the business records is so critical because it helps

20   explain at different periods of time, when you track

21    the smoking behavior of young people and that uptake

22   process, how many people are smoking, what brands

23   they're smoking and how that changes over time.

24             And that, by the way, helps you explain

25   down the line a lot about the epidemiology of 4168

1   tobacco use and the diseases that come from it.

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   What do we mean when we talk about a

4   cohort, what is that?

5        A.   A cohort is when you start with -- when I

6   say age cohort, take everyone who was born, say,

7   between 1940 and 1944, and you would follow that age

8   group, because they have different experiences

9   growing up because things change, versus an age

10   cohort that might be born in 1970. Television was

11    here.  1940s, things were a lot different.

12             As you grow up, whether your parents were

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=38
13   smokers, whether the information environment, what

14   was known about the risks of smoking, where you

15   could smoke, was what was on television, advertising

16   of cigarettes was -- cigarette companies were among

17   the most frequent advertisers on cigarettes in the

18    1950s and 1960s. That ended in 1970.

19             So people born after 1970 didn't see brand

20   advertising deliberately put on television and

21    radio. I mean, it got on through racecars and other

22   posters or billboards and sports stadiums, but for

23   the most part it wasn't regular cigarette

24   advertising that you were seeing on television. So

25   that makes a big difference. And again, it made a 4169

1   big difference in which brands turned out to be the

2   most popular ones.

3        Q.   So in the context of what we're talking

4   about here, when we talk about Charlie Piendle's age

5   cohort, we are talking about people in the same age

6   group as Charlie. Cohort in this context means

7   group, right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   What were tobacco companies doing in the

10    1950s, while Charlie Piendle was a teenager, to

11    influence Charlie's age cohort, to have an influence

12   on the peer pressure to which Charlie was going to

13   be subjected?

14             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. It

15        calls for interpretation in violation of the in

16        limine ruling, and there's no foundation.

17             THE COURT: Overruled.

18        A.   They were basically designing their

19   advertising themes, they were designing their

20   products, they were placing their products

21    specifically to go after the groups that they needed

22   to recruit in order to gain market share.

23             And what they knew was in order to be

24   successful as a company, that they needed to capture

25   the first usual brand, which typically occurs during 4170

1   the teenage years because that's when people begin

2   to smoke, and that the companies that were first to

3   get people to try their brand, in other words,

4   buying their brand, were the ones that ultimately

5   were going to be successful because there was high

6   brand loyalty.

7             So there was a great effort to study the

8   smoking behavior of teenagers and young adults,

9   college students as well, to look at which brands

10   were being successful, to design the product

11    specifically so they would appeal to young people.

12   So what they would refer to as a prelearner or a

13   learner in smoking, someone who has not been

14   introduced to it. You have to acquire smoking.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=39
15             So there are features of a product that,

16   you know, are adversive to somebody just starting

17   out, a product that's very strong, harsh and

18   irritating is not one that's particularly attractive

19   to a young person. So putting filters on, reducing

20   the heat that you get from a cigarette when you puff

21    it. You get less tobacco in your mouth with a

22   filter. So a filter tended to be something that was

23   very attractive to young people, particularly in the

24   early 1950s.

25             The blend of tobacco was an important 4171

1   feature in attracting young people as well, and that

2   has evolved over time, but the same basic

3   principles. Design the product to meet the needs,

4   wants and desires of your target audience, and

5   deliver that product message through promotions in

6   places that are convenient where your target

7   audience is going to see it.

8             And certainly in the 1950s, that was done,

9   that was done in the 1960s and the 1970s, and my

10   research says it's gone on even to today.

11              MR. KELLY: Move to strike as

12        nonresponsive with respect to anything beyond

13        the 1950s, which I think was the focus of the

14        original question, and move to strike all of

15        the opinion testimony from Dr. Cummings

16        concerning what companies in the 1950s thought,

17        intended or attempted to do.

18             I believe, your Honor, that might have

19        been before Dr. Cummings was born, or close

20        thereto.

21              THE COURT: Any response?

22             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor.

23             MR. KELLY: Not merely because it was

24        before he was born, but it's all speculation.

25        It violates your in limine ruling against 4172

1        interpreting documents.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I think these

3        sorts of objections should be entertained at

4        sidebar.

5             THE COURT: Okay. Counsel can approach.

6             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

7        held out of the presence of the jury:)

8             THE COURT: Okay. First of all, I don't

9        find that anything that the witness has said

10        violates the in limine ruling with respect to

11         interpretation of documents. An expert can

12        take documents and a compilation of documents

13        and put them in a context and explain them in a

14        way a jury can understand by historical and

15        otherwise. So that is what I believe this

16        witness has done. So I don't find that it

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=40
17        violates the order on that issue.

18             Secondly, you know, it's broken down into

19        two different areas, youth marketing when

20        Mr. Piendle is a youth is one thing, and then

21         youth marketing when Mr. Piendle is not a youth

22        is another thing. I have concluded, you know,

23        based on my ruling, and I needed to wait to see

24        what the evidence was with respect to whether

25        he was smoking as a youth, because it isn't 4173

1         actually entirely clear from submissions that

2        he was.

3             So youth marketing is relevant. So any

4        evidence of youth marketing during the time

5        that Mr. Piendle is a youth is relevant for

6        purposes of, among other things, any alleged

7        harm and influence it had on Mr. Piendle.

8             If we get beyond when Mr. Piendle was a

9        youth, I find that the nexus is there because

10        of the fact there's youth marketing to him as a

11         youth, and that's when the Williams instruction

12        would come in.

13             And I would again suggest counsel let this

14        Court know when it wants the Court to give, if

15        you would, the Williams instruction, or what I

16        would call limiting instructions. Certain

17        evidence can be heard for certain reasons, that

18        is, harm to Mr. Piendle, and other evidence is

19        heard for other things, punitive damages

20        consistent with language. That's the Court's

21         ruling.

22             MR. KELLY: Let me make sure you

23        understand what's going on here. There is no

24        foundation being laid before these opinion

25        questions are being asked, and what your Honor 4174

1        would find out if foundation were required to

2        be laid, that there are no documents from the

3         1950s that would support this opinion, none

4        whatsoever. What he's relying upon are

5        documents in the '80s and beyond and

6        extrapolating.

7             THE COURT: When you say "documents," you

8        mean advertisements?

9             MR. KELLY: Company documents that would

10        show the intent and meaning of the company in

11         the '40s and '50s. There aren't any of those

12        that he relies on there.

13             MR. SALES: I interpreted his testimony

14        primarily to be the kind of advertising going

15        on in the '50s and '60s would be the type of

16        advertising and type of cigarettes Piendle was

17        smoking that would have an influence on.

18             MR. KELLY: In the'50s.

19             THE COURT: Not so --

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me just add, specific

21         testimony, for example, about -- that comes

22        from documents that were not generated in 1950

23        or even the 1960s. It comes from later periods

24        of time. What he's doing is dividing intent

25        from those documents, I believe contrary to 4175

1        your Honor's order.

2             I understand we already addressed that he

3        can extrapolate back to the 1950s. What he

4        should be doing is talking about 1950 when

5        Mr. Piendle was young, 1950 documents, and

6        instead getting opinion without documents to

7        support it. And--but at that point the

8        opinion is already out.

9             Let me finish.

10             I object to that, and I also think there

11         are significant concerns here. The Supreme

12        Court decision of Riley directly addressed

13        product placement. He now expressed opinions

14        about product placement. Event today, it's all

15        protected, preempted, and shouldn't be allowed

16        in the first place.

17             THE COURT: Let me hear response from

18        counsel so we can move on.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I didn't understand the last

20        argument. I didn't hear the words "product

21        placement" from this witness' mouth.

22             But Dr. Cummings has clearly described his

23        background, training, and experience, his

24        compilation and study of a total of a universe

25        of 16 million documents, and he will, when the 4176

1        time comes, support the opinions specifically,

2        although he is not required to do that. Those

3        matters are for cross-examination, whether he

4        has an adequate basis to form the opinions,

5        whether the evidence exists to form those

6        opinions is a matter for cross-examination.

7             Once he has testified that these are the

8        kinds of documents that are ordinarily relied

9        upon by persons within his area of expertise

10        and there's opinions within his area of

11         expertise.

12             THE COURT: I guess what I would ask is

13        try to be as clear as possible in the

14        questioning because timing is an issue in terms

15        of how evidence can be used, and should defense

16        ask for a certain type of instruction that

17        certain evidence can be used for certain

18        reasons and not others, it is perhaps more

19        important than in other instances to be as

20        clear as possible as to what time frame we're

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=42
21         talking about and what he relied upon, and

22        maybe to the best of his ability what dates he

23        relied upon that to, at minimum, address the

24        Williams issue.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I do intend to introduce 4177

1         specific documents to support Dr. Cummings'

2        opinions, including documents from the '50s and

3        documents later that talk about retrospect or

4        are from a retrospective perspective to say

5        that is what we've been doing for years.

6             Counsel is right, there are documents in

7        the '80s following the same pattern, looking at

8        this and researching it for years.

9             MR. KELLY: It is a nexus to nothing. As

10        it turns out, we have to strike the whole thing

11         or move for mistrial. We just talked about

12        advertising I think for the first time. We

13        submitted a limiting instruction to you on

14        advertising. Do you remember that? It's been

15        a while ago. It was in our first, our very

16        first group we provided to you. I have another

17        copy.

18             THE COURT: You have a copy, but have you

19        seen it? Why don't you show it to him, and if

20        it's proper for me to give, I'll give it.

21              MR. KELLY: We just talked about it, but

22        we're going to move on.

23             MR. SCAROLA: I'm not introducing any of

24        those documents at this point. You didn't want

25        me to. You asked me not to do that. 4178

1              THE COURT: Bring up that instruction with

2        me later.

3             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

4        concluded and the following proceedings were

5        held within the presence of the jury:)

6             THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

7             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much,

8        your Honor.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   You have told us that the tobacco industry

11    recognized the significance of young smokers and

12   that efforts were made to design products that would

13   be appealing to that younger segment.

14             What, if anything, else did the tobacco

15   industry do to encourage people like Charlie Piendle

16   and his age cohort, during that period of time, in

17   the 1950s, to become smokers?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, question calls

19        for the witness to ascribe intent.

20             MR. SCAROLA: I asked for actions,

21         your Honor, what did they do.

22             THE COURT: Overruled.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=43
23        A.   They basically identified people in

24   advertising, the advertising themes, the people that

25   they put in the advertising that were attractive and 4179

1    appealing particularly to young people. So movie

2   stars, athletes. They showed young people doing

3   fun, sexy boy/girl kinds of things that would have a

4   unique appeal to a younger individual, because of

5   their awareness that their success of their brands

6   that they were selling and ultimately their

7   company's profits depended on their ability to get a

8   share of the youth market.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   When you talk about things like awareness

11    on the part of tobacco companies, are there specific

12   documents that you are going to be able to show us

13   during the course of your testimony that express

14   what the tobacco industry knew regarding these

15   matters?

16             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that's right on

17        point. Asking the witness to interpret a

18        document from the company with respect to their

19        meanings. The documents speak for themselves,

20        I believe is the ruling.

21              THE COURT: I don't believe the question

22        violates that order, and I overrule the

23        objection.

24        A.   Yes. 25

4180

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   What can you tell us about the degree of

3   success of efforts on the part of the tobacco

4   industry to capture the youth market in the 1950s?

5        A.   Very successful in the sense that as I

6   testified earlier of teenagers, teenage boys growing

7   up in the early 1950s, over 70 percent were smokers,

8   and so that's seven out of ten, it was a little

9   lower with females, but still the majority of that

10   age cohort became smokers.

11         Q.   So to the extent that Charlie Piendle

12   began smoking in the 1950s, he was doing what not

13   just the majority of his peers were doing, but what

14   the vast majority of his peers were doing; is that

15   correct?

16        A.   Yes, he was doing what the vast majority

17   of his peers were doing, and just what was intended

18   through the marketing plans that I've read from the

19   companies.

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, move to strike

21         "intended."

22             MR. SCAROLA: I'll ask a predicate

23        question, your Honor.

24             MR. KELLY: Is it stricken, your Honor?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=44
25            THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection at 4181

1        this point and ask the jury to disregard that

2        one last statement by the witness in order for

3        counsel to lay a predicate.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Is the intention of the tobacco companies

6   in the 1950s something that you have had to imply

7   from the documents, or are there express statements

8   in the tobacco industry's internal business records

9   that tell us what it is they intended?

10        A.   There are express statements within the

11    records.

12        Q.   And will you, during the course of your

13   testimony, be prepared to show those to us?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   Without getting into specific details

16   right now, does a review of the historical

17   literature indicate whether tobacco companies were

18   aware in the 1950s of the influence of peer pressure

19   on an individual's decision to begin to smoke? Is

20   that something that is acknowledged in the

21    documents?

22             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. Calls

23        for interpretation and speculation regarding

24        what people in the industry were aware of.

25        That would require mind reading. 4182

1              THE COURT: I think the question was, do

2        the documents reflect that the industry was

3        aware and if that's the question--

4             MR. SCAROLA: That's the question,

5        your Honor.

6             THE COURT: --then it's overruled.

7        A.   Yes, they were aware.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   Does the available documentary evidence

10   inform us as to whether that awareness played a role

11    in the conduct of the tobacco companies?

12             MR. KELLY: That calls for interpreting

13        documents, your Honor. And if you like, may I

14        have a continuing objection to these

15        interpretations of the documents as violative

16        of your in limine order so I don't have to keep

17        interrupting?

18             THE COURT: Yes, you may.

19             Overruled.

20        A.   Yes.

21      BY MR. SCAROLA:

22        Q.   Will you, during the course of your

23   testimony, be able to give us some specific examples

24   of how tobacco companies purposely manipulated peer

25   pressure to promote young people to start to smoke? 4183

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=45
1        A.   I will.

2        Q.   How do we know that this was an

3   intentional strategy, that is, how do we know that

4   young teens were the intended target of tobacco

5   industry marketing, and not just an accidental

6   byproduct of ad campaigns and marketing that were

7   really intended to reach adults?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the question

9        to the extent it's not limited to the 1950s.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   I'll reask it or -- reask it focusing on

12    1950s.

13        A.   It's expressly stated in the business

14   records that that was the intention because it

15   defined their future profitability.

16        Q.   How successful was the intentional

17   strategy to build peer pressure among young teens in

18   the direction of smoking? Did it work?

19        A.   Well, some companies were successful and

20   others were not. And it's reflected in the brands

21    that became successful among teens in the 1950s,

22    1960s, and other brands didn't, and that reflects

23   the failure of some of the companies that were

24   unsuccessful in getting a share of the youth market.

25             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection. Move to 4184

1         strike the portion of the answer about the

2         1960s, your Honor.

3             THE COURT: Well, the answer should be

4        limited just to the question of the 1950s.

5        A.   Sorry.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   What are the companies, which are the

8   companies that were most successful in the 1950s in

9   their strategy to target young smokers?

10        A.   The most successful companies were

11    R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Philip Morris.

12        Q.   And with which brands in particular did

13   they have that greatest success?

14        A.   Well, starting early in the 1950s, just as

15   an explanation, because an explanation is needed

16   because things changed. The early part of the

17    1950s, the most successful brands among young people

18   were Lucky Strike and Camel, but Lucky Strike by

19   far. Actually --

20        Q.   Products of which companies?

21         A.   That was American Tobacco. In 1953, in

22   particular, when I started plotting forward the most

23   popular brands.

24             Filters had come in in 1952, but there

25   were some new brands, Winston and Marlboro, as 4185

1   filtered cigarettes in 1954, and Winston was in

2   particular a popular brand, as was Marlboro, not

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=46
3   quite as popular in the 1950s. Winston picked up a

4   large share as you follow the trends in teenage

5   smokers and young adults, the college-aged kids as

6   well during the 1950s.

7             Kent also became a popular brand, and Pall

8   Mall, which was an unfiltered product in the 1950s,

9   had picked up a large share of young people,

10   teenagers and young adults, in the late 1940s and in

11    the 1950s because of extra length. So it was

12   actually a way of cooling the smoke that was there.

13   The extra mildness you got in a Pall Mall was

14   because of the extra length of the cigarettes.

15             So those were -- you had basically -- the

16   end of 1950s, you had Winston, Kent, Pall Mall and

17   Marlboro as the top brands among teens.

18        Q.   At the time the tobacco industry was

19   pursuing this strategy to target young people to

20   begin smoking, did the tobacco companies know about

21    the health hazards of smoking, particularly during

22   this period in the 1950s?

23        A.   Yes, they did.

24        Q.   Again, will you be able to show us

25   specific documents during the course of your 4186

1   testimony that demonstrate the knowledge on the part

2   of the tobacco companies while at the very time they

3   were targeting young people to begin smoking, that

4   there was a direct link between smoking and serious

5   health problems?

6        A.   Yes, I will.

7        Q.   While the campaign to market to young

8   people was being carried out, was there any real

9   uncertainty within the tobacco industry about the

10   link between smoking and, in particular, lung

11    cancer?

12             MR. KELLY: Calls for speculation,

13        your Honor. That's awfully overbroad.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I suggest it is a very

15        specific and narrow question.

16             THE COURT: Can you ask the question,

17        again?

18             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry?

19             THE COURT: Can you ask the question

20        again?

21              MR. SCAROLA: Yes.

22     BY MR. SCAROLA:

23        Q.   While the campaign to market to young

24   people was being carried out in the 1950s, you've

25   told us that there was an awareness within the 4187

1   industry of the health hazards of smoking. I want

2   to narrow that down.

3             Was there an awareness within the tobacco

4   industry not only about health hazards in general,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=47
5   but specifically, was there any real uncertainly

6   within the tobacco industry about the fact that

7   smoking and lung cancer were directly linked?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the extent

9        it's not limited to the 1950s, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: I think the question was

11        prefaced with the 1950s. Overruled. I'll

12        allow you to answer the question if you can as

13        it relates to the 1950s.

14        A.   Yes, by late 1950s, the companies believed

15   that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   What did the industry know about the

18   addictive properties of nicotine in the 1950s?

19             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, would it be clear

20        for the jury that these are all Dr. Cummings'

21         opinions? I know counsel doesn't want to ask

22        these questions in that form, but --

23             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I would be happy

24        to ask the question in that form each time. I

25        thought that I very clearly prefaced this 4188

1         entire line of questioning with the express

2        understanding that what Dr. Cummings was going

3        to be doing was only expressing opinions to a

4        reasonable degree of certainty within his area

5        of expertise, and if he's not able to do that,

6        he understands he is not to answer that

7        question.

8             THE COURT: I think that was made clear,

9        and I'll let you proceed to ask questions in

10        the format you're using with that

11         understanding.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   What did the industry know about the

14   addictive properties of nicotine in the 1950s while

15   they were targeting youth?

16        A.   They knew that nicotine was addictive, and

17   they knew nicotine was the main reason that people

18   smoked, and they knew it was hard for people to quit

19   smoking because of nicotine addiction.

20        Q.   Again, are you going to be able during the

21    course of your testimony to show us specific

22   documents that demonstrate that knowledge at the

23   very same time when Charlie Piendle was first

24   starting to smoke?

25        A.   Yes. 4189

1         Q.   Was the fact that the tobacco industry

2   knew cigarettes caused cancer knowledge that the

3   tobacco industry shared with the general public back

4   in the 1950s?

5        A.   No, just the opposite. They said it

6   didn't cause injury to health.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=48
7        Q.   What was the tobacco industry's general

8   message about the link between smoking and disease

9   when Charlie Piendle was in the early stages of his

10   use of cigarettes?

11         A.   Smoking was not injurious to health.

12        Q.   Will you be able during the course of your

13   testimony to give us some specific examples of how

14   the tobacco industry, and specifically these

15   defendants, actively set out to mislead the public

16   with regard to the known link between smoking and

17   serious health hazards, including lung cancer?

18        A.   Yes.

19        Q.   When was the tobacco industry's knowledge

20   about the health hazards of smoking first shared

21    with the public in an honest way?

22        A.   Among these defendants, it was November of

23   2000.

24        Q.   How did the industry's knowledge of

25   addiction affect the industry's advertising and 4190

1   marketing strategy?

2        A.   It was an integral part of their marketing

3   strategy, because their knowledge of addiction was

4   utilized to design and market their products.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the extent

6        this is not limiting in time period.

7             MR. SCAROLA: I will limit it in time.

8             THE COURT: Okay.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   During the period between the mid to late

11    1950s when Charlie Piendle began to smoke through

12    1986, when Charlie Piendle stopped smoking, during

13   that approximately 30-year period of time, how did

14   the industry's knowledge of addiction affect the

15   industry's advertising and marketing strategy?

16             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that's overbroad.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Would counsel -- your Honor,

18        I'll take it decade by decade, if counsel wants

19        me to.

20             THE COURT: What do you mean by

21         "overbroad"?

22             MR. KELLY: It's overbroad as to time and

23        as to the industry. There are claims against

24        the individual companies here that should be

25        specifically linked, not generally made over a 4191

1         30-year time period. There's no way for us to

2        know specifically what the witness is talking

3        about.

4             THE COURT: I'll allow the witness to

5        answer the question, if he can, being as

6        specific as you can as to if there are

7        particular companies that you're referring to,

8        and during what time period. So the witness

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=49
9        can answer the question that way, I'll allow it

10        to be asked.

11         A.   Sure. I can answer it that way in

12   particular to the companies. In the 1950s,

13   companies were utilizing different blends of

14   cigarettes, so they had changed the blend to go to a

15   use of more burley tobacco, typically used in

16   filtered cigarettes. They also were utilizing

17   reconstituted tobacco in their blends, at least some

18   of their blends, beginning in the 1950s, and that

19   was both Reynolds and Philip Morris.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   What did the choice of type of tobacco

22   have to do with the company's knowledge of the

23   addictive properties of nicotine?

24        A.   Everything, because the blend influences

25   the nicotine delivery, so certain blends of tobacco, 4192

1    such as burley tobacco, has a higher nicotine

2   content. They could use burley tobacco in a

3   filtered cigarette because the filter affected the

4   irritation, made it less harsh to smoke the

5   cigarette, so they could use the cheaper, higher

6   nicotine content, burley tobacco.

7             The use of reconstituted tobacco and some

8   of the extraction procedures that were used in

9   making reconstituted tobacco where you take the

10   nicotine out, you take the color out, and then you

11    can reapply it on the reconstituted -- on the

12   material that's left over, this white slurry that

13   they create, they glue it with a little pectin, and

14   then they can spray the nicotine back on the sheet.

15             And that's important because as they were

16   putting less tobacco just by weight in the product,

17   you had to control the nicotine, the minimum amount

18   of nicotine in that product very carefully to

19   maintain that person's smoking behavior, and you

20   can't do that through simple blending of natural

21    tobacco leaves because the amount of tobacco in a

22   leaf will vary quite a bit. Some will be loaded

23   with nicotine, another leaf will have hardly any,

24   and just to simply blend it together doesn't work.

25             So the addition of reconstituted tobacco 4193

1   where you spray, in a uniform way, the precise dose

2   of nicotine on that sheet. So you take it out and

3   you reapply it. And there are patents going back

4   decades, actually into the 1920s, that talk about

5   nicotine extraction processes that existed and were

6   available and utilized by the tobacco companies and

7   perfected over time, so that did change over

8   decades.

9             But certainly there are documents that

10   talk about extraction procedures and reapplying

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=50
11    nicotine to maintain the smokers' satisfaction

12   level, which is code word for addiction.

13        Q.   Dr. Cummings, I want to be sure that we

14   understand this aspect of your testimony. First of

15   all, explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury

16   what reconstituted tobacco is, what is it and what

17   is the process by which tobacco becomes

18   reconstituted?

19        A.   Well, reconstituted tobacco is manmade

20   tobacco. It's not natural, it's manufactured

21    tobacco. It's simply the same as making a piece of

22   paper that's made of wood pulp, and it's a manmade

23   product. And the same is true with reconstituted

24   tobacco, and you can make reconstituted tobacco from

25   recycled tobacco, tobacco that's not sold on the 4194

1    shelf, it's stale, they bring it back, they can

2   reuse it.

3             The stems and the stalks of the tobacco

4   plant, which used to be discarded, now could be

5   utilized. They would grind those up, as well as

6   leaf that they would grind and they would literally

7   put it through a grinding process and extraction

8   using various methods to take the nicotine and color

9   out of the product. They are left with this white

10   slurry material that they would put out on big

11    drying sheets, and as I said, glue it with pectin

12   was one of the things that they can utilize to hold

13   the material together, and then they reapply color

14   and they reapply the nicotine, but they do so in a

15   way that's manmade in that it's precise in terms of

16   the dosing and the coloring that you're going to

17   give the product.

18             And products that tended to have less

19   tobacco, they would use more recon, so there's

20   variation across blends and it's changed over time

21    in the amount of reconstituted tobacco that's used

22   in different brands of cigarettes over time.

23        Q.   Did both R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris

24   use reconstituted tobacco during the 1950s?

25        A.   Yes. 4195

1         Q.   And they -- they possessed the knowledge

2   and technology to actually remove the nicotine out

3   of the tobacco in the reconstituting process?

4        A.   Well, they possess the knowledge through

5   various extraction procedures, and there are a

6   variety of patents that date back into the 1920s

7   that talk about nicotine extraction from tobacco.

8        Q.   And not only did they know how to do it

9   and have the technology to be able to do it, they

10   were actually doing it in the 1950s, that is, taking

11    nicotine out and then putting it back in in measured

12   doses into cigarettes?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=51
13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Did the industry's knowledge of addiction

15   affect not only the design and manufacture of

16   cigarettes, but also the advertising and marketing

17   campaigns utilized by the tobacco industry,

18   including these defendants, during the time period

19   while Charlie Piendle was smoking?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   How?

22        A.   Well, they would advertise aspects of

23   nicotine delivery having to do with satisfying smoke

24   was the common message that you would see in a lot

25   of advertising, which relates directly to the effect 4196

1    of nicotine physiologically for the smoker that

2   they're going to get the nicotine that they're

3   seeking because nicotine is the drug reinforced

4   reason that people continue to smoke.

5             In some advertising, they advertised

6   different levels of nicotine because they knew that

7   smokers were concerned about nicotine, believing a

8   misperception that nicotine actually causes cancer,

9   which it does not, but business records that I've

10   seen from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company specifically

11    talked about and surveyed smokers, asking them about

12   nicotine as a risk and they recognized that

13   consumers did not understand how nicotine affected

14   their health, but they did know that it affected the

15   reason they continued to smoke, that is, the

16   companies did.

17        Q.   Based upon your education, training,

18   experience and particularly upon your research as it

19   focused on Charlie Piendle's age group, his age

20   cohort, would it have been likely that persons

21    within that cohort would have been consciously aware

22   of how their decision to begin smoking was being

23   purposely manipulated by the tobacco industry?

24        A.   No. They would not have been aware at all

25   about some of the design features of the product or 4197

1   most people aren't aware of how they're affected by

2   advertising. So they see it, they don't think

3   they're swayed by it, but when you look at the

4   science of advertising and there is the science to

5   it, certainly it is a -- it's a very calculated,

6   planful effort that was made to get people to smoke

7   certain brands of cigarettes, because that

8   essentially dictated the profitability of the

9   companies.

10        Q.   If you were to ask the vast majority of

11    those seven out of ten people in Charlie's age group

12   who began smoking back in the mid to late 1950s,

13   whether any tobacco company ever did anything to

14   cause them to start smoking or to keep them from

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=52
15   quitting, what is your -- what does your expertise

16   indicate their answer would be?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, calls for

18        speculation.

19             THE COURT: Rephrase the question.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   Have you conducted research into

22   individual's awareness of the factors that cause

23   them to begin to smoke?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   And based upon that research, do you have 4198

1    an opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty,

2   within your area of expertise, as to whether the

3   vast majority of people, if they were asked whether

4   tobacco companies ever had anything to do with

5   causing them to smoke, would recognize the influence

6   that tobacco companies had over their smoking

7   decisions?

8        A.   They would not recognize it, has been my

9   experience. People don't have any awareness. They

10   typically say, I did it because my friends did it or

11    to look cool, but they really don't have an

12   understanding, a depth of understanding of what was

13   done, and what was actually implemented to try to

14   draw them in. Now, not everybody becomes a smoker,

15   but in the 1950s, most people who were men did

16   take -- become smokers.

17        Q.   You have told us that there was an actual

18   knowledge on the part of tobacco companies,

19   including these defendants in the 1950s, of the

20   diseases and mortality caused by smoking that was

21    not shared with the general public.

22             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'm going to

23        object to counsel's summarizing the testimony

24        repeatedly in the questioning he's doing. It's

25        very argumentative. 4199

1              MR. SCAROLA: It's simply a predicate to

2        this question.

3             THE COURT: I'll have you rephrase without

4        using the predicate.

5             MR. SCAROLA: I will be happy to do that.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Whether Charlie Piendle and others in his

8   age group realized it or not, what, if anything,

9   were cigarette companies, including these

10   defendants, doing to keep Charlie and others like

11    him smoking, despite what became a growing awareness

12   of a link between smoking and health hazards?

13             MR. KELLY: Can we have a time frame,

14        please, your Honor?

15     BY MR. SCAROLA:

16        Q.   During the period from the late 1950s

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=53
17   through 1986.

18             MR. KELLY: It's overbroad, your Honor.

19             THE COURT: I'll overrule to the extent

20        the witness can answer the question as

21         specifically as possible with respect to which

22        companies and which time frame.

23        A.   Sure. Both R.J. Reynolds and Philip

24   Morris in the 1950s --25

4200

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Sorry, I am reminded that I have

3   repeatedly used the 1986 date, and I should be using

4   the 1989 date, and I apologize for that. The

5   question is expanded to include those extra three

6   years to 1989, when it was that Charlie actually

7   started to smoke.

8             Everybody else knew that. I keep making a

9   mistake.

10        A.   I knew it too, but I wasn't going to say

11    it.

12        Q.   Correct me -- correct me at any time you

13   need to, Dr. Cummings. Don't hesitate to do that.

14   I apologize for the error.

15        A.   Both the defendants, Philip Morris and

16   R.J. Reynolds in the 1950s, things that they did.

17   They formed and funded an organization that put out

18   reassuring statements to the public through the

19   media, through various spokespeople that appeared

20   through various popular media of the time, through

21    an extensive public relations campaign to reassure

22   smokers that cigarette smoking was not injurious to

23   the health. This was something that they continued

24   to do.

25             Through an offshoot of the Tobacco 4201

1   Industry Research Committee created in 1954, and

2   that offshoot organization was The Tobacco Institute

3   in 1958, and they continued to do that, and that

4   message was all the way through 1989, in terms of

5   reassuring smokers that it had not been proven that

6   smoking was the cause of disease of any kind, and

7   that we just don't know what causes the diseases

8   that are alleged to be related to smoking. So that

9   was one thing. It was a public relations campaign

10   that was funded, executed by both of the defendants,

11    they both contributed to it, they both had their

12   high level executives oversee the messaging that

13   would come from those organizations.

14             They also designed product, both of these

15   companies, to reassure smokers. They added filters

16   in the 1950s. They came out with two popular

17   filtered brands, probably the most popular filtered

18   brands sold in the period that Mr. Piendle was a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=54
19   cigarette smoker, and those brands, by the way,

20   maintained nicotine levels so people would continue

21    to smoke, so it would keep you smoking. They didn't

22   drop below the threshold of nicotine where a person

23   would be able to quit easily. So they constrained

24   his choice, and that was not something that was told

25   to smokers, that was a -- that was known to the 4202

1    companies, and they studied it very carefully to

2   know what that level would be.

3             And so those were the two main things, the

4   product design and the reassuring -- reassurance

5   campaign that was run by the companies, and then

6   they spent hundreds and hundreds of millions of

7   dollars in advertising, and much of that advertising

8   portrayed smoking as sexy, athletic, fun. They

9   didn't talk about the health risks of smoking at

10   all. In fact, they did just the opposite, said

11    cigarettes will give you satisfying taste and if

12   you're a little worried, you can go to a low-tar

13   cigarettes.

14             So low-tar cigarettes began to come in

15   right after the Surgeon General's report. A design

16   feature called cigarette vents was introduced by a

17   company, five days before the 1964 Surgeon General's

18   reports. And then two of the most popular low-tar

19   brands were introduced by the defendants, Reynolds

20   introduced versions of Winston, Winston Light became

21    a light version, and then Doral was a light

22   cigarette, and Merit was a major investment by

23   Philip Morris to introduce a low-tar cigarette with

24   a great taste. So they reassured smokers that it

25   was okay to continue to smoke through that design 4203

1   feature even though those claims were not true.

2             MR. KELLY: May we approach, your Honor?

3             THE COURT: Yes.

4             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

5        held out of the presence of the jury:)

6             MR. KELLY: That's why I objected

7        overbroad. We got a 30-year speech on

8        everything counsel wants to put in the case. I

9        don't imagine the witness needs to show up

10        tomorrow. Everything he is going to say is

11         cumulative to what he said so far. It's

12        argument, nonresponsive testimony, narrative,

13        lecturing to the jury.

14             We have no basis to object to all this

15        inadmissible material that is Williams/State

16        Farm violating, interpreting documents. The

17        questions are so overbroad, we have no idea

18        what he's going to say. He's now in hundreds

19        of millions of dollars of advertising. There

20        is limiting instruction in the case, I'd like

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=55
21         you to read it now. I'd like you to read the

22        limiting instruction now on advertising.

23        There's no way that we would have known he was

24        going to talk about advertising in response to

25        that question, it's just way too broad. 4204

1              THE COURT: Let counsel take a look at the

2        limiting instruction.

3             MR. KELLY: I guess as long as we're

4        waiting, we have a motion for mistrial we'd

5        like to make at the conclusion of the evidence

6        today. I know you wanted me to tell you as

7        soon as we thought of it.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: To the extent there's an

9        attack on advertising as reassuring; i.e.,

10        deluding the warning is specifically preempted

11         after July 1st, 1969.

12             THE COURT: What is counsel's position,

13        first of all, on instruction?

14             MR. SCAROLA: It's my understanding

15        your Honor has not ruled on. I don't want to

16        address it, if you said this is an instruction

17        you were going to give. But I don't think you

18        have; am I correct?

19             MR. KELLY: You're correct. We were going

20        to wait until it came up.

21              MR. SCAROLA: I don't have an objection to

22        the instruction as long as it is modified to

23        reflect that truthful advertising is

24        constitutionally protected. There is no

25        constitutional protection for false and 4205

1        misleading advertising.

2             So if the instruction were to be modified

3        so that it is made clear that there is no

4        constitutional protection for false and

5        misleading advertising, I think that can be

6        done simply by adding at the end there is no

7        constitutional protection for false or

8        misleading advertising.

9             MR. KELLY: There is no claim for false or

10        misleading advertising in this case. There's

11         no claim for fraud in this case.

12             THE COURT: That was included in the jury

13        instruction; was it not?

14             MR. SCAROLA: I believe so.

15             THE COURT: Jury instructions that I read.

16        Let me just see. Okay. Is there objection

17        from defense as I'm looking to adding that

18        sentence?

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: I can't hear you.

20             THE COURT: Is there objection from

21         defense to add that sentence while I'm looking

22        for it?

23             MR. KELLY: If we could, let's get what

24        you instructed earlier.

25             THE COURT: This was in the original jury 4206

1        instructions. You-all objected to it, but I

2        read it about false claim.

3             MR. KELLY: I think Noerr-Pennington.

4             THE COURT: Yeah, it was. You would have

5        to tell the jury that there is no claim for

6        false or misleading advertising in this case,

7        though, that's why we didn't put it in.

8             MR. SCAROLA: There is a claim for

9        deception in this case, that deception can come

10        in any form, including the specific campaign

11         intended to mislead jurors -- excuse me,

12        mislead consumers with respect to both the

13        addictive properties and health hazards of

14        tobacco.

15             MR. KELLY: That's completely wrong.

16        That's a decision in Riley. In advertising you

17        don't have to tell the client everything, as

18        long as it's accurate, no claim in this case,

19        it's inaccurate that that's a correct statement

20        of the law for this case.

21              THE COURT: I'm going to read the

22        instruction, it's the first occurrence, and I

23        am just going to ask to avoid issues like this,

24        maybe make your questions -- break them down.

25        Let's break them down so the answers can be 4207

1        more -- and I'll remind our witness as well,

2        but if the question is large, it is hard for

3        him to be narrow. Maybe starting with

4        counsel's questioning, and it may take more

5        questions to do it, but I think it's the better

6        approach.

7             MR. KELLY: That way I can object.

8             MR. SCAROLA: Is your Honor going to read

9        it, however?

10             THE COURT: I'm going to read the

11         instruction as it's written right here.

12             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

13        concluded and the following proceedings were

14        held within the presence of the jury:)

15             THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

16        you have heard evidence regarding defendants'

17        advertising activities. Defendants have the

18        right to advertise their products. Advertising

19        is commercial speech that is protected by the

20        First Amendment to the United States

21         Constitution.

22             Accordingly, I instruct you that you may

23        not find liability based on the mere fact the

24        defendants have advertised their products or

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=57
25        the amount spent by defendants in advertising 4208

1        their products. Defendants are entitled to

2        advertise their products under the law.

3        Likewise, you may not hold the defendants

4        liable because of who may have found their

5        cigarette advertising or promotion to be

6        appealing.

7             Counsel may proceed.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   Dr. Cummings, in addition to advertising

10   statements denying any link between health problems,

11    including lung cancer specifically and smoking, at a

12   time when these defendants knew that that link

13   existed, were those companies making public

14   statements saying those same things?

15        A.   Yes, the companies were, and primarily

16   during that period of time --

17        Q.   Which period of time are we talking about

18   now?

19        A.   1954 to 1989, it was done by the Tobacco

20   Institute or the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

21    through a public relations firm that had been hired,

22   Hill & Knowlton, paid for by the companies, and they

23   served as the spokespeople, that was part of what

24   their job was, to serve as spokespeople on smoking

25   and health issues for the companies for these 4209

1    defendants.

2        Q.   Did the company executives themselves

3   reinforce that message in public statements?

4        A.   They did.

5        Q.   Did they go on beyond mere public

6   statements to make sworn statements to reinforce a

7   position that they knew to be false?

8        A.   Yes.

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection.

10             MR. KELLY: If it's just a yes, that's

11         fine.

12             MR. SCAROLA: That's all it is right now.

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: I object.

14             MR. KELLY: It's overbroad, your Honor.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Noerr-Pennington.

16             THE COURT: Overrule the objection.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   What was the significance of the fact that

19   during this period of time through the '50s, the

20   '60s -- well, let's take it one decade at a time.

21   What is the significance of the fact that during the

22   '50s, the tobacco industry, including these

23   defendants, were denying known links between serious

24   health problems and smoking to the individual

25   smoker? 4210

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=58
1              MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. That's

2        ambiguous what he means by "significance." It

3        calls for a speech from the witness.

4        Williams/State Farm --

5             MR. SCAROLA: I'll withdraw and restate

6        the question.

7             THE COURT: Rephrase consistent with our

8        discussion.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   Have you studied the impact that

11    statements such as those we are discussing had on

12   smokers' ability to be able to come to a decision to

13   quit?

14        A.   Yes, I have.

15        Q.   Have you studied that impact as it existed

16   in the 1950s, the '60s, the 70s, and the '80s?

17        A.   I have.

18        Q.   What impact did it have in the'50s?

19        A.   The impact it had was it gave people a

20   psychological crutch and self-rationale to keep

21    smoking, and cigarette sales actually increased as a

22   result of the public relations efforts funded by the

23   defendants, and they touted those efforts and said

24   that they had been successful for them.

25        Q.   Did the tobacco industry know that what 4211

1   they were doing was giving people a psychological

2   crutch that would cause them to keep smoking when

3   they wanted to stop?

4             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that calls for

5        interpretation of mental states of people.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I'll rephrase the question.

7             THE COURT: Sustained.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I'll rephrase the question.

9             THE COURT: Rephrase.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   Did tobacco industry expressly state in

12   black and white that they were entirely aware of the

13   fact that what they were doing was providing people

14   a psychological crutch so that they would keep

15   smoking, even though they were being told by others

16   that it was bad for them?

17             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, we went through

18        this with Dr. Burns. This is cumulative. This

19        exact point was gone through with Dr. Burns.

20             THE COURT: Okay. Response.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor. If the

22        defendants choose to concede this point, there

23        is no need to adduce additional evidence. If

24        it is a contested point, the fact that two

25        witnesses from two separate areas of expertise 4212

1         are addressing this same issue does not make it

2        overly cumulative testimony.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=59
3             MR. KELLY: Two witnesses interpreting

4        company documents makes it all the more

5        improper.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I haven't asked for

7        interpretation.

8             MR. KELLY: It violates the in limine

9        ruling. This witness has no more knowledge of

10        what people wrote in 1969 from interpreting

11         their words than anybody else.

12             THE COURT: I'm going to overrule the

13        objection.

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: I further object. The

15        question was for 1950s.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   Do you remember the statement -- the

18   question?

19        A.   Not really.

20        Q.   Okay. Let me restate it for you,

21    Dr. Cummings. Did the tobacco companies, at the

22   time when they were denying the link that they knew

23   to exist between smoking and serious health

24   problems, including cancer, know -- I'm sorry, did

25   they say they knew that what they were doing was 4213

1   providing a psychological crutch that would keep

2   people smoking, despite a growing awareness of the

3   health risks?

4             MR. KELLY: Same objections, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Overruled.

6        A.   Yes. They did during the 1950s, '60s, and

7   onward. They didn't always use the term

8   "psychological crutch." They sometimes used other

9   terms, but it was clearly designed to sway public

10   opinion to the opinion that it hadn't been proved

11    that smoking caused disease. They talked about it

12   in their business records as being a brilliantly

13   conceived strategy.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   What does your training, your experience,

16   and your research teach about whether Charlie and

17   others during the 1950s recognized how the tobacco

18   industry was executing its agreement to manipulate

19   public opinion about the link between smoking and

20   health risks?

21              MR. KELLY: I'm not sure what that

22        question asks for. It sounds like speculation

23        of what people believed in the '50s, including

24        Mr. Piendle. There is no foundation for that

25        kind of testimony. 4214

1              THE COURT: Can you rephrase the question?

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   Have you conducted research into what

4   smokers believed about the link between smoking and

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=60
5   health hazards during the 1950s?

6        A.   I have.

7        Q.   Have you conducted research into what

8   people believed about the link that existed between

9   smoking, what smokers believed about the link

10   between smoking and health hazards in the '60s?

11         A.   I have.

12        Q.   Same question with regard to the 70s?

13        A.   Same answer, I have.

14        Q.   Same question with regard to the '80s?

15        A.   I've looked at it in the'80s.

16        Q.   What does that research disclose with

17   regard to the '50s?

18        A.   The early '50s, less than 1 percent of

19   smokers believed that there is a link between

20   smoking and lung cancer.

21         Q.   How, if at all, did that change in the

22   '60s?

23        A.   Awareness increased that smoking was a

24   health hazard and possible cause of cancer. General

25   belief that smoking caused lung cancer also 4215

1   increased in the 1960s, but the personalized belief

2   was still now, and the majority of people did not

3   accept the fact that their smoking would cause them

4   harm.

5        Q.   How did that change, if at all, in the

6   '70s?

7        A.   Well, as more information came out,

8   awareness increased, general belief increased,

9   personalized belief increased, and that's reflected

10   in trends that we see in the percentage of the

11   population who were smokers beginning to quit.

12        Q.   Does your research indicate as to whether

13   there was any awareness on the part of smokers that

14   public opinion with regard to the link between

15   smoking and health risks was being purposely

16   manipulated by the tobacco industry?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   What does your research indicate in that

19   regard?

20        A.   My research indicates that the industry

21    tracked the beliefs of smokers, their awareness of

22   risks, and explicitly designed their public

23   relations activities to try to manipulate public

24   opinion to reassure smokers, to reassure the public

25   at large, but smokers as part of that group, that it 4216

1   hadn't been proved that smoking caused disease and

2   that there were alternative causes for what they

3   referred to as the constitutional hypothesis that

4   there was something about somebody's genetics that

5   caused them to get the disease, not their smoking.

6        Q.   Was there a general awareness among

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=61
7   smokers that the information being generated out of

8   the tobacco industry was false?

9        A.   No.

10        Q.   Was there a general awareness among

11    smokers that information that the tobacco industry

12   had was being withheld from them?

13        A.   No, they were told that it wasn't being

14   withheld, that -- the industry explicitly promised

15   to share what they knew with the public and said

16   that repeatedly.

17        Q.   Is there an indication from the research

18   that you have done if there was reliance upon those

19   promises?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   And was there?

22        A.   There was. The companies expected

23   consumers to rely on those opinions, and my studies

24   show that consumers did rely on those opinions,

25   because they said there was a debate, and that was 4217

1   very common, particularly in the '50s and '60s and

2   '70s, and that's changed over time as the

3   information environment has changed.

4             But it was very common opinion for people

5   to say, well, we just don't know, maybe the risks

6   are exaggerated, and those were exactly what the

7   intent of the public relations efforts from the

8   campaign was to achieve. And they talked about the

9   success of the campaign.

10             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I know it's

11         after 5:00 o'clock. I'm prepared to continue

12        for as long as your Honor would like, or I can

13        stop here.

14             THE COURT: Is this a convenient stopping

15        point?

16             MR. SCAROLA: Yes.

17             THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we will

18        conclude for the day. We'll resume tomorrow at

19        9:30 in the morning, with the same important

20        instruction, to avoid any media coverage of the

21         case, should there be any on TV or newspaper or

22        otherwise, to refrain from any discussions with

23        anyone about the case, to refrain from any kind

24        of research about any of the issues that have

25        arisen in this case, and to refrain from any 4218

1         contact with anyone associated with the case.

2        So with that, thank you very much, have a nice

3        evening, and we'll see you back here at 9:30

4        tomorrow morning.

5             I remind the witness, you remain under

6        oath, and you are not to discuss your testimony

7        with anyone.

8             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=62
9        after which a recess was taken from

10        5:06 p.m. until 5:13 p.m., after which the

11         following proceedings were held:)

12             THE COURT: All right. Where are we

13        picking up, or where did we leave off?

14             MR. KELLY: I think there's a motion for

15        mistrial to be made.

16             THE COURT: Okay. Make that.

17             MR. KELLY: On behalf of the defendants, I

18        move for a mistrial. As I mentioned at the

19        bench when we were here for the sidebar

20        conference, I would do this the first

21         opportunity you allowed me to do that.

22             THE COURT: Correct.

23             MR. KELLY: We raised the objection at the

24        first opportunity when Mr. Cumming --

25        Dr. Cummings, excuse me, began testifying about 4219

1        his interpretation of documents and the meaning

2        of documents and the intent of the companies

3        based upon his interpretation of the meaning of

4        documents, that that testimony in opinion form

5        violated the in limine order that your Honor

6        issued with respect to the prohibition against

7        witnesses offering opinions concerning the

8        interpretation and meaning of company

9        documents.

10             The testimony -- and you were kind enough

11         to provide us with a continuing objection on

12        that basis to Dr. Cummings' testimony so that

13        we would not have to continue to interrupt it

14        with objections, but on reflection, your Honor,

15        I think you'll find that the entire scope of

16        his testimony is an opinion of what the

17        company's intent and motive and purpose and

18        design was over 40 or 50 years, based upon his

19        review of documents which he has interpreted to

20        support his opinions of what the company

21         intended, meant, et cetera.

22             So we have a situation, your Honor, where

23        you had issued an in limine order that was

24        specifically on point. We raised an objection

25        based upon the order as soon as we could when 4220

1        the order was violated, that objection was

2        overruled, subsequent objections on the same

3        grounds were overruled.

4             You provided us with a continuing

5        objection, which I appreciate, but the reality

6        is, then, that over the course of the

7        afternoon, Dr. Cummings offered nothing but his

8        opinion interpreting company documents

9        concerning their meaning and their intent and

10        their purpose, and all of that is inadmissible,

12        without any foundation in science or technology

13        to allow its admissibility as an expert

14        opinion, and it was subject to the in limine

15        order, it's the reason we made the in limine

16        motion, it was well within the scope of the

17        order, the order has been violated. The order

18        has not been--

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: Adhered to.

20             MR. KELLY: -- adhered to -- thank you,

21         Counsel -- when the objection was raised.

22             THE COURT: Okay. Response.

23             MR. KELLY: So, on that ground, I would

24        move for a mistrial.

25             THE COURT: Okay. So you've spoken on 4221

1        behalf of Philip Morris.

2             MR. HENK: May I supplement what my

3        partner said?

4             THE COURT: I think I've heard what I

5        needed. Let me hear a response. And if I need

6        a reply, maybe you can --

7             MR. KELLY: Well, your Honor, we probably

8        should get our full motion, if I overlooked

9        something, so that counsel can respond to

10        everything --

11              THE COURT: Is there another basis for the

12        motion for mistrial, or is it 

13             MR. HENK: Yes, additional -

14             THE COURT: -- supplementing with respect

15        to the intent issue?

16             MR. HENK: Additional legal grounds.

17             THE COURT: On a different issue other

18        than intent or meaning of documents?

19             MR. HENK: On all of Dr. Cummings'

20        testimony about company conduct.

21              THE COURT: What are the additional

22        grounds?

23             MR. HENK: The additional grounds, your

24        Honor, very briefly, are due process rights,

25        the defendants' due process rights under 4222

1        Williams/State Farm; preemption, because now --

2        and by the way, plaintiffs counsel tried to

3        use preemption, I believe it was yesterday, and

4        I think successfully, in trying to exclude

5        evidence. We'll check the transcript on that

6        and renew it in writing.

7             First amendment, Riley, because now

8        Dr. Cummings is being asked questions from the

9        mid-1950s to 1986 originally, that was a

10        mistake, and now we have 1989. So we're

11         covering over several important time frames

12        now, including past July 1, 1969, and including

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=64
13        past, let's say, certainly 21 would have been

14        Mr. Piendle or 1962. So he was no longer under

15        any definition a youth after 1962.

16             So we're having violations of preemption,

17        Riley, the First Amendment, and

18        Noerr-Pennington. He hasn't explained what the

19        sworn testimony is, but now he's talking about

20        our sworn testimony, that particular conduct.

21              So as additional grounds for a motion for

22        mistrial based on all of the testimony that

23        Dr. Cummings has given with respect to company

24        conduct, those are to be additional grounds for

25        the motion for mistrial. 4223

1              THE COURT: All right. Any additional

2        grounds from R.J., or are you joining in?

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: No, but we're joining in.

4             THE COURT: Response.

5             MR. SCAROLA: The questions were framed so

6        as to scrupulously avoid the solicitation of

7        any information with regard to intent or

8        motive. The questions asked what the companies

9        did, what the companies said, what the

10        companies wrote based upon the documents and

11         the research that this witness performed.

12             No question elicited any information with

13        regard to intent or came anywhere close to

14        violating your Honor's order, an order which,

15        incidentally, we stipulated to. We agreed to

16        the entry of that order, agreed it would be

17        inappropriate where a document speaks for

18        itself for a witness to attempt to tell the

19        jury what the author of that document, which

20        requires no interpretation, meant by what he

21         said.

22             Thank you, your Honor.

23             THE COURT: Well, the order relates to

24        motion 20, and it was ordered and adjudged that

25        the defendants' motion in limine to preclude 4224

1         expert testimony regarding the meaning or

2        intent of company documents is granted to the

3        extent that no expert may testify as to the

4        intent or meaning of company documents where

5        the document speaks for itself, but otherwise

6        deferred until trial.

7             The Court did not find that the plaintiff

8        violated the order insofar as the expert was

9        being elicited to testify about the intent or

10        meaning of company documents, but rather, it

11         falls within the deferred until trial, and the

12        Court finds that the testimony given by the

13        witness was utilized to put documents in

14        context, and testimony as to historical,

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=65
15        complex, scientific, or medical documents, and

16        then an adequate predicate had been shown for

17        the expert's opinion.

18             So the motion to -- for mistrial on that

19        basis is denied for those reasons, and

20        furthermore, the motion for mistrial on the

21         other bases are denied.

22             The Court has made various rulings as it

23        relates to preemption, and that is the law that

24        is governing this case. With respect to

25        advertising, the Court did read the requested 4225

1        instruction by defense.

2             And with respect to the one other issue

3        that was taken up at sidebar that plaintiff had

4        raised, it was in the Noerr-Pennington

5        instruction that the Court had given at the

6        very inception of the case, and the Court had

7        included language there that read, "However,

8        false, misleading, or deceitful statements and

9        representations are not protected under the

10        First Amendment."

11              So the jury has heard that instruction and

12        has just now heard the instruction on freedom

13        of speech as it relates to commercial speech.

14             Are there any other issues other than the

15        motion for mistrial?

16             MR. HENK: Just a few housekeeping items.

17             On I believe it was July 16th, last

18        Friday, the defendants filed a renewed motion

19        for mistrial in writing, and I'm not sure that

20        we've gotten a ruling on that.

21              THE COURT: Well, the Court has always

22        ruled because you have always made your motions

23        oral first, orally first, and the Court has

24        ruled at that time, and then you always say

25        that you're going to submit it in writing. So 4226

1        I never have taken the position that I have to

2        issue another ruling. If there's any

3        uncertainty, however, there is no motion for

4        mistrial that I have granted. So to the extent

5        that you believe that the Court has not ruled

6        on a motion for mistrial, it is denied.

7             MR. HENK: Okay.

8             And then on the photographs, I believe we

9        had an agreement as to Philip Morris

10        composite A. I think we have an agreement on

11         that now, but I just want to make sure so that

12        we don't have to have the plaintiff testify in

13        our case in chief.

14             THE COURT: Is that the authenticity

15        issue?

16             MR. HENK: Yes.

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=66
17             THE COURT: So there was one that was left

18        out, correct?

19             MR. HENK: Well, and I also want to

20        clarify what the stipulation is as to the rest,

21         that these photographs in that composite

22        Exhibit PM-A, that all of them truly and

23        accurately depict Mr. Charles Piendle in each

24        of those photographs.

25             MR. SALES: They are what they are, there 4227

1        hasn't been any testimony about what's in them.

2        We're not raising authenticity objections. For

3        example, one picture I had a problem with, I've

4        never seen before. There were hundreds,

5        thousands of those, as counsel explained. I

6        couldn't identify the people.

7             THE COURT: Have you been able to since

8        that time?

9             MR. SALES: I don't have a problem with it

10        being admitted into evidence, but there's no

11         stipulation as to what's in it.

12             THE COURT: Are you stipulating as to that

13        one that you left aside as to its authenticity?

14             MR. SALES: Yes.

15             THE COURT: So all of the documents in

16        that exhibit have been stipulated to by

17        plaintiffs counsel as to authenticity, and as

18        I understand it, that was the only issue

19        relating to the stipulation, it was AA -- no,

20        PM-A, photos, parties agree to authenticity.

21              MR. HENK: As I'm hearing it, though,

22        your Honor, Mr. Sales is not agreeing that

23        these truly and accurately depict, in PM-A,

24        Mr. Charles Piendle, and it's his prerogative.

25        If he wants to take that position, we will have 4228

1        to go through the trouble, I'm not sure why he

2        wants us to, of putting the plaintiff on the

3        stand in our case in chief just to get her to

4        say that these photographs that they produced

5        to us, pursuant to a request for production

6        with respect to photographs of Charles Piendle,

7        actually show Charlie Piendle, but if that's

8        what they want us to do --

9             MR. SALES: Documents come into evidence,

10        and it doesn't mean that the parties tell the

11        jury what they mean.

12             THE COURT: Are you agreeing to the

13        admissibility?

14             MR. SALES: Yes.

15             THE COURT: Okay. So they're in evidence.

16             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

17        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Defense

18        Exhibit A.)

19             THE COURT: So what is the point? Are you

20        going to be using that in closing, for example,

21         to argue this is Mr. Piendle?

22             MR. HENK: As long as --

23             MR. KELLY: It shouldn't have to be an

24        argument.

25             THE COURT: I'm trying to understand what 4229

1        the practical effect of what you're asking the

2        Court. They are in evidence.

3             MR. HENK: Well, normally, your Honor,

4        what I would do is I would show the witness the

5        picture and say, does this truly and accurately

6        depict Charles Piendle, and the witness would

7        say yes.

8             THE COURT: You don't have to do that

9        because they're in evidence.

10             MR. HENK: Okay. As long as they're not

11         going to be contesting and saying, nobody said

12        that was Mr. Piendle.

13             THE COURT: Why would they do that?

14             MR. HENK: In closing, rebuttal closing.

15             MR. SALES: I am familiar with

16        circumstances, but one of Mr. Henk's partners

17        made an outrageous argument about what's in a

18        picture in a closing argument, and I'm going to

19        agree that anything that this lawyer says that

20        the pictures say, other than what they are.

21         They are what they are. We don't object to

22        their admission, but to have a stipulation

23        about what they show, that's his job.

24             THE COURT: Okay. Then with that, you can

25        do what you need to do. But they are in 4230

1         evidence without objection, which means you can

2        use them.

3             MR. HENK: We'll do what we have to do.

4             THE COURT: Any other matters ?

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I hesitate to rise. If

6        your Honor does not wish to do this at this

7        time, that's fine. There are a couple that are

8        sort of special.

9             THE COURT: I have taken a look at the -

10        and I've looked at all the case law that

11         everyone has provided to me on the --

12             MR. SCAROLA: Crime-fraud issue.

13             THE COURT: Yes, on the July 17th, 1963

14        document that's strictly private and

15        confidential. Has everyone been heard on that

16        issue?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think so, your Honor.

18        We did file two motions in limine with respect

19        to that -- if you want me to, I can identify

20        them for you -- that did brief this.

21              THE COURT: Well, I -- right. I've

22        reviewed everything. One of them is 34.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: 33 and 36.

24             THE COURT: 34 says, motion to exclude

25        HIPPO studies, you don't mean that. 4231

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: No, that one, you already

2        ruled on, your Honor.

3             THE COURT: So 33.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: And 36.

5             THE COURT: But that's not what we're

6        talking about with the July 17th, 1963 issue.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, we are, your Honor.

8        It is. That document falls within the scope of

9        both of those motions. One deals with

10        Congressman Bliley and the release that we

11         talked about earlier, and the other deals with

12        their theft by the first filed legal assistant

13        counsel for Brown & Williamson in Louisville,

14        Kentucky.

15             THE COURT: I'm sorry, you're saying 33

16        and 35 pertain to --

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: 33 and 36, by my count,

18        your Honor.

19             THE COURT: 36, okay. Yeah. All righty.

20        That's fine.

21              MR. SCAROLA: The only additional comment

22        I would make, which I'm not sure I did make, is

23        with respect to the Fourth District's decision

24        in American Tobacco vs. State, is that the

25        predicate to the Court in this case, our 4232

1        position the Court doesn't have to go through

2        all the analysis to determine whether or not

3        there was a crime or a fraud, because Engle

4        findings 4 and 5A tell us.

5             So I understand the plaintiff doesn't get

6        the benefit of it unless we meet our burden,

7        but the existence of such a crime or a fraud is

8        not a dispute for purposes of the issue, I

9        think, before the Court.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I think there

11         are additional objections to include 403, but

12        the threshold issue is what we stated. If

13        your Honor wishes to entertain at this time, I

14        will do that, but there are -- let me count

15        them.

16             THE COURT: Just going back to that

17        document, I have reviewed everything over the

18        break in terms of the document or having heard

19        the arguments, mindful of the Engle findings,

20        particularly as it relates to the two that

21         counsel just mentioned. And having considered

22        the American Tobacco vs -- Company vs. State

23        case, which is the Fourth D.C.A. case setting

24        forth the crime-fraud exception, and then the

25        other case that was provided to the Court which 4233

1        is the United States vs. Tobacco Free Kids,

2        et al., authored by Judge Kessler in the

3        District of Columbia in 2006 referencing the

4        specific finding that the Court made as to this

5        particular document, knowing that the Fourth

6        D.C.A. -- we're not clear if this document was

7        part of it, the Court is going to allow the

8        document to be used under the crime-fraud

9        exception. So that's that document.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: And the 403 objection,

11         your Honor?

12             THE COURT: Is overruled.

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: If you want to, we can

14        discuss just a handful of additional exhibits

15        at this time that present issues outside the

16        norm, there may be others that we'll identify

17        tonight, but if you want me to address those

18        briefly, I will; if not, that's fine, we can

19        reserve them and talk about them some other

20        time, it's your choice.

21              THE COURT: Well, do I have those

22        documents so I can take a look at them?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Well, the answer is yes

24        and no. The first one, I do not have before

25        me, it is slide 65, which is -- appears to be a 4234

1        videotaped excerpt from the deposition of

2        Mr. Heimann, who was a former executive of

3        American Tobacco Company that was taken in a

4        case in Texas.

5             THE COURT: So this is a video that's

6        contemplated to be used with Dr. Cummings?

7             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor, it is a

8        brief excerpt from that video deposition.

9             THE COURT: Okay. So-

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: My - I don't have the

11         transcript in front of me, your Honor.

12             THE COURT: You need Cummings' transcript?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: No, the transcript of the

14        Heimann deposition that's going to be played.

15        I suspect I know the excerpt where Mr. Heimann

16        is basically asked whether or not American

17        Tobacco Company intended the American public to

18        rely on statements, such as it's not proven

19        that smoking causes lung cancer. And he said,

20        yes, I suspect that's the answer.

21              MR. SALES: That's the one.

22             THE COURT: I need to break it down.

23        Sorry it's been a long day.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: I understand.

25            THE COURT: Who is the person testifying,

4235

1        Heimann?

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: Heimann, who was a former

3        executive of the American Tobacco Company.

4             THE COURT: Okay. So Heimann is

5        testifying in another lawsuit?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor.

7             THE COURT: And -

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: He is being deposed.

9             THE COURT: Yeah.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: And he is asked, did the

11         American Tobacco Company intend for the

12        American public to rely on statements to the

13        effect not proven. And he said, yes. And so

14        it would be reasonable to --1 can't remember

15        exactly. Here is my problem with the use of

16        this deposition.

17             Number one, there was a procedure that

18        your Honor adopted for identification of

19        witnesses and for designation of deposition

20        testimony that was not found with respect to

21         this particular excerpt.

22             Number 2 

23             THE COURT: I'm sorry, you're saying this

24        was not identified?

25             MR. BIERSTEKER: Mr. Heimann was not 4236

1        identified as a witness, and there were no

2        designations given from any of his depositions,

3        including this one. As you know, your Honor,

4        it was a very serious process, I have a whole

5        raft of designations that were made from

6        various witnesses. There's been no opportunity

7        to object, to counterdesignate, to do

8        anything --

9             THE COURT: He's not coming in as a

10        witness; is that correct? Maybe should I hear

11         how it is intended to come in first before I

12        hear the argument?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sure.

14             THE COURT: How are you intending to use a

15        clip of a deposition of an individual from the

16        American Tobacco Institute, who gave testimony

17        not in this case?

18             MR. SCAROLA: As -

19             MR. SALES: Can I explain this?

20             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, I'm sorry.

21              MR. SALES: The witness testified --1

22        don't want to preempt counsel -- but the

23        witness testified in a tobacco and health case

24        in Mississippi.

25             THE COURT: Okay. 4237

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=71
1              MR. SALES: And the witness had been,

2        according to counsel, the head of American

3        Tobacco. What your Honor may not remember is

4        that American Tobacco was acquired by

5        Brown & Williamson, which later merged with

6        R.J. Reynolds, and it's a stipulated jury

7        instruction that Mr. Biersteker's client buys

8        the farm, respectfully, with respect to

9        American Tobacco.

10             THE COURT: So Mr. Heimann made a

11         statement at some point when he was affiliated

12        with an entity that has ultimately merged with

13        Reynolds.

14             MR. SCAROLA: Counsel's position is this

15        is the testimony as elicited and provided in

16        the exhibit in advance of trial as part of our

17        submission. I don't think there's a dispute

18        about that, it's PIE284. It was not only on

19        our big list, but it was on our slimmed down

20        list of 400 something. Your Honor will have

21         some memory of that. So this is an exhibit.

22             It's true that it's testimony. The

23        portion that's intended to be read, as counsel

24        clearly knows and has indicated, is a

25        well-known portion. And counsel's other 4238

1         objection, as I understand it, is going to be

2        that Mr. Heimann, at the time he gave the

3        testimony, was no longer running the company,

4        and what we have done is -- you're not going to

5        get onboard on that one?

6             THE COURT: You can speak to how you're

7        going to use it, and then I'll hear what he has

8        to say.

9             MR. SALES: We're going to speak to an

10        admission on the part of a coconspirator, now

11         absorbed by a party to this case, that the

12        industry, at least this entity, intended for

13        the public to rely on the public statements of

14        the company with respect to the issues of

15        smoking and health and their advertising.

16             THE COURT: So you're proposing that it

17        comes in as an admission and presumably this

18        witness has relied upon this admission in

19        rendering his opinion?

20             MR. SCAROLA: Exactly, yes, your Honor.

21              THE COURT: Okay. So what is the

22        objection?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: There is a procedural

24        objection first, that I believe that prior

25        testimony in deposition should have been --4239

1        that Mr. Heimann should have been listed as a

2        witness, there should have been a designation

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=72
3        of his deposition, because clearly they're

4        playing it for the very same purpose it was

5        before.

6             THE COURT: It was listed as an exhibit.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: It was on their exhibit

8        list, okay, fine.

9             Second objection with respect to this

10        document, although it is true that Mr. Heimann,

11         at the time of his testimony, was no longer

12        employed by American Tobacco Company, it's not

13        that, it is this: There is a finding, your

14        Honor. The finding is, and you read it to the

15        ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that the

16        defendants concealed information and agreed to

17        conceal information with the intent that the

18        American public relied upon it to their

19        detriment.

20             So, respectfully, you have ruled in your

21         motions in limine that they are not allowed to

22        introduce evidence relating to the findings,

23        that's exactly what this is, Mr. Heimann's

24        testimony. To the extent that this testimony

25        is anything other than an effort to introduce 4240

1         evidence with respect to the finding, it

2        relates to a claim for affirmative fraud, which

3        is not in the case, there's no other purpose.

4             THE COURT: What finding are you saying?

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Both findings, the fact

6        that because as the successor to American

7        Tobacco Company, my client is responsible for

8        their acts. So it comes in under both, and I

9        think it was four and five.

10             THE COURT: Four is concealment and five

11         is the agreement.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Exactly, but both of them

13        say that the defendants omitted information

14        about the health risks of smoking and the

15        addictiveness of smoking with the intent that

16        the American public relied to their detriment,

17        or words to that effect. And so introducing

18        evidence to establish something that is already

19        established by the finding that your Honor has

20        read to the jury would be highly prejudicial

21         and improper under your Honor's own rulings and

22        the motions in limine.

23             As I understand it, plaintiffs do not have

24        a claim and are not asserting a claim for

25        straight fraud, other than concealment. And so 4241

1        to the extent that it cannot relate to any

2        other issue in the case other than the

3        findings, then it's improper.

4             THE COURT: Okay. What is the response?

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=73
5             MR. SALES: The response is that Engle

6        leaves your Honor and the jury with two things

7        to decide, it's our position, at least, one is

8        the nexus, however we're going to define that

9        and we don't agree, but we have those rules

10        between what the defendants did in the Engle

11         findings and the death in this case, that's it.

12             And B, and part of A, is comparative

13        fault. One of the things that the defendants

14        are saying is that it was all Mr. Piendle's

15        fault. Would it be fair and reasonable and, in

16        fact, incumbent upon the Court to permit the

17        jury to hear what the industry executives, in

18        this instance, Mr. Heimann, himself had to say

19        about whether it would be reasonable for

20        someone to believe what the company was saying.

21         One of the things about these cases,

22        your Honor --

23             THE COURT: Well, is it suggested that

24        Mr. Piendle heard this comment?

25             MR. SALES: No. No, it is not known that 4242

1        he heard that comment. He certainly didn't

2        read the deposition. No one is suggesting

3        that. All of the case of both parties is

4        inferential in this regard, your Honor. The

5        defendants say he must have known because it

6        was in newspapers, he must have known because

7        he learned it in school, he must have known for

8        all these other reasons, even though they say

9        themselves, we have no reason to believe that

10        lung cancer was caused by our product.

11              And on the plaintiffs side, and as you've

12        heard today, the plaintiffs position is it's

13        important for the jury to know, and this is the

14        way these cases are being tried everywhere, the

15        entirety of the context of public statements,

16        pro and con, in the controversy.

17             The defendants take the position

18        simultaneously in this case, that they were

19        justified in saying what they said, that

20        cigarettes didn't cause cancer, but that

21         Mr. Piendle should have known everything he

22        needed to know.

23             Now, it is fair and reasonable for the

24        jury to be asked, in a case like this, what an

25        executive was saying about the import of 4243

1        reliability of the company's public statements,

2        and that those statements are the same

3        statements that Dr. Cummings has talked about.

4             There is no reasonable basis to say --

5        this has nothing to do with peaking behind 4 or

6        5A, this is a question straight up. What we're

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=74
7        left with with Engle, was it reasonable for

8        Mr. Piendle to behave the way that he behaved

9        when the company itself, at least one of

10        Mr. Biersteker's predecessor clients, when the

11         company itself was saying that that was

12        reasonable conduct. That's what the testimony

13        is.

14             THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, I am

15        going to allow it. I will be willing to

16        give -- we do have an instruction on Engle

17        findings, so if anyone, as with the Williams

18        and any other instruction wants that given,

19        they are to ask the Court, but I do when this

20        issue was raised about potentially something

21         coming in that may be evidence of timing, which

22        is not permitted, I have thread that limiting

23        instruction, at least once, and I would do it

24        again if requested, but I will allow that video

25        clip to be shown to this witness. 4244

1             What is the next issue?

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: There are two exhibits,

3        I'm going off Mr. Scarola's PowerPoint slide,

4        so it would be slide 66, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Is this the packet that was

6        provided to me, this packet?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor. Slide

8        66 and 67.

9             THE COURT: Okay. Where is that number?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Numbered at the bottom,

11         depends on how yours is clipped.

12             THE COURT: 66 is this one right here?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor. This is

14        a letter from R.J. Reynolds, public information

15        public relations department to the principal of

16        an elementary school, responding to the

17        principal concerning a letter -- a series of

18        letters that students had written. And there

19        is a like letter in the next exhibit?

20             THE COURT: Which number?

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: Well, slide 67, your

22        Honor, the underlying exhibits are PT1433 and

23        PT1252. Both of these are well after the time

24        period. One of them is 1990, well after the

25        time period when Mr. Piendle was in elementary 4245

1         school. He didn't attend elementary school, in

2        any event, in Amherst, New York, which the

3        first letter is, or in Tacoma, Washington, the

4        second letter is. There is no nexus whatever

5        to him. This is highly prejudicial evidence

6        and should not come in absent nexus. And I

7        would object to both of these exhibits, PT1433

8        and PT1252, on that basis, among others.

9             THE COURT: Okay. Response.

10             MR. SCAROLA: The same misrepresentations

11         that were being made in the 1950s to children

12        that misled them to begin smoking continued to

13        be made both in 1990 and in 1968,

14        misrepresentations directly to children.

15             THE COURT: Okay.

16             MR. SCAROLA: Do I need to say more, your

17        Honor?

18             THE COURT: No. I will allow it in, but

19        again it would be -- if requested -- in the

20        Court's opinion, it clearly falls within the

21        Williams instruction. So upon request, this

22        document would be appropriate to have that

23        instruction read, that is that it's -- it's to

24        be considered regarding the -- if -- well, the

25        reprehensibility issue. I don't have to read 4246

1        the whole thing again.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, if I may, if

3        you've ruled and you want me to be quiet, I

4        will. If I may --

5             MR. SCAROLA: Do I get a vote?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: You don't get a vote.

7             If I may, there has been no evidence that

8        Mr. Piendle was in school when any letter like

9        this was every written, nevermind to

10        Mr. Piendle's school, nor that he relied upon

11         such a statement. That evidence is a

12        predicate, even under the Williams rationale,

13        and that nexus, your Honor, I don't think has

14        been established.

15             MR. HENK: May I add, your Honor, I just

16        heard counsel, plaintiffs counsel, state this

17        all goes to misrepresentation, and we've gone

18        over this issue many times, and I believe

19        your Honor has sustained objections to evidence

20        that pertains to affirmative fraud claims

21        because there are no affirmative fraud claims

22        in this case, and the Engle findings on such

23        claims were --

24             THE COURT: The nexus the Court is

25        referring to is testimony and evidence that's 4247

1         already been elicited with respect to

2        allegations of misrepresentation in the link

3        between smoking and medical issues, and so that

4        is the nexus. And these two documents appear

5        to speak to that same issue, albeit -- albeit

6        outside the time frame, at least the 1990, and

7        I suppose the 1968 as it relates to any type of

8        youth issues.

9             But the Court finds that the issues have

10        the necessary nexus but that certainly it can't

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=76
11        be considered for the harm to others, but only

12        as to arguments that plaintiff is making with

13        respect to punitive damages and

14        reprehensibility. So that is the nexus that

15        the Court finds persuasive to allow it to come

16        in, but subject to an instruction if requested.

17             Any other issues?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yeah, I did have a 403

19        objection to that one as well. To these two,

20        your Honor, I assumed you'll overrule that as

21         well at this point.

22             THE COURT: That will be overruled.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Just one other thing I

24        wanted to flag, so that counsel can correct if

25        it is an issue, I haven't actually ascertained 4248

1        whether it is with respect to the videos he

2        intends to play, certain testimony before

3        Congress.

4             I do know that Plaintiff Exhibit PT3862,

5        which is on the list for Dr. Cummings, but not

6        encompassed in the slides that you intend to

7        use, in fact, is a transcript, a video

8        transcript of hearings before Congress that

9        was -- that were doctored by thetruth.com

10        inserting little bubbles over the executive's

11         head, saying things like "one smoker dies every

12         15 minutes."

13             MR. SCAROLA: We are not playing any

14        bubbles.

15             THE COURT: Okay.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have a question about

17         1771, and I haven't had a chance to view it

18        yet.

19             MR. SCAROLA: We'll show you the actual

20        clips that will be played whenever you would

21         like to see them.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: That would be helpful. I

23        just had a concern about that. I didn't want

24        to derail my presentation that I do need to do

25        the rest of my homework on this one, but I 4249

1        wanted to raise it as a potential special

2        issue.

3             THE COURT: You'll make sure plaintiff

4        counsel sees the clip.

5             MR. SCAROLA: I think that we may have

6        already -- have we e-mailed that clip to them.

7             UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: What I'd like do is

8        hand it to them right now.

9             THE COURT: Let's talk about my favorite

10        subject, scheduling.

11              MR. KELLY: Can I raise an exhibit issue,

12        your Honor?

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=77
13             THE COURT: Okay.

14             MR. KELLY: I haven't had a chance to take

15        a look at the videos because my computer is

16        still in Germany, and the one that I was given

17        doesn't have any software on it to read these

18        kinds of files.

19             THE COURT: When you say the video, you

20        mean --

21              MR. KELLY: The video exhibits. There's a

22        whole, I don't know, dozen or so video exhibits

23        among those listed, and I have the np4 file,

24        but this computer that I have won't open them,

25        but I will take a look at them tonight. 4250

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2             MR. KELLY: One of them is identified "a

3        death in the west," I believe, and that was

4        subject, my memory is, to an in limine motion

5        that had been deferred. I want to flag that

6        for your Honor, we need to talk about it

7        tomorrow, once I had a chance to see what the

8        excerpt looks like.

9             THE COURT: Here it is, it's 37. Denying

10        in part is moot and deferring ruling on you

11         have to exclude death in the west. So, yes,

12        the excerpts need to be specified. You will

13        then have an opportunity to object, and then

14        I'll need to see them.

15             MR. KELLY: Exactly. We need to go

16        through that process. Then with respect to

17        other videos, I'll certainly raise that in the

18        morning if there's an issue. I thought what

19        I'd do with respect to the written documents

20        that have been provided, that I would submit to

21         you in the morning a written objection on each

22        of the exhibits, so that while a foundation is

23        being laid for them, perhaps you can review the

24        objections that we're making, and after the

25        foundation has been laid, you can rule on the 4251

1         objection. That might be a way to move things

2        along.

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I'm always in favor of

5        moving things along.

6             MR. KELLY: I'll do that tonight, and I'll

7        give everybody a copy tomorrow. And then if I

8        come across something that I think we need to

9        talk about it, I'll raise it first thing.

10             THE COURT: How--what are we

11         anticipating with the remainder of plaintiffs

12        examination of Dr. Cummings?

13             MR. SCAROLA: A few more hours.

14             THE COURT: So by lunchtime?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=78
15             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think so,

16        your Honor. No, I don't think I'll be finished

17        by lunchtime. I think I'll be finished by

18        midafternoon.

19             MR. KELLY: 3:00, 3:30?

20             THE COURT: What is today?

21              MR. SALES: It's a happy day, and we're

22        all in happy mode.

23             THE COURT: No, today is your last day of

24        trial. Tomorrow is your spillover day. So

25        we -- you are spilling. 4252

1              MR. SALES: I think after Jack and I had a

2        chance -- Mr. Scarola and I had a chance to

3        meet this morning about what his plan with

4        Dr. Cummings is, I don't think we'll need

5        Dr. Farone, so we can jettison that. I

6        apologize to the Court. You understand we're

7        all doing --

8             THE COURT: No, that's fine. I didn't go

9        any further yesterday.

10             And then what are you anticipating for

11         cross?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: This one is going to be,

13        I think, the same length of Dr. Burns, if I had

14        to guess.

15             MR. KELLY: Day, day and a half.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yeah, I just don't --

17             MR. KELLY: What he's laid out over 30

18        years, to unwind is going to take a long time.

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm hoping it's shorter

20        than that, your Honor, to be honest. For my

21         own part, I was thinking three or four hours

22        just for me. It could very well be less,

23        because I like to try to keep crosses shorter

24        rather than longer. But I think the three to

25        four estimate for me, personally, would be an 4253

1         appropriate estimate.

2             THE COURT: Okay. Well, given I ruled on,

3        I think at least most of the issues that you

4        have highlighted, subject to your review,

5        Mr. Kelly, of these video clips, and I would

6        anticipate we should be able to go smoothly. I

7        think it would be helpful if plaintiffs

8        counsel can again, so as to avoid the kinds of

9        objections we had today, bite size questions so

10        we can get bite size responses. So if there's

11         a particular objection, we can address it

12        narrowly.

13             I guess I would like to put it out there

14        as a goal to have the direct finished by lunch

15        hour. I'd like to see direct finished by lunch

16        hour, and R.J.'s cross finished by the end of

17        tomorrow, so on Friday, which is a defense day,

18        they finish up with Cummings, and then you

19        bring in your first witness, so you can begin

20        your case on Friday, that's really . . .

21              MR. KELLY: I think as it stands right

22        now, we have one witness on Friday. We thought

23        we'd do Dr. Farone, that that would cover our

24        time. Now that looks like that won't be

25        happening. So we may not fill up all of Friday 4254

1        with our witness. So maybe if it does go over

2        a little bit.

3             MR. BARNHART: Who is your witness on

4        Friday?

5             MR. SALES: Since you know who it is.

6             MR. KELLY: Isn't today Wednesday?

7             THE COURT: Well, if you know who it is.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Dr. Riddel.

9             MR. KELLY: Maybe.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: There's some divergence

11         of opinion as to who the first expert --

12             THE COURT: But you don't think that's a

13        full day, he's a half day?

14             MR. KELLY: Yep.

15             THE COURT: So that should be the goal, to

16        follow that.

17             MR. HENK: Just to foreworn, and I'll be

18        happy to provide a transcript from the last

19        trial in which plaintiffs counsel presented

20        Dr. Cummings. There's an issue on

21         cross-examination of answering the question

22        that's asked, and I won't say anything more

23        than that. I know they would probably dispute

24        that. I would be happy to provide you with the

25        transcript of the last trial and see what the 4255

1        judge -- how the judge handled it there, but

2        it's an issue in terms of the length of the

3        cross examination.

4             THE COURT: Okay. In other words, your

5        experience is there have been lengthy

6        responses?

7             MR. HENK: Nonresponsive, working in all

8        kinds of.

9             THE COURT: I do think the shorter the

10        questions, maybe the shorter the answer. So if

11         everyone can look at how the questions are

12        framed too, and maybe with your experience with

13        this witness that will assist in the process.

14             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much,

15        your Honor.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you for your time.

17             THE COURT: We'll see you at 9:30 or

18        earlier tomorrow morning.

22 23 24 25               CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

24     BY MR. SCAROLA:

25        Q.   Dr. Cummings, we left off yesterday 4267

1   talking about the tobacco industry's conscious

2   manipulation of public opinion, and I want to

3   continue talking about that same general subject

4   matter. But begin if you would, please, by telling

5   us whether from the perspective of your expertise

6   the concept of cognitive dissonance has any meaning

7   to you.

8        A.   Sure.

9        Q.   Describe if you would, please, to the

10   ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what cognitive

11    dissonance is and why it is of significance with

12   regard to the topic that we've been discussing.

13        A.   Well, cognitive dissonance is a theory

14   that is used in psychology to try to understand

15   people's behavior, and essentially it says that

16   people have tension when they have conflicting

17   beliefs, smoking is bad for your health, I enjoy

18   smoking, I get pleasure from smoking. And these are

19   in conflict as -- particularly as information comes

20   out about the dangers of smoking, it influences and

21    it has been used to study people's decisions about

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=84
22   their smoking, such as making quit attempts and

23   ultimately in quitting.

24             And what we have found, because I have

25   actually done research and have published studies on 4268

1    cognitive dissonance in smokers, is smokers tend to

2   discount the risks of smoking relative to nonsmokers

3   or former smokers. Former smokers, people who used

4   to be smokers, who've quit, if you follow them,

5   their beliefs about the dangers of smoking and the

6   benefits of not smoking tend to shift after they

7   quit. So when they're smoking, they tend to

8   underestimate those risks. When they basically quit

9   smoking, their beliefs shift, and if they relapse

10   back to smoking, they essentially go back to the

11   beliefs that they had originally, in other words, to

12   try to, you know, satisfy the psychic tension that

13   exists in their head between the conflicting beliefs

14   that smoking is bad for your health, it's harming

15   them, versus they are smoking, they enjoy it.

16             And it, in fact, relates to a lot of the

17   public relations efforts that I talked about from

18   the industry, which in a sense was a way of trying

19   to sway public opinion to give people a

20   psychological crutch and self-rationale to keep

21    smoking.

22        Q.   You're anticipating my next question, and

23   I do want to get there, but before we get to that

24   point, is this choice that is being made a conscious

25   and voluntary choice to believe one thing rather 4269

1   than another in a cognitively dissonant setting?

2             MR. KELLY: I'm going to object,

3        your Honor, on the grounds that Dr. Cummings

4        has not established a foundation in the field

5        of psychology or psychiatry, based upon his

6        education.

7             THE COURT: You can lay a foundation.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   Dr. Cummings, you said that this is an

10   area that you have personally conducted research in,

11    correct?

12        A.   Not only conducted research, I've taught

13   it to graduate students for the last 25 years. It's

14   the area in my formal training in health behavior.

15   A major part of that was understanding the various

16   theories, both psychological theories, sociological

17   theories, social psychology, as well as actually

18   with tobacco you get into the effects of

19   pharmacology and the effects of drug on the brain.

20   So that's been the area of my training, my research,

21    my teaching. I've written on this topic in a

22   variety of places, as I said.

23        Q.   Now, based upon -- based upon that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=85
24   education, training and experience, when conflicting

25   messages are received by a smoker, is a smoker 4270

1   making a conscious choice, an informed decision

2   about which of those messages are going to be

3   perceived as persuasive and which of them are going

4   to be rejected?

5        A.   Well, conscious choice, they're weighing

6   the information that's in the environment, and the

7   amount of information certainly begins to affect the

8   psychic tension. An addicted smoker tends to

9   discount the information because there's another

10   factor that's driving their behavior, which is their

11    nicotine dependence.

12             So what we find is the factors that

13   predict whether somebody makes a quit attempt,

14   trying to actually change their smoking, the

15   information environment is important to them, but

16   the factors that predict whether people can quit and

17   stay off cigarettes are largely dictated by their

18   biology, how addicted they are to cigarettes, and by

19   the design of the product that maintains their

20   nicotine dependence, and that is out of their

21    control.

22        Q.   Is the recognition of the concept of

23   cognitive dissonance of recent vintage? Is this

24   knowledge that science has only recently developed?

25        A.   No. Cognitive dissonance theory was first 4271

1   written about back in the '50s. Fessinger was the

2   psychologist who sort of coined the term "cognitive

3   dissonance theory." So it's been taught to basic

4   Psych 101 students for almost 50 or 60 years.

5        Q.   Do the internal documents of the tobacco

6   industry which you have examined reflect an

7   understanding within the industry of the concept of

8   cognitive dissonance?

9             MR. KELLY: Calls for interpretation,

10        your Honor.

11              THE COURT: Overruled, consistent with the

12        ruling yesterday.

13        A.   Yes.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Going how far back in time?

16        A.   Back to the 1950s.

17        Q.   Did that understanding, in your expert

18   opinion, influence advertising, marketing, cigarette

19   design within the tobacco industry?

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, compound.

21      BY MR. SCAROLA:

22        Q.   I'll break it down. I'll ask three

23   questions.

24             Did that understanding and recognition of

25   the way cognitive dissonance works, particularly in

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=86
4272

1    smokers, influence the tobacco industry's

2   advertising strategy?

3             MR. KELLY: Calls for speculation,

4        your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Overruled.

6        A.   Yes.

7     BY MR. SCAROLA:

8        Q.   Did it influence their marketing strategy?

9             MR. KELLY: Same objection, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: Overruled.

11         A.   Yes, it did.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   Did it influence the design of cigarettes?

14             MR. KELLY: Same objection, your Honor.

15             THE COURT: Overruled.

16        A.   It did.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Did the documents that you have examined

19   reflect that influence?

20             MR. KELLY: Calls for interpretation of

21         the documents, your Honor.

22             THE COURT: Overruled.

23        A.   Yes.

24     BY MR. SCAROLA:

25        Q.   And are you prepared, during the course of 4273

1   your testimony today, to show us documents

2   reflecting how the industry's perception of the way

3   cognitive dissonance works played a role in each of

4   those areas?

5        A.   Yes, and how successful they were.

6        Q.   I think that you told us yesterday that

7   your document review has included a rather

8   comprehensive review of cigarette advertising,

9   correct?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   Has that included both print advertising

12   and television advertising?

13        A.   That's right. I have collected not only

14   just print, but billboard, point of sale,

15   promotional items, coupons, as well as TV and radio

16   advertising as part of my research.

17        Q.   Based upon your review of tens of

18   thousands of cigarette ads and marketing materials,

19   how many industry-produced ads will you be able to

20   show us that depict a smoker with an uncontrolled

21    hacking cough?

22        A.   Zero.

23        Q.   Have you ever seen one?

24        A.   No.

25        Q.   Based upon your review of tens of 4274

1   thousands of advertisements and marketing materials

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=87
2   generated from the tobacco industry, how many of

3   those advertisements will show a smoker struggling

4   to gasp for air with emphysema or COPD?

5        A.   Zero.

6        Q.   Have you ever seen one that did that?

7        A.   Not a cigarette ad.

8        Q.   How many industry-produced ads or

9   marketing materials depict a smoker exhibiting the

10   hair loss, weight loss and nausea commonly

11    associated with chemo and radiation treatments for

12   cancer?

13        A.   I've never seen one.

14        Q.   How many show smokers with surgical scars

15   from radical surgery made necessary as a consequence

16   of smoking-related disease?

17        A.   No.

18        Q.   How many cigarette advertisements over the

19   tens of thousands that you have looked at show

20   smokers exhibiting the physical and emotional

21    effects of nicotine withdrawal?

22        A.   None.

23        Q.   What is, just from an overview

24   perspective, the theme of cigarette advertising?

25             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor, 4275

1         overbroad as to time.

2             MR. SCAROLA: I'll break it down.

3             MR. KELLY: Thank you.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   In the 1950s, what was the theme, the

6   general theme or themes of cigarette advertising?

7        A.   There were a number of themes. The

8   general themes, particularly in the 1950s, was over

9   the safety of smoking, often using doctors, more

10   doctors smoke certain brands than others, that was a

11    common theme.

12             Holiday themes were commonly used with

13   cigarettes packaged in holiday themes for Christmas

14   or Father's Day.

15             You had a theme of high technology with

16   the introduction of filters to remove irritants from

17   the smoke as a major concern, that was reflected was

18   you could get good taste with a filtered cigarette

19   that would remove tars in the cigarettes. And that

20   had a major impact on people's behavior, as you saw

21   people shifting from unfiltered cigarettes, which

22   was over 90 percent of the market in the early

23    1950s, and that changed dramatically by the end of

24   the 1950s.

25             Sex appeal, boy and girls together, fun, 4276

1    sexy, appealing, heros, athletes. These were

2   commonly reflected in the marketing campaigns of the

3   defendants during the 1950s, often portrayed with a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=88
4   war theme particularly with -- following

5   World War II with handing out free cartons of

6   cigarettes to the soldiers in VA hospitals.

7             This was often tagged onto many of the

8   popular TV shows of the day in the 1950s, TV

9   becoming a very important component, 9 percent of

10   households in the early '50s had television, by the

11    end of the decade it was 87 percent, and the

12   defendants basically dominated the television

13   market.

14        Q.   Have you formed an opinion, based upon all

15   of the work that you have done in this area -- well,

16   actually, before I get to that question, we talked

17   about the 1950s. Was there any significant change

18   in those advertising themes in the 1960s?

19        A.   Well, the biggest change in the 1960s was

20   a shift following 1964 with the Surgeon General's

21    report to the introduction of low-tar cigarettes.

22   So it was filters, really, in the 1950s and early

23   '60s, and beginning in the -- you know, late 1960s

24   and into the 1970s, there was a theme towards lower

25   tar and nicotine, so really focusing on the tar and 4277

1   nicotine levels being different in different brands,

2   which was something that became a little bit more

3   common after the 1964 report.

4             There was an increased emphasis on

5   television advertising in the 1960s. Sixty of the

6   most popular shows on television were sponsored by

7   cigarette companies, so that was still a major

8   theme.

9             And the notion of independence,

10   risk-taking, the cowboy with a -- Marlboro cowboy

11    was introduced in 1962, and that was sort of an

12   iconic image for Marlboro, and that really took

13   place after a variety of different advertising

14   themes that were used by Philip Morris in the 1950s,

15   and switched over to the cowboy theme in 1962.

16        Q.   Did they continue, that is, did the

17   industry continue to employ the endorsements of

18   celebrities, entertainers and sports figures to

19   promote their products?

20             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that's overbroad,

21         "the industry," and not specific as to the

22        defendant or the company.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Or time.

24             THE COURT: Okay. I'll have you rephrase. 25

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   We are focusing on the 1960s at this

3   point, and I would like to know whether as a general

4   matter, the advertising themes employed by the

5   tobacco industry, and we'll get to the specific

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimo^pgNbr=89
6   defendants in just a moment, the advertising themes

7   of the tobacco industry in general continued to

8   employ the endorsement of celebrities, entertainment

9   figures, sports figures in their advertising?

10        A.   Yes.

11         Q.   Were either of these defendants an

12   exception to that general employment of celebrities,

13   movie stars, radio and TV stars, although I guess by

14   the 1960s, we're talking less about radio stars, and

15   other -- other celebrities for purposes of endorsing

16   their products?

17        A.   No, there wasn't an exception. It was

18   very common to use athletes. Many sports teams were

19   sponsored. Their advertising for football and

20   baseball had the defendants sponsoring their

21    advertising around those themes.

22             Advertising was placed on TV around, say,

23   NFL football Sunday, it was very common to see those

24   advertisements appearing on the shows. You also saw

25   that integrated with the large billboards, usually 4279

1    around the scoreboards that would show up on the

2   television screen, as well, to those watching on TV.

3             As I said, 60 of the television shows of

4   the era of the 1960s were sponsored by cigarette

5   companies. Virtually every American was exposed to

6   cigarette advertising. It was impossible not to be

7   exposed to it.

8             A lot of the advertising in the '60s was

9   on filtered cigarettes because that had become the

10   dominant cigarette design feature. So there was a

11    lot of advertising talking about the special

12   filtration of the cigarette, as well as the special

13   filter blend, and again, this was incorporated into

14   a variety of media, television, radio, billboards,

15   point of sale, newspaper, magazine, advertising. It

16   was ubiquitous, the companies were among the major

17   advertisers in the country at that time.

18        Q.   We've covered the '50s and the '60s.

19   Let's go to the '70s. Were there any significant

20   changes in terms of advertising and marketing by the

21    tobacco industry in the 1970s?

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, preemption,

23        your Honor.

24             THE COURT: Overruled.

25        A.   Themes were similar, but the medium was 4280

1    different. Cigarette advertising went off

2   television and radio in 1971, and so there was a

3   shift where those dollars went, and they went

4   primarily into specialty magazines, men's and

5   women's magazines, so a major push there.

6             Promotional advertising became very

7   popular at that time with the introduction of

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=90
8   sponsorship particularly of sports. So the

9   defendants sponsored Virginia Slims tennis, you had

10   NASCAR, which was Winston, you had Marlboro racing.

11    And this was a common feature. Off of television,

12   there was an increased amount of product placements

13   put in movies at that time.

14             So there was a shift from, you know,

15   showing television -- you know, because you couldn't

16   advertise on TV, so the integration there with

17   television shows really switched over to movies. So

18   you saw particularly one of the defendants

19   advertising, you know, product placements with their

20   brand showing up in popular movies of the era where

21    they would pay for that placement. Of course, you

22   wouldn't know that that's what was happening, but

23   that is something not only cigarette companies did

24   but other companies as well. 25

4281

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Are you going to be able during the course

3   of your testimony today to show us an example of

4   that happening?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   That is, product placement in popular

7   movies that was not disclosed?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   All right, sir.

10        A.   There was also an emphasis towards product

11    sampling going on. So in this area --

12        Q.   What does that mean, what does "product

13   sampling" mean?

14        A.   They hand out free samples, and typically

15   would do it around spring breaks. So Florida was a

16   big area where -- because a lot of young people come

17   down to Florida during spring break time and there

18   were large, integrated promotions of free sampling

19   around the beaches and also promotions available,

20   like giving out beach towels, T-shirts, often using,

21    again, popular, you know, individuals, particularly

22   in the music industry, to help promote different

23   cigarette brands.

24        Q.   We now move to the '80s. Can you give us

25   an overview as to whether there were any significant 4282

1    changes in the way in which the tobacco industry was

2   advertising and marketing its products in the 1980s

3   as compared to the '50s, '60s, and '70s, which we

4   now discussed?

5        A.   In the 1980s, the themes shifted more

6   towards more low tar in the '70s, so real emphasis

7   on low-tar brands, and that continued into the

8    1980s. So literally, a competition to who had the

9   best-tasting, low-tar cigarette, which involved

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=91
10   through marketing the product design, which was

11   primarily achieved through filter ventilation, the

12   insertion of invisible vent holes in the filter tip

13   that would make it easier to draw bigger, deeper

14   puffs, didn't change exposures people got, but the

15   advertising gave people the illusion that they were

16   getting less tar and nicotine. That was a major

17   theme.

18             There was also, because of the

19   demographics of the baby boom that had grown up in

20   the '60s and the 70s, they were aging and then you

21    saw an emphasis on their first brand selection,

22   because there was a lot of brand loyalty to the

23   popular brands with young people in the '60s and

24   70s beginning to, you know, shift to some of these

25   low-tar varieties of brands. So there was the 4283

1   introduction of new brands. Merit was one of those

2   brands. Doral was introduced in the 1970s as a

3   low-tar brand and continued into the early '80s.

4             And then some of the companies started

5   offering cigarettes with price discounting and that

6   was a new part of the marketing mix that began to

7   appear in the 1980s with the introduction of, you

8   know, 25 cigarettes in a pack was a way of getting

9   five extra packs. Longer cigarettes, which was a

10   way of selling people, the idea that they were

11    getting extra value for their money, and then

12   actually branded discounts of products, and there

13   was a major competition to replenish young people in

14   the '80s. So the new replacement smokers to come in

15   and replace the older smokers who were quitting or

16   dying, because there was an increase in smoking

17   cessation occurring in the 1980s.

18        Q.   What was the industry's message about why

19   low tar made a difference? What -- why were they

20   promoting low-tar cigarettes?

21              MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor,

22        calls --

23             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, that question is

24        not properly phrased. Let me restate it. 25

4284

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   What was the industry's message about low

3   tar?

4        A.   Less tar and nicotine for good taste is

5   essentially the theme that was, you know, marketed

6   and people believed that theme, and the expectation

7   was that people would believe it, even though they

8   didn't get less tar and nicotine. When you measure

9   the amount of tar and nicotine that somebody

10   actually gets in their system, there was no

11    difference between the full flavor regular

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=92
12   cigarettes and the low-tar cigarettes, and so -- but

13   people certainly believed there was a difference.

14             And I've done a fair amount of research on

15   that topic to look at people's perceptions about it

16   and the people who were more concerned about the

17   risks of smoking tended to be the ones who were

18   shifting over to low tar, and because their

19   perception they would get less tar and nicotine, a

20   lot of folks thought that maybe switching would help

21    them eventually quit, which wasn't true because they

22   weren't really getting less nicotine.

23        Q.   While I am remembering to do this, you

24   mentioned American Tobacco yesterday, what is the

25   relationship of American Tobacco to either of the 4285

1    defendants in this courtroom?

2        A.   Well, American Tobacco was one of the

3   major cigarette companies, and they were bought by

4   R.J. Reynolds in the 1990s. So it's Reynolds

5   American Tobacco today.

6        Q.   And what were the brands that American

7   Tobacco was manufacturing back in the '50s, '60s,

8   '70s, '80s?

9        A.   Well, the big brand in the 1950s was Lucky

10   Strikes. As I said, Lucky Strikes was probably the

11    most popular or was the most popular brand among

12   young people. It was also a popular brand among

13   adults, but had a higher share of the market among

14   teenagers in the early 1950s.

15        Q.   You talked about the success that the

16   tobacco industry acknowledged that it had had in

17   influencing persons in Charlie Piendle's age group

18   in the late '50s and the statistical confirmation of

19   that success from the standpoint that seven out of

20   ten people in Charlie Piendle's cohort started

21    smoking during that period of time.

22             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is a summary

23        form of questioning, which is argumentative in

24        form and it should not be done at this stage.

25             THE COURT: Okay. Consistent with 4286

1        yesterday's ruling, sustained.

2             Reask the question.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   What evidence exists -- have you formed an

5   opinion, based upon your experience, your training,

6   and your expertise, as to whether it would have made

7   a difference to that age cohort, persons of

8   Charlie's age, during the late 1950s, in terms of

9   their smoking decisions, if all of the information

10   known to the tobacco companies, known to the tobacco

11    industry was accurately provided to that age group

12   at that time?

13             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. It's

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=93
14        uncertain and calls for speculation from this

15        witness.

16             THE COURT: Overruled. The witness can

17        answer the question, I'll allow it.

18        A.   Yes, I have an opinion about that.

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Tell us, please, what that opinion is.

21         A.   My opinion is it would have made a huge

22   difference. You can't make an informed choice if

23   you don't have the information. If information is

24   concealed, then you can't use it to base decisions

25   upon and -- so that is -- it would make a difference 4287

1   not only for individual consumers, but it would make

2   a difference for the public health and medical

3   community that was charged with protecting the

4   public's health, and that information was concealed

5   from them as well.

6             MR. KELLY: Move to strike, your Honor, as

7        nonresponsive, the last portion of that answer.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I think it's exactly

9        responsive, your Honor. And in addition to

10        that, I will ask a follow-up question that will

11         clearly indicate the link that exists.

12             THE COURT: Overruled. Deny the motion to

13        strike.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   You reference not only that Charlie

16   Piendle's age group was deceived, but that the

17   public health officials were deceived as well, what

18   impact did the deception of the public health

19   officials have on the age cohort on people of

20   Charlie Piendle's age?

21              MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor.

22        Calling the public health community deceived at

23        this juncture, it's assuming facts not in

24        evidence --

25             MR. SCAROLA: 111 rephrase the question. 4288

1              MR. KELLY: -- it's argumentative, as most

2        of these questions are.

3             THE COURT: Okay. Rephrase.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   What difference would it have made if the

6   whole truth, as known to the tobacco industry, was

7   not withheld from the public health community, but

8   was disclosed to the public health community? And

9   by what impact would it have had, I mean, what

10   difference would it have made to Charlie Piendle's

11    age cohort if that information had been disclosed?

12             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. It's

13        uncertain, calls for speculation in its present

14        form.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Argumentative.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=94
16             THE COURT: Overruled.

17        A.   My opinion, it would have made a huge

18   difference because the public health community would

19   have changed how the products were available and

20   marketed to consumers, and the information that

21    would have been provided to consumers.

22             If everybody knew that smoking caused lung

23   cancer, if everybody knew that this product was

24   addictive back when this information was first made

25   known to the companies, they knew this information, 4289

1   I mean, you're not going to sell a lethal addictive

2   product the way you do currently and the way it was,

3   with free samples being handed out, with the massive

4   amount of marketing going on, with the placement

5   near candy products in stores when you walk in, the

6   power wall that you see when you go into a store, it

7   would have massively changed the way the public

8   health community would have responded to this

9   problem, the way the government would have responded

10   to this problem, and they didn't have that

11    opportunity because it was framed as a debate, a

12   controversy where the answers were not known.

13             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. It

14        goes far beyond Mr. Piendle's cohort group

15        smoking in the 1950s. It includes references

16        to things that happened when Mr. Piendle was an

17        adult, long after he began smoking in the '50s.

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Also, I would object,

19        your Honor, to a portion of the answer and ask

20        that it be stricken relating to product

21        placement under Reilly in the absence of any

22        time period.

23             MR. SCAROLA: It is directly responsive to

24        the question that was asked, your Honor.

25             THE COURT: Overruled. 4290

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Dr. Cummings, while we may infer what you

3   meant by reference to a power wall in a store, what

4   is a power wall?

5        A.   It's the paid placement of cigarettes when

6   you go into a store --

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection. Reilly,

8        your Honor, no time period.

9             THE COURT: Counsel can clarify.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   Has the meaning of power wall changed from

12   the 1950s to the present time?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Same objection.

14             THE COURT: Overruled.

15        A.   No.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   What is a power wall?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=95
18        A.   Power wall is the display of tobacco,

19   typically behind the cash register that you see in a

20   store that displays the brands, and typically has

21    signage and promotions that are displayed around the

22   brands in a store, and in certain kinds of stores,

23   it's the most common advertising that you see in a

24   store and it's a paid product placement. Those

25   displays are, in fact, paid for through the retailer 4291

1   through agreements with the cigarette manufacturers.

2   All the manufacturers have agreements with major

3   retailers to make sure those displays appear a

4   certain way so they can market their products.

5             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. Move

6        to strike because it made no reference to 1950s

7        and what a power wall, if one existed in the

8         1950s, might have looked like to Mr. Piendle's

9        cohorts.

10             THE COURT: You can follow up with that

11         question. I thought you did say whether it

12        changed from the '50s to the present, but

13        counsel can clarify the time frame.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Dr. Cummings, were the kinds of displays

16   that you have described in use in the 1950s?

17        A.   Yes, they were.

18        Q.   Were they in use in the 1960s?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   Were they in use in the 1970s?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   Were they in use in the 1980s?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Thank you, Dr. Cummings.

25             We have talked about the influence of 4292

1   nondisclosure on Charlie Piendle's age cohort --

2             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'm going to

3        object to these argumentative --

4             THE COURT: Sustained.

5             MR. KELLY: -- introductions to the

6        questions. They continue despite your

7        sustaining.

8             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, there's nothing

9        argumentative about that.

10             MR. KELLY: It's summarizing your

11         objection.

12             THE COURT: I understand the objection.

13        The objection is sustained. If counsel would

14        ask a question without rephrasing what the

15        witness has already testified to.

16             MR. SCAROLA: Sure.

17             MR. KELLY: And, your Honor, if we're

18        going to move on from advertising, may we have

19        the limiting instruction read to the jury?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=96
20             MR. BARNHART: Do we have to listen to a

21         speech --

22             THE COURT: If there's a request for an

23        instruction that has been indicated by the

24        Court at any point in which counsel requests

25        one of the applicable instructions, it can be 4293

1        made.

2             So is counsel requesting the instruction

3        relating to advertising?

4             MR. KELLY: Yes, I am, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Is there any objection from

6        the plaintiff? It's the same instruction that

7        was read yesterday.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think it's necessary

9        to repeat it, your Honor, but if your Honor

10        feels you would like to, I have no objection to

11         it.

12             THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll

13        remind you of the instruction that I read

14        yesterday. You heard evidence regarding

15        defendants' advertising activities. Defendants

16        have the right to advertise their products.

17        Advertising is commercial speech that is

18        protected by the first amendment to the United

19        States Constitution.

20             Accordingly, I instruct you that you may

21         not find liability based on the mere fact the

22        defendants have advertised their products or

23        the amounts spent by defendants in advertising

24        their products. Defendants are entitled to

25        advertise their products under the law; 4294

1        likewise, you may not hold the defendants

2        liable because of who may have found their

3        cigarette advertising or promotion to be

4        appealing.

5             MR. SCAROLA: We would request also, your

6        Honor, the second part of the Noerr-Pennington

7        instruction.

8             THE COURT: The Court has also previously

9        instructed you and this was at the inception of

10        the case about --

11              MR. KELLY: We would object to this with

12        respect to advertising. It is nonapplicable to

13        advertising.

14             THE COURT: The instruction has been

15        previously given to the jury and I will present

16        it again.

17             However, false, misleading, or deceitful

18        statements and misrepresentations are not

19        protected under the first amendment.

20             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you, your Honor.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=97
22        Q.   I want to focus on the age cohort of

23   Charlie Piendle now in the '60s, those seven out of

24   ten young men who have already begun to smoke. Do

25   you have an opinion, based upon your knowledge, 4295

1    experience, training, and research as to whether the

2   withholding of information by the tobacco industry

3   from that age cohort had any influence on that age

4   cohort continuing to smoke through the decade of the

5    1960s?

6        A.   Yes, I do.

7        Q.   What is that opinion?

8        A.   It did have an effect. In fact, it was

9   that age cohort and probably the one and two after

10   that cohort that were really exposed to the public

11    relations disinformation campaign, as I call it, by

12   the cigarette companies to deny the health risks of

13   smoking, to withhold information about the addictive

14   properties and, in fact, inform consumers that

15   cigarettes were not addictive, and that was done, in

16   large part, to keep people smoking, to give them a

17   psychological crutch, and a self-rationale to keep

18   smoking.

19        Q.   Did the continuing withholding of

20   information by the tobacco industry, through the

21    1970s, have any impact on those persons of Charlie

22   Piendle's age continuing to smoke during the 1970s?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

25   please, what that impact was. 4296

1        A.   Well, the impact was to, again, try to

2   sway public opinion, to create doubt about the

3   health controversy without ever denying the risk,

4   but to create the doubt in the public's mind and for

5   an addictive smoker, that's exactly what you need to

6   do to give them the self-rationale and psychological

7   crutch.

8             And to further reassure them that they

9   were working on the health risks of smoking, they

10   would introduce products without claiming that they

11    have anything to do with the health risk and

12   smoking, but they introduced filtered cigarettes

13   first and then low tar, and that was a major element

14   to reassure smokers.

15             And Mr. Piendle was exactly a poster child

16   for this. He started out experimenting with

17   unfiltered cigarettes, because that was the popular

18   cigarettes of the day, went to filtered cigarettes,

19   and then to low tar. This is exactly what the plan

20   was, and continued to smoke. The only thing

21    different was he stopped smoking in 1989.

22        Q.   Did the same effect carry through within

23   Charlie Piendle's age cohort through the 1980s?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=98
24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   Seven out of ten young men in Charlie's 4297

1    age group began smoking in the late '50s. How many

2   of them managed to quit in the '60s?

3        A.   Well, actually, cigarette consumption

4   peaked in the 1960s, around 1967. That was the top

5   year for cigarette consumption. So despite the fact

6   there was a little drop in the early 1950s around

7   the health scare from smoking, cigarette sales

8   rebounded with the introduction of the public

9   reassurance campaign being introduced and then

10   filtered cigarettes.

11              But in the 1960s, after the Surgeon

12   General's report, many men, in particular, did try

13   to quit smoking and then they discovered it's hard

14   to quit. So you actually saw a little drop in

15   cigarette consumption the first two months after the

16   Surgeon General's report was issued in January of

17    1964, and then it rebounded to its peak levels.

18             So what you find, nicotine addiction is a

19   chronic relapsing disorder, so people begin to start

20   making quit attempts, failing, and not really

21    understanding why. They didn't understand the

22   effect that their brain literally had been

23   highjacked by the effect of nicotine because that

24   happens early on, particularly if you're a young

25   smoker, the effects of nicotine on the brain or to 4298

1    alter the brain structure a little bit more

2   severely, which is why we find people who start

3   early in life have a harder time quitting at the

4   other end.

5        Q.   How did that age group do in the 1970s?

6        A.   Well, again, there was more people making

7   quit attempts, and we did see reductions overall in

8   the age cohort, particularly among men, beginning to

9   quit. So there was an increasing number of people

10   quitting.

11              The people who were able to quit more

12   successfully were those who were less addicted to

13   begin with, and there is individual variation in

14   addiction. So lighter smokers, people who were

15   nondaily smokers were more likely to quit and stay

16   off. There was a lot of quitting activity, but most

17   of it was quit and relapse back to smoking.

18             The average annual quit rate that you see

19   among a cohort of smokers was about 3 to 4 percent a

20   year. A hundred smokers, 3 to 4 percent will be off

21    of cigarettes after a year. That's a very low

22   percentage. There's a lot of quitting activity

23   going on, most of that result in failure. Nine out

24   of ten people that try to quit fail. They end up

25   back smoking again. It's an addiction. It's a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=99
4299

1    chronic, relapsing problem, and once addicted,

2   you're always addicted.

3        Q.   So in terms of Charlie Piendle's age

4   group, of the seven youngsters that started to smoke

5   in the late '50s, how many were still smoking at the

6   end of the'60s?

7        A.   I don't know the actual number. It was --

8   it would be down, probably; maybe five or six out of

9   ten, you'd lose a couple. I don't know the actual

10   percentage. There was some decline. Particularly

11    after '64, they tended to be the lighter smokers.

12   And information, more and more information was

13   coming out to create that balance of that tension in

14   your brain about the health risks of smoking, and

15   that grew over time and probably, you know, peaked

16   sometime in the 1990s.

17        Q.   Let me make sure that there's no confusion

18   about your testimony. Are you telling us that out

19   of every seven smokers who began smoking in the late

20   '50s, five or six would have been able to overcome

21    their addiction to the standpoint -- to the

22   standpoint that they were no longer smoking at all

23   by the end of the 1960s?

24        A.   No, I'm saying by the end of the 1960s, of

25   the seven out of ten that were smoking, you would 4300

1   probably get it down to five or six out of ten who

2   would still be smoking.

3        Q.   What about by the end of the 1970s?

4        A.   It would be further reduced, perhaps,

5   about four out of ten would still be smoking and,

6   you know, over time, you do see fewer and fewer

7   smokers. You have to look at the percentages, the

8   prevalence of smoking certainly was going down, and

9   that started to really go down from the high mark of

10   the mid-1960s.

11         Q.   Have you looked specifically at how

12   Charlie did compared to his age cohort in having

13   stopped as of 1989?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And tell the ladies and gentlemen of the

16   jury, please, what -- what Charlie's performance was

17   in terms of his ability to quit by that point in

18   time, as compared to his whole age group?

19        A.   I would say it's about average of what

20   we've seen in the population, you know, in terms of

21    many quit attempts, leading up to the time that he

22   finally quit in 1989 and, you know, certainly he was

23   relatively young, but you see more quitting and

24   sustaining quitting particularly around age 50, you

25   begin to notice the effects of smoking. 4301

1            Usually there's a little bit of experience

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=100
2   and people learn when they make quit attempts, and

3   that's a learning process for quitting. And we try

4   to tell people not to get discouraged. So I would

5   say he was about average relative to the cohorts

6   that we followed. Some people continued to go on

7   and smoke. But most smokers in our survey, 90

8   percent, actually over 90 percent say they regret

9   ever starting to smoke, they wish they didn't smoke.

10             In our cohort studies, when we asked

11   people whether they tried to quit smoking over their

12   lifetime, 96 percent of smokers tried to quit.

13             So there's a lot of motivation to quit.

14   The problem is sustaining, staying off the

15   cigarettes, and that's because of nicotine

16   dependence, and it takes a process and usually years

17   before people are successful in finally getting off

18   of cigarettes. Some people never make it off. If

19   you're a lighter smoker or nondaily smokers, it's

20   usually not so hard to quit. In fact, I would say

21    nondaily smokers, I would say, are not addicted, but

22   daily smokers are.

23        Q.   Based upon your education, training,

24   experience, and research, do you have an opinion, to

25   a reasonable degree of certainty, within your area 4302

1    of expertise, as to whether Charlie Piendle was

2   addicted to nicotine and cigarettes?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   What is that opinion?

5        A.   My opinion is based on my review of his

6   smoking history and the things that I read in his

7   medical records and from the testimony from family

8   members and friends, there's no doubt in my mind

9   that he was an addicted smoker.

10             He smoked heavily, he made quit attempts

11    that failed, he smoked first thing in the morning,

12   which is our strongest indicator of somebody who is

13   an addicted smoker, which reflects the physiologic

14   effects of nicotine when you're depleted. You know,

15   people that smoke when they first get up in the

16   morning tend to be the ones who struggle the most to

17   quit. And he was certainly a daily smoker from a

18   very young age.

19             Again, younger age of exposure to nicotine

20   tends to lead to heavier smoking, and he was a

21    classic example of someone I would consider a heavy

22   addicted smoker.

23        Q.   Does smoking first thing in the morning

24   mean smoking before your feet hit the ground?

25             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is cumulative 4303

1        to Dr. Burns and Dr. Benowitz.

2             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor, I

3        don't ever remember anyone asking that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=101
4        question.

5             THE COURT: Overruled.

6        A.   Yes, I've heard that for many smokers and

7   it's actually one of the things we ask in screening

8   smokers, when we see them in our clinics, as well as

9   over the quit line, smoke first thing in the

10   morning, and people often tell me, I have a

11    cigarette right there on the bed table, first thing

12   I do is put it in my mouth before my feet hit the

13   ground in the morning.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Does waiting to have your first cigarette

16   until you walk from the bedroom to the kitchen to

17   have it with your cup of coffee mean that you're not

18   smoking first thing in the morning?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Based upon your education, training,

21    experience, and understanding that the defendants

22   have admitted that Charlie Piendle died of lung

23   cancer directly caused by smoking, was Charlie

24   Piendle's addiction to nicotine and cigarettes the

25   cause of his death? 4304

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, argumentative.

2             THE COURT: Overruled.

3        A.   In my opinion, it was the cause of his

4   death. Nicotine addiction is what leads to the

5   repeated exposures to the 4,000 chemicals, 60 or so

6   carcinogens, or suspect carcinogens that are in

7   every puff of a cigarette, and long-term exposure is

8   what leads to the lung cancer and the type of lung

9   cancer he had, and the amount of smoking and the

10   pack-year history that I found in his records, and

11    through the testimony is clearly -- leads me to the

12   opinion that his addiction to nicotine is what

13   caused his lung cancer.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   How do you respond to the suggestion,

16   Dr. Cummings, that 13, 14, or 15-year-old Charlie

17   Piendle made an informed choice to smoke because he

18   and his friends called cigarettes "cancer stick" and

19    "coffee nails" -- excuse me, "coffin nails," I'm

20   thinking coffee. I think I may need a coffee nail

21    right now.

22        A.   Well, how do I -- he did not make an

23   informed choice. Nobody was making informed choices

24   at the time that, you know, he started smoking in

25   the early 1950s. And teenagers typically are 4305

1    smoking for psychosocial reasons, and even today,

2   I'm not sure that's the main thing that would be

3   critical to their decision to try smoking, because

4   most teenagers who start smoking in the studies that

5   I've done of teenagers don't ever believe -- they

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=102
6   think they can quit and put it away at any time

7   until they find one day, when they try to quit, this

8   is a lot harder than I thought. And then you're in

9   that cycle of addiction, and it's harder to get out,

10   and that's really what happened to Charlie.

11         Q.   How do you respond to someone who says

12   that through the subsequent decades in the '60s, the

13   70s and '80s, when Charlie was a pack and a half to

14   two packs a day smoker, he obviously had enough

15   knowledge to give him the power to quit smoking

16   because everyone knew that smoking was hazardous to

17   a person's health?

18        A.   Well, that's an outrageous claim. Most

19   people have no knowledge of how the cigarette has

20   been engineered to keep and maintain their nicotine

21    dependence.

22             Certainly, in the 1950s, '60s and '70s,

23   the level of knowledge about the risks of smoking

24   among consumers, in the early 1950s, 1953, less than

25    1 percent of smokers linked cigarette smoking to 4306

1   lung cancer. You had doctors who were smoking.

2   There was really a lack of understanding. There was

3   a general awareness that, oh, yeah, smoking may be

4   linked to something, but it wasn't a belief that

5   people shared. Most of the concern about smoking

6   was around irritation and mildness, and then the

7   reassurance of filtration, low tar helped keep

8   people smoking.

9             So -- and people are not informed today.

10   Most people are not aware of the use of

11    reconstituted tobacco, the use of some of the

12   additives to reduce the harshness of the poison that

13   you inhale. These are all little design tricks that

14   are put into the cigarettes to keep people smoking.

15             We've studied and asked people about

16   filters, whether a filter makes cigarette safer, it

17   doesn't, but people believe it does.

18        Q.   What is your reaction to the idea that

19   Charlie Piendle liked to ride motorcycles, so he was

20   obviously a risk-taker who freely chose to take the

21    health risks associated with smoking. Does that

22   make sense?

23        A.   Well, if the risk -- no, it doesn't make

24   any sense. I mean, the risks of smoking, the

25   choice, I guess, for Charlie was in the early 1950s, 4307

1   the risks were not known to consumers, as I just

2   stated, and they were certainly concealed from

3   consumers by the companies. And then he's addicted.

4             And so that's -- you know, you're not

5   addicted to riding a motorcycle. I guess you have a

6   choice to get on and off a motorcycle, but you don't

7   have a choice when your brain has been altered as a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=103
8   kid.

9             And then one day you wake up and you find

10   that you need this drug, and this drug just happens

11    to come along with so many lousy chemicals, 4,000

12   chemicals, 60 known or suspect carcinogens in every

13   puff. And then you begin to self-rationalize the

14   idea that, well, maybe it won't happen to me, I'll

15   quit before it's too late. And a lot of people,

16   unfortunately, don't get around to quitting soon

17   enough.

18        Q.   Would it be accurate to suggest that since

19   Charlie Piendle did successfully quit in 1989 and

20   quit cold turkey, some might say the first time he

21    made a really serious try to quit, that since he was

22   able to quit cold turkey in 1989, he never really

23   was addicted?

24             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, asking the witness

25        to comment upon the accuracy of these 4308

1         argumentative questions is really calling for a

2        speech from a witness, and that's improper.

3             THE COURT: I'll have you rephrase the

4        question.

5     BY MR. SCAROLA:

6        Q.   Does the fact that Charlie Piendle quit

7   cold turkey in 1989 mean that Charlie Piendle was

8   never addicted to nicotine and cigarettes?

9        A.   No, not at all.

10        Q.   Explain that, please.

11         A.   Well, I mean, the addiction is -- most

12   people who quit drugs quit cold turkey. They don't

13   quit with, you know, some other method necessarily.

14   So cold turkey is the most common way that people

15   get off of addictive drugs, whether it be heroin or

16   cocaine or nicotine.

17             So the fact that he quit cold turkey has

18   nothing to do with whether he was addicted or not.

19   He was addicted. So that would be my answer to that

20   question.

21         Q.   How do you respond to the suggestion that

22   since Charlie is consistently described by those who

23   knew him as a strong-willed person, and even a very

24   strong-willed person, that all he really needed to

25   do to quit was to set his mind to it? 4309

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection.

2             MR. KELLY: Object to the form. He's

3        calling for speeches.

4             THE COURT: Sustained.

5             Rephrase.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   What is the influence of an individual

8   being a strong-willed person on that individual's

9   ability to be able to overcome an addiction to

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=104
10   nicotine such as the level of addiction that Charlie

11    Piendle had in 1989 or '88 or '87 or '86?

12        A.   One's will -- being strong-willed is not

13   going to -- the fact that you can't quit and you're

14   strong-willed is probably an indication of the

15   strength of the addiction.

16             And he made prior quit attempts. His

17   ability to quit was not -- you know, his choice to

18   try to quit, that was there, that's a choice, but

19   his ability to quit is a constrained choice, and it

20   was constrained by the fact that his behavior is

21    controlled by the nicotine.

22             I mean, his volition -- that's what

23   addiction is, is the -- your volitional control to

24   voluntarily be able to quit and just put the

25   cigarettes down easily was out of his control, it 4310

1   was reinforced by a drug, the drug being nicotine,

2   the delivery system being a cigarette, and the

3   alteration in the brain had occurred when he was a

4   teenager, and that alteration doesn't go away, there

5   are permanent changes in your brain, receptor sites

6   that receive the nicotine and release the dopamine

7   in the brain.

8             And despite even after he quit, he was

9   still addicted, and he was at risk of going back.

10   So once addicted, always addicted. The fact that he

11    quit is an indication that -- and he made quit

12   attempts as an indication that he had strong

13   motivation to quit. And prior to it, he had strong

14   motivation. Any attempt at quitting is your best

15   indicator of a strong motivation to quit.

16        Q.   Isn't it true, Dr. Cummings, that Charlie

17   Piendle's use of cigarettes wasn't really an

18   addiction, it was just a habit that he chose not to

19   break for over 30 years?

20        A.   No. I mean, the use of the word "habit"

21    is a euphemism, I think, that has been used

22   frequently in various reports that are out there,

23   but it's an addiction. "Dependence" is another

24   word.

25             And you have to look at the pattern of 4311

1    one's smoking, daily use, how much you're smoking,

2   time to first cigarette, experience trying to quit,

3   you know, what -- such as getting moody and so on,

4   some of the withdrawal that people experience when

5   they try to quit.

6             So those are sort of the hallmarks that

7   one looks at in terms of measuring nicotine

8   dependence, addiction or a habit, I don't care what

9   you call it, it's an addiction.

10             And people who are nondaily smokers and

11    that's their only pattern, and there are about 10 to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=105
12    15 percent of those in the population, they're

13   probably not addicted, but most people are addicted

14   to cigarettes. And then when you look at the level

15   of addiction, it varies between individuals.

16        Q.   In your experience with over a million

17   smokers, is Charlie Piendle the only strong-willed

18   person that you've come across who's become addicted

19   to cigarettes?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   Is it uncommon for strong-willed people to

22   have become addicted to cigarettes?

23        A.   It's not uncommon for -- and certainly in

24   the age cohort that we are talking about, it's not

25   uncommon for most people to become addicted to 4312

1    cigarettes. And whether you're strong-willed or

2   weak-willed or however you want to define that, I

3   find to suggest that all you need is willpower to be

4   able to quit is wrong. Not everyone can quit

5   smoking easily. Most people can't.

6             Nine out of ten people who come to our

7   clinics for help, these are people seeking help to

8   quit at a cancer center are failing. And the

9   treatment that we use and the treatment that I talk

10   about with doctors is to talk about treating a

11    chronic relapsing problem, because that's what this

12   is all about, this is a nicotine addiction.

13             And the frequent quit attempts over many

14   years leading up to finally quitting is a pattern

15   that's very consistent with somebody who is

16   struggling to quit smoking, which is, again, a

17   reflection of nicotine dependence, or addiction, or

18   a strong habit if you want to call it that, I don't

19   really care whether you call it a habit or addiction

20   or whatever, we're talking about a drug-reinforced

21   behavior.

22        Q.   In your experience, is Charlie Piendle the

23   only Marine Corps veteran or Marine to ever become

24   addicted to cigarettes?

25        A.   No. 4313

1         Q.   In your experience, is it unusual for

2   Marines to become addicted to cigarettes because

3   they're really tough guys and they don't get

4   addicted to anything?

5        A.   No, it doesn't matter how tough you are.

6   Again, most people get started smoking in that

7   window between age 12 and 24, that's the golden

8   window of when people take up smoking.

9        Q.   Was it only gullable people in Charlie's

10   age cohort or unintelligent people in Charlie

11    Piendle's age cohort who got addicted to nicotine in

12   cigarettes?

13        A.   It's nothing to do with intelligence.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=106
14        Q.   Let's take a little bit closer look at the

15   addictive process and how it specifically applied to

16   Charlie Piendle in order to get a better

17   understanding of those opinions, if we could,

18   Dr. Cummings.

19             MR. SCAROLA: Could I have graphic

20        991400-20.

21              MR. KELLY: Your Honor -

22             Can I have an exhibit number, Counsel?

23             MR. SCAROLA: It's the addictive process

24        demonstrative from Dr. Benowitz you've already

25        seen. 4314

1              MR. KELLY: Your Honor, may I have a

2        continuing objection to the extent that we're

3        going to go through cumulative testimony?

4             MR. SCAROLA: I don't intend to be

5        cumulative, your Honor. I think that perhaps

6        it was seen in opening statement, but I am told

7        it wasn't used with Dr. Benowitz.

8             THE COURT: Overruled.

9             MR. KELLY: My screen isn't on,

10        your Honor.

11              THE COURT: You may proceed.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   Will that graphic help us to better

14   understand the addictive process, Dr. Cummings?

15        A.   Sure.

16        Q.   First of all, can you tell us whether

17   addiction is the same for each individual?

18        A.   No.

19        Q.   Are there, however, similarities and

20   commonalities in addiction that have been identified

21    and are commonly accepted to exist?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   Is addiction of a nature that it's like

24   turning on and off a switch? One day you're not

25   addicted, and then you smoke just one more 4315

1    cigarette, and now you're addicted?

2        A.   No.

3        Q.   Tell us how that works, please, and to the

4   extent the graphic is of assistance to you, please

5   make reference to that.

6        A.   Sure. With nicotine addiction, what

7   typically happens is somebody starts out smoking and

8   experimenting, they're not addicted, they've never

9   tried cigarettes, usually aversive the first time

10   you puff on a cigarette, a little light-headed and

11    dizzy from some of the fumes you get. Carbon

12   monoxide and nicotine actually gives you a little

13   light-headed feeling.

14             You overcome that typically for

15   psychosocial reasons. That's a fancy way of saying

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=107
16   your friends are doing it, you want to look cool.

17   There are a variety of social reasons that tend to

18   encourage people to continue to go on and smoke.

19             And then after a period of time, usually

20   up to about a hundred cigarettes on average, this is

21    the way we measure it in young people, if you get to

22   a hundred cigarettes, that's five packs, that's

23   usually the tipping point, on average. Now, there's

24   individual variation, some people don't need as

25   many, some people use more, but a hundred 4316

1    cigarettes, now you've altered your brain, and the

2   brain becomes dependent because you develop new

3   receptors in the brain to get the effect of the

4   nicotine, and your brain begins to need the nicotine

5   to get the dopamine release, the pleasure feeling

6   that you get. Because the absence of dopamine now

7   makes you irritable, moody, that antsy feeling in

8   the pit of your stomach.

9             And that's when the free choice begins to

10   end, when you sort of cross over that barrier from

11    experimentation in this early phase, which for most

12   young people, since most, you know, people who take

13   up smoking in this country, if you ask the adults

14   when did you start smoking, it's usually during

15   those teen years. When they get to that hundred

16   cigarette threshold, then you're into more the

17   addicted cycle.

18             Now, I put in this addictive cycle daily

19   use, because there are a segment of the population

20   who respond differently to nicotine. Some people

21    are much slower metabolizers of nicotine. They

22   excrete it much more slowly. They tend to get away

23   with smoking more for social reasons. There are

24   about 10 to 15 percent of the population that smoke

25   on a nondaily basis continually. I mean, that's the 4317

1    group, they're the weekend social smokers that

2   exist. They probably find that they can quit

3   smoking relatively easily. I would say they're not

4   addicted.

5             The daily users are addicted. And then I

6   look at the daily-use individuals for how much they

7   smoke, smoking first thing in the morning, patterns

8   around their quitting efforts, so they have tried to

9   quit before, asking them about their experience in

10   their past quitting attempts, which gives us a

11    measure of the level of addiction. But the addicted

12   individuals have lost their choice, I call it a

13   constrained choice, because now their ability to

14   stay off cigarettes is largely dictated by their

15   drug - seeking behavior for nicotine.

16             The average pack of cigarettes have 20

17   cigarettes in a pack. For most people, that's a

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=108
18   daily supply of nicotine. Some people need more,

19   some people can get away with a little less.

20   There's individual variability.

21              Again, I would relate it to how people

22   metabolize the nicotine, which means how quickly it

23   comes into their system, hits their brain in seven

24   to ten seconds, that's rapid delivery, but how long

25   it sits in their brain and they excrete it out of 4318

1   their system varies between individuals. Not unlike

2   any other drug. We measure chemotherapy in cancer

3   patients. They differ in how they respond. And

4   they differ in how they respond to nicotine in the

5   same way.

6             And we're now identifying nicotine, you

7   know, metabolizing genes and, you know, features of

8   nicotine metabolizer, to look at fast and slow

9   metabolizers. Somebody like Mr. Piendle, he smoked

10   one to two packs of cigarettes a day. He was on the

11    high end. He's probably a fast metabolizer of

12   cigarettes and needed the nicotine, and so he had a

13   strong addiction. That's what I had testified to a

14   few moments ago. Not only was it my opinion he was

15   addicted, he was heavily addicted, and he's in this

16   cycle. So to get out, it's hard to get out because

17   you quit and you find you need the nicotine.

18             Most people who are addicted can only quit

19   for a short period of time. Usually the first day

20   or two, that's when most of the relapses occur.

21    People are back smoking again. They get reinforced

22   when they go back to smoke because you feel

23   miserable, you take a drag on a cigarette, and all

24   of a sudden you feel better. Well, maybe I'll get

25   around to quitting, this wasn't the right time, too 4319

1   much stress in my life, or whatever. People come up

2   with excuses, but not really understanding how

3   nicotine is actually controlling their behavior.

4        Q.   What did the industry know about the age

5   group of persons who entered this process at the

6   experimentation stage?

7             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, as with many of

8        these questions, that calls for speculation. I

9        believe there's an opinion the witness has, and

10        I thought your Honor indicated the questions

11         were to be framed as an opinion so the jury

12        wasn't confused as to what was fact --

13             THE COURT: Counsel can rephrase.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   I'll rephrase.

16             What do the documents that you have

17   reviewed indicate that the industry knew about the

18   age of persons who entered this addictive process at

19   the experimentation stage?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=109
20             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that calls for

21         interpretation. That's not a correct way to

22        ask for an opinion.

23             MR. SCAROLA: I'll rephrase the question

24        again. I'll rephrase it again. 25

4320

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Do you have an opinion, having read the

3   documents, as to what the industry knew about how

4   old people were when they began experimenting with

5   tobacco?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   What is that opinion?

8        A.   The industry knew that the experimentation

9   phase occurred during the preteen and teen years

10   predominantly, that two-thirds of all adult smokers

11   began their smoking careers before the age of 18.

12   And this had a major impact on their decision-making

13   around marketing and getting first usual brand

14   choice, they knew that first usual brand was a

15   critical factor to brand loyalty, which related to

16   the profits of their company.

17             MR. KELLY: Move to strike as

18        nonresponsive on the argumentative portions

19        after what he believed the documents showed

20        concerning when people start smoking.

21              THE COURT: I'll sustain the motion as to

22        the last portion of the witness' testimony as

23        nonresponsive to the question as presented, and

24        ask to the jury to disregard the testimony

25        relating to profit. 4321

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Do the documents that we are about to see

3   expressly identify the age at which, that is, the

4   internal documents of the tobacco industry expressly

5   identify the age at which persons began to enter

6   that addictive process?

7        A.   Yes, they do.

8        Q.   Do those documents talk about the

9   relationship between entering into that addictive

10   process and corporate profits?

11         A.   They do.

12        Q.   Has the age at which most smokers

13   generally enter this addictive process and begin

14   their experimentation with tobacco changed over the

15   course of time between the 1950s and today?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   You have mentioned a number of times

18   throughout your testimony the word "choice." From

19   the perspective of your training and experience, I'd

20   like you to discuss that concept of choice in more

21    detail, and the role that choice plays in an

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=110
22   individual smoker's history.

23             First, how does knowledge influence

24   choice? And if it's different at different stages

25   of the addictive process, I'd like you to describe 4322

1   that to us, please.

2        A.   Sure. Well, knowledge does influence

3   choice. You need information, you need knowledge to

4   make decisions. So certainly exposure to

5   information certainly influences experimentation,

6   and it also influences the decision to try to quit.

7             We know that over time, as information

8   became more common in the environment about the

9   dangers of smoking, more and more people made

10   efforts to quit. So that has a direct relationship.

11              The problem is that doesn't relate to the

12   ability to stay off cigarettes, which addicted

13   smokers struggle to do, and because -- so that's why

14   I use the word "constrained" choice. People inside

15   the addiction cycle, their ability to control their

16   behavior is constrained by their biological

17   addiction to nicotine, as well as the design of the

18   products that are explicitly marketed with the

19   intent of keeping the person smoking by maintaining

20   a minimum amount of nicotine. Below that threshold

21    a person would be able to have a choice, but there

22   aren't any of those cigarettes on the market.

23        Q.   So not only does knowledge impact choice,

24   but addiction also impacts choice?

25        A.   Addiction impacts choice because it 4323

1    constrains one's free choice. They don't have --

2   addicted smokers don't have a free choice.

3        Q.   What then do addiction scientists mean

4   when they talk about "last completely free choice"?

5        A.   Well, it's that point when your brain has

6   been altered and you're now into the addiction

7   cycle. You're that person who is now dependent on

8   nicotine and the drug-reinforced actions of nicotine

9   in your brain that keep you -- make it hard for you

10   to stop smoking, not impossible, but makes it hard

11    to quit. So you don't have a free choice like

12   riding a motorcycle.

13        Q.   Does the phrase "illusion of choice" have

14   any significance in the context of this discussion?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   What does that phrase mean?

17        A.   Well, I mean, it means that people are

18   deceived into thinking that it all just depends on

19   their free choice, their will to quit, and that's an

20   illusion when you're an addicted smoker.

21         Q.   What effect does each new cigarette have

22   once we get past this experimentation stage, after

23   we pass that hundred cigarette threshold?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=111
24        A.   What -- I'm not sure I understand the

25   question. 4324

1         Q.   What is the significance of every new

2   cigarette the smoker lights up and inhales into his

3   lungs from this point forward?

4        A.   Sure. Well, once somebody is an addicted

5   smoker, every cigarette that they smoke, every puff

6   on a cigarette actually influences, supplies their

7   brain of the needed nicotine. In fact, the first

8   couple of drags on a cigarette usually are most

9   important, which is why we look at that first

10   cigarette of the day as a criteria for addiction,

11   because you're replenishing the nicotine that you

12   need in your system.

13             Most people who are really addicted smoke

14   every 20 to 30 minutes throughout the waking hours

15   of the day because the effect of nicotine wears off,

16   they have got to replenish it. So they go through

17   these up and down troughs throughout the course of

18   the day.

19             Every cigarette you smoke, in addition to

20   supplying the nicotine, does your body damage,

21   because the other harmful chemicals in cigarette

22   smoke affect the cells and the DNA and damages that,

23   and your body has a repair mechanism and repairs

24   those cells so people can go on for while, some

25   people for a long while because they have 4325

1    genetically a good repair mechanism.

2             But for people who get sick and get

3   cancer, essentially that DNA mechanism of repair

4   from the constant assault of the carcinogens in

5   tobacco break down, and they develop cancer. And

6   once you have that cancer cell growing and it

7   multiplies, that's what you see.

8             So every cigarette -- what I say, every

9   cigarette you smoke does your body damage, supplies

10   you with nicotine to keep you smoking, and it

11    damages the cells every time. For the smoker it

12   could be the next puff on a cigarette where they

13   have now gone over that threshold of DNA damage

14   where their body can't respond any longer. And that

15   probably explains the individual variability you get

16   in some people who get sick younger and some people

17   that don't get sick and other people who can smoke a

18   lot of years and don't get sick until they're much

19   older in life.

20        Q.   You used the phrase "constrained choice,"

21    and I want to be sure that we all understand exactly

22   what you mean by that. So describe, please, that

23   phrase, and relate it to what we see on the graphic

24   in front of us, "last completely free choice."

25        A.   Sure. Constrained choice just means that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=112
4326

1   the ability to stop smoking easily, you have a free

2   choice to do it, has been now constrained by the --

3   your biology, your nicotine dependence, which is

4   influenced both, as I said, by a person's individual

5   biology because there's individual variation.

6        Q.   Would a synonym for constrained in that

7   context be restricted?

8        A.   Yeah. Restricted choice, limited choice,

9   not free choice. I mean, you know, it's a

10   drug-reinforced behavior, and that's -- it's not a

11    free choice any longer once you get addicted.

12             And I said there are about 10 to

13    15 percent of smokers I wouldn't put into that

14   category. We call them chippers. They get away

15   with smoking on weekends or on a nondaily basis,

16   they don't have a regular part -- a pattern of

17   smoking that seems to be dictated by their brain's

18   need for nicotine. Most smokers don't fall into

19   that category.

20        Q.   Has research addressed the issue of the

21    impact of physical pain on an addicted smoker's

22   timing and ability to quit smoking?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Would you tell us, please, about that.

25        A.   Well, cigarettes help relax you. They 4327

1    also give pleasure in the brain. Dopamine is a

2   pleasure chemical in your brain. So you take a drag

3   on a cigarette, it actually gives you pleasure. So

4   if you're experiencing pain, it tends to help

5   alleviate that pain, so it actually would reinforce

6   the smoking behavior, probably make it harder to

7   quit, that's been my experience with people.

8        Q.   What about -- what about emotional stress,

9   emotional strain and adversity in one's life, how

10   does that impact upon an addicted smoker's ability

11    to successfully decrease his use of nicotine?

12        A.   The same reason I just gave, is that

13   nicotine actually is a stress reliever. A lot of

14   people use cigarettes as a coping device. If you're

15   under emotional strain or depressed or whatever, we

16   do find a higher rate of smoking for people under

17   those circumstances. And that's actually

18   well-established in scientific literature.

19        Q.   Of the entire smoke population, how many

20   smokers are within the addiction cycle and how many

21    remain outside?

22        A.   I would say 80 to 85 percent are inside

23   the cycle. About -- or excuse me, 85 to 90 are

24   inside the cycle and about 10 to 15 percent are

25   these chippers that I described. 4328

1        Q.   And how do we distinguish between those

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=113
2   inside the cycle of addiction and those who still

3   remain outside with some degree of completely free

4   choice?

5        A.   Well, the way we ask is daily use, and so

6   on our surveys, we ask a couple of odd questions,

7   but one question is, have you smoked a hundred

8   cigarettes in your lifetime, and if you do, then we

9   go on and ask do you currently smoke every day, some

10   days, or not at all.

11         Q.   So the hundred cigarettes is the threshold

12   question that triggers the need for further inquiry?

13        A.   Yes. It's not my question, it's a

14   question that the U.S. federal government uses for

15   their screening, and we have found in our studies

16   and validated through our studies that it's a useful

17   indicator of who is a smoker. So if you're less

18   than a hundred cigarettes, because a lot of people

19   have tried smoking as a teenager, but they don't get

20   to that hundred cigarette threshold, chances are

21    they're considered a never smoker. So that's the

22   way they're classified.

23             If you get to a hundred cigarettes, then

24   you're an ever smoker, and then we look at the daily

25   use, you smoke every day, some days, or not at all. 4329

1   Then when we get the daily users, then we go on and

2   ask more detailed questions about their level of

3   nicotine dependence.

4        Q.   Just for comparisons, Dr. Cummings, if we

5   were to take the entire universe of regular users of

6   alcohol, how many fall outside the area of alcohol

7   addiction as compared to those who fall within the

8   alcohol addiction cycle?

9        A.   Well, it's much lower than it is for

10   cigarettes. You have about 15 to 20 percent of

11   people, if you do population surveys, it would be

12   classified as high risk drinkers, so that's what we

13   have found in our studies, and we've done studies on

14   alcohol use as well. It's a much lower percentage

15   versus the 90 to 85 percent of people who smoke are

16   in that addiction cycle. So cigarettes turn out to

17   be a lot more -- has a higher abuse potential, as

18   they call it in the drug lingo, they're more

19   addictive.

20        Q.   Are there different approaches to

21    assessing nicotine addiction? You mentioned the

22   approach where you begin with the hundred cigarette

23   question and go on to further inquiries, are there

24   other approaches that are commonly used?

25        A.   Well, what I described before was how you 4330

1    sort of get to who is a daily user and nondaily

2   users, and then a variety of approaches that are

3   used to measure the level of physical dependence to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=114
4   nicotine, and so there's a variety of scales that

5   have been used. We've done studies to validate

6   which of these scales are best, more predictive of

7   who struggles to quit and who doesn't. Because we

8   use them for treatment to tailor the treatment to

9   those who need a little bit more support in order to

10   be successful in staying off cigarettes. So there

11    are a variety of scales, is the answer to your

12   question.

13        Q.   Are there factors recognized as

14   reinforcing the addiction process from the outside?

15        A.   Sure.

16        Q.   And what are they?

17        A.   Well, there's the push and pull, and the

18   factors that keep you pulled in, the primary ones

19   are the design of the product, as I described, and

20   that's a part of the marketing mix. So products are

21    engineered to keep you smoking. And then there are

22   also the number of friends who are smokers, the

23   advertising that's out there. And the factors that

24   would get you out of that addiction cycle are the

25   information environment, the price of the product, 4331

1   where you can smoke, and these kinds of factors are,

2   in fact, making a difference in terms of getting

3   more people to make quit attempts.

4        Q.   What does the scientific community

5   recognize as the factors that stand as the most

6   serious obstacles to overcoming nicotine addiction?

7        A.   The most serious obstacle to nicotine

8   addiction?

9        Q.   Overcoming nicotine addiction.

10        A.   It's the design of the product. It's the

11    delivery of nicotine in that product, the rapid

12   delivery. A drug is more addictive if it affects

13   the brain rapidly. So a drug that comes in the form

14   of a Band-Aid, nicotine patch, for example, it's a

15   very slow delivery, it takes about two hours to get

16   the nicotine levels up, and then you wear it 24

17   hours, so it's a steady delivery. Versus a

18   cigarette, you take a drag on a cigarette, the

19   nicotine is carried in the tar particles into your

20   lungs, a huge surface area, and it gets into your

21   bloodstream and hits your brain in about seven to

22   ten seconds, so it's a rapid, reinforcing effect.

23             And drugs that are faster deliverers

24   are -- delivery systems that deliver the drug

25   rapidly are much more addictive. Cocaine snorted is 4332

1   pretty addictive, but you smoke it as crack cocaine,

2   very addictive. Because the delivery is an aerosol

3   and it gets into that large surface area of your

4   lungs and it gets to your brain rapidly where it has

5   its reinforcing effect. The cigarette, it's the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=115
6   optimum delivery for the drug nicotine, in terms of

7   its addiction potential. You don't have to deliver

8   nicotine so rapidly, which is why the cigarette, I

9   would say, is the biggest barrier to people quitting

10   smoking.

11         Q.   Do the industry documents that you have

12   reviewed enable you to form an opinion as to whether

13   the industry had a conscious awareness that

14   cigarette design, as a nicotine delivery system, was

15   the most serious obstacle to people quitting

16   smoking?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   Do those documents reflect a conscious

19   decision on the part of the industry to take

20   advantage of that knowledge for their economic

21   benefit?

22             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that would call

23        for interpretation of the documents.

24             MR. SCAROLA: I don't believe it does,

25        your Honor. I think it's an area appropriate 4333

1        for opinion from this witness.

2             THE COURT: I'll have you rephrase the

3        question.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Do the documents themselves expressly

6   acknowledge, on the part of the industry, a

7   conscious decision to take advantage of the fact

8   that a cigarette is the most serious obstacle,

9   cigarette design is the most serious obstacle to

10   breaking the cycle of nicotine addiction to take

11    advantage of that knowledge for purposes of profit?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, argumentative,

13        and the same objection previously expressed.

14             THE COURT: I'll allow the question as

15        long as it's couched in terms of the witness'

16        opinion as to the implications of the document.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   You do understand the question,

20   Dr. Cummings?

21         A.   Yes. My opinion, the documents do

22   expressly state that that was a key factor in how

23   they designed their cigarettes, with knowledge that

24   they needed to maintain a minimum amount of nicotine

25   to keep people smoking rather than giving them the 4334

1    choice to quit, because they also talk about the

2   fact that most smokers would leave them, if they

3   could.

4        Q.   Based upon your review of those documents,

5   do you have an opinion as to whether the tobacco

6   industry was pleased with the addictive nature of

7   nicotine in cigarettes or is that something that

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=116
8   they just didn't like?

9             MR. KELLY: Objection as previously stated

10        to the interpretation of documents, your Honor,

11         calling for speculation.

12             THE COURT: I'll overrule the objection.

13        The witness can answer, if he can.

14        A.   Yes, my opinion is the documents expressly

15   state that the companies were happy that cigarettes

16   were addictive and something that smokers could not

17   give up easily, and they talked about this in the

18   documents that I reviewed.

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Are those documents that you're prepared

21    to show us today?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   Through your professional work, are you

24   familiar with the mortality numbers associated with

25   cigarettes? 4335

1        A.   I am.

2        Q.   What does "mortality numbers" mean?

3        A.   Basically related to cigarettes as the

4   number of deaths that are attributed to smoking

5   cigarettes.

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to this line of

7        inquiry, your Honor, cumulative and 403.

8             THE COURT: Overruled.

9             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this violates

10        Williams/State Farm, as we previously

11         indicated.

12             THE COURT: Is counsel seeking an

13        instruction?

14             MR. KELLY: I'll wait for the testimony,

15        your Honor, but I think I know what the

16        testimony is going to be. I should wait until

17        I hear it. It may be time for the morning

18        break.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I'm almost at a point I can

20        end this line of inquiry and move into another

21         area.

22             THE COURT: Does counsel want to approach?

23             MR. SCAROLA: I thought that they --

24             MR. KELLY: My objection has been stated.

25        If it's overruled, I don't want to interrupt 4336

1        before the break.

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   Can you tell us, please, Dr. Cummings, how

4   many Americans have been killed as a consequence of

5   nicotine addiction since the issuance of the 1964

6   Surgeon General's report?

7             MR. KELLY: I'd like to have a continuing

8        objection to this, your Honor, under

9        Williams/State Farm, no nexus to Mr. Piendle.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=117
10             THE COURT: Continuing objection is noted.

11              MR. KELLY: Thank you.

12             THE COURT: Overruled.

13             You may answer, if you can.

14        A.   I don't know the actual number, it's

15   millions. I know the number who died in the last

16   century is a hundred million from smoking.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   How many, on a daily basis, in the United

19   States alone?

20        A.   Today, on a daily basis, it's over a

21    thousand people dying every day. There are 440,000

22   deaths attributed to cigarette smoking every year in

23   the United States. Worldwide, it's about 5 million

24   deaths every year. So you can calculate that by

25   day. 4337

1              MR. KELLY: Move to strike as

2        nonresponsive, your Honor, and there's no

3        foundation for any of this testimony that's

4        been laid in the record.

5             THE COURT: Overruled.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Are these matters that have been studied

8   and tracked by the National Cancer Institute?

9        A.   They have.

10        Q.   What is NCI?

11         A.   The National Cancer Institute is a part of

12   the National Institutes of Health, which is our

13   government's group that funds biomedical research in

14   the United States, and the National Cancer Institute

15   is the largest of those institutes and it's devoted

16   to research on cancer.

17        Q.   Did the National Cancer Institute become

18   specifically interested in studying heavy smokers?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   Why?

21         A.   Because they have the highest mortality

22   from cigarette smoking. So it's a dose response.

23   Those who smoke more, you know, tend to have a

24   higher mortality, particularly cancer, about 90 to

25   95 percent of male lung cancers are due to smoking, 4338

1    and about a third of all cancers. So it's a big

2   area that NCI focuses on. And heavy smokers,

3   because of the higher mortality burden, they funded

4   a major research initiative in the 1980s that I was

5   a part of to try to change smoking patterns in heavy

6   smokers.

7        Q.   What is the percentage of all regular

8   smokers who begin to smoke before age 18?

9        A.   It's about two-thirds regular smoking. So

10   if you just look at experimentation, picking up a

11    cigarette is about 90 percent. But if you look at

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=118
12   regular smoking, it's about two-thirds of adults

13   report that they began their smoking careers before

14   the age of 18.

15        Q.   What, if any, relationship exists between

16   the age at which one begins to smoke and the

17   likelihood of nicotine addiction?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, cumulative,

19        not only with this witness, but prior

20        witnesses.

21              THE COURT: I do believe that was covered.

22        I'll sustain.

23     BY MR. SCAROLA:

24        Q.   Does the age at which one begins to smoke

25   affect how long someone continues to smoke? 4339

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   How?

3        A.   The earlier you start to smoke, the harder

4   it is to quit. We find that those who start earlier

5   also report that they smoke more, that they have

6   other indicators of nicotine dependence, such as

7   smoking first thing in the morning, more frequent

8   past quit efforts. They tend to also experience

9   more withdrawal when they do quit. So -- and then

10   they end up with more years of exposure. So it

11    relates to mortality. So age of initiation is a

12   factor that we've looked at in our research, because

13   it relates to cancer risk at the other end.

14        Q.   Have those facts played a significant role

15   in the business practices of the tobacco industry?

16        A.   They have.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I think that it

18        is 11:15 and that's a good place for us.

19             THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

20        we will take our midmorning break. We'll be in

21         recess until 11:30. Please remember the

22        important instruction not to discuss the case

23        or have any contact with anyone associated with

24        the case. No viewing of any media coverage,

25        should there be any, that you have contact with 4340

1         over the break.

2             I remind the witness you remain under oath

3        and not to discuss your testimony with anyone

4        over the break, and we'll see everyone back

5        after 11:30.

6             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

7        after which the following proceedings were

8        held:)

9             THE COURT: Okay. So is counsel ready to

10        get into the documents now?

11              MR. HENK: We want to make a motion,

12        your Honor.

13             THE COURT: Just a minute. Let me finish

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=119
14        my question. Is that the intent of the

15        remaining portion of your direct examination of

16        the witness is simply go through documents in

17        the notebook?

18             MR. SCAROLA: There may be some brief

19        wrap-up after the documents, but that's

20        primarily what we will be doing.

21              THE COURT: Do you suspect you can do that

22        before the lunch hour?

23             MR. SCAROLA: No, but I think we're going

24        to get through most of it before the lunch

25        hour. 4341

1              THE COURT: I'd like to still try to keep

2        with as close to the plan as possible, which is

3        allowing the defense to get on with their cross

4        today of Dr. Cummings, per the schedule that

5        was presented to the Court. So that's what I'd

6        like to see happen.

7             MR. SCAROLA: We'll move through as

8        rapidly as we can.

9             THE COURT: What is the motion?

10             MS. KESSLER: Reynolds moves for a

11         mistrial based on testimony that violates

12        Reilly. May I approach and hand you a copy of

13        the Reilly decision, which is 533 U.S. 525. It

14        was cited in our pretrial motions. I'll hand a

15        copy to plaintiffs counsel as well, but they

16        have seen it in our motions in limine.

17             Reilly is directly on point. Reilly

18        addressed point of sale advertising, billboard

19        advertising, and what the U.S. Supreme Court

20        found in Reilly that criticisms of those types

21         of advertising, they could not be upheld

22        because it was all preempted, and your Honor

23        will see the quotation from Reilly that makes

24        this clear that Congress preempted state

25        cigarette advertising regulations, like the 4342

1         attorney general, it was addressing the

2        Massachusetts attorney general had tried to

3        replace restrictions on point of sale and

4        billboards, and Supreme Court said that the

5        Massachusetts attorney general could not do

6        that because such restrictions would violate

7        preemptions.

8             And so we wanted to make a mistrial

9        motion. We heard the witness testify about

10        billboards, we heard the witness testify about

11        point of sale. Your Honor overruled the

12        defendants' objection based on Reilly to that

13        testimony and so the only remedy for this

14        incredibly prejudicial testimony is a mistrial.

15             THE COURT: Okay. Response?

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=120
16             MR. SCAROLA: We are not basing a claim on

17        advertising. I think that's all the response

18        that we need. It's clearly relevant and

19        material with regard to what Mr. Piendle was

20        exposed to, the knowledge that he had in order

21         for this jury to judge issues of comparative

22        negligence.

23             MS. KESSLER: And the points of placement,

24        particularly tied to minors is exactly what the

25        U.S. Supreme Court said that liability could 4343

1        not be found, but that is the opinions they

2        elicited from this witness and it is clearly

3        preempted.

4             MR. HENK: May I add, your Honor, that

5        what Mr. Scarola just said is going to be

6        belied by what this witness is going to say on

7        the stand, assuming he testifies consistently

8        with what I asked in his deposition, which

9        there is no evidence that Mr. Piendle saw any

10        of the advertising that he's going to go

11         through. No nexus is going to be established

12        whatsoever, and Mr. Scarola just stated that's

13        the only relevance to this information. And

14        then if your Honor is heard that and is ready

15        to rule, I have a separate motion for mistrial.

16             THE COURT: We're going to take a break

17        now. So I'm going to rule on the motion for

18        mistrial. It is denied. Should defense seek

19        any type of instruction that you believe, even

20        though your first set of request for relief is

21         a mistrial, in face of the Court not granting

22        that, if there's any instructive -- any

23        curative or other type of limiting instruction

24        that defense requests other than what the Court

25        has read regarding commercial speech and 4344

1        protection of first amendment, the Court will

2        entertain it and ask that you give it after

3        break and we're going to take our break now.

4             MR. HENK: I can make our motion for

5        mistrial a separate motion after the break?

6             THE COURT: Yes. We'll be in recess until

7         11:30.

8             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

9         11:20 a.m. until 11:34 a.m., after which the

10        following proceedings were held:)

11              MR. HENK: Am I making my motion now, your

12        Honor?

13             THE COURT: Well, you've made your motion

14        for mistrial. You can argue it later. Is it

15        on the same basis?

16             MR. HENK: No, it's different grounds.

17             THE COURT: What are the grounds?

18             MR. HENK: And I need to have Dr. Cummings

19        not be present for the presentation of this.

20             THE COURT: Well, you preserved your right

21         to make it, and I'm not going to have

22        Dr. Cummings leave at this time. I'll have the

23        jury come in.

24             And you haven't waived any issue if it

25        doesn't involve the Court being able to make 4345

1         any kind of a curative instruction at this

2        point, which was the point of making the

3        comment I did last time that I would like you

4        to make it at that time, then we'll take it up

5        over the lunch hour.

6             Was there a curative instruction that any

7        counsel wanted?

8             MS. KESSLER: Yes, your Honor. Reynolds

9        would like a curative instruction.

10             THE COURT: What is the curative

11         instruction?

12             MS. KESSLER: I'm reading from the

13        transcript in response to our mistrial motion.

14             Plaintiffs counsel told the Court, quote,

15        we are not basing a claim on advertising,

16        closed quote. That is the curative instruction

17        Reynolds would like read to the jury.

18             THE COURT: What is the response?

19             MR. SCAROLA: I think that your Honor's

20        instruction has appropriately covered that

21         issue, and we are basing a claim on the fact

22        that the industry in general has deceptively

23        omitted information from all of its statements

24        to the general public, including Charlie

25        Piendle. 4346

1              THE COURT: Okay. What is -- what was the

2        defense proposal?

3             MS. KESSLER: It is a direct quote from

4        plaintiffs counsel. "Plaintiff is not basing

5        a claim on advertising."

6             THE COURT: And let's see. And what is

7        plaintiffs response?

8             MR. SCAROLA: Plaintiffs response is that

9        our claims are those claims that are stated in

10        the complaint.

11              THE COURT: Wait. Do you have a copy of

12        that? That's what I was trying to put my hands

13        on.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sure we can secure one.

15        I don't have it immediately in hand.

16             But I would suggest that this is not a

17        matter that needs to be dealt with at the

18        present time. If such an instruction is to be

19        given, it can be considered at the close of

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=122
20        this case, and there is no curative instruction

21         that needs to relate to any specific testimony

22        at the present time.

23             MR. SALES: I would just add, there's a

24        very substantial subtlety with respect to the

25        difference between concealment and 4347

1        misrepresentation. If we're going to do this,

2        we need to do it in accordance with what Engle

3        leaves us as to what the plaintiffs claims

4        actually are.

5             Counsel's statement about what we said

6        based on advertising omits all of the

7        information Mr. Scarola identified about the

8        importance of the advertising environment in

9        relation to the actions of Mr. Piendle, but the

10        issue of concealment goes directly to the

11         question of whether or not adequate health

12        information was included in the company's

13        commercial messages that were everywhere, which

14        the Court and the jury has heard substantial

15        testimony about. That instruction, if given,

16        would be entirely misleading and inappropriate.

17             MR. HENK: Your Honor, if I believe I

18        heard Mr. Sales right, repeating what

19        Mr. Scarola said to your Honor as an officer of

20        the Court about the claims in this case would

21        be misleading to the jury.

22             MR. SALES: If it didn't include

23        everything else Mr. Scarola said, yes.

24             MR. HENK: I'm sorry. May I finish, since

25        they've now had two counsel speak? 4348

1              THE COURT: Mr. Henk, did you need to make

2        a motion, and if so, what is it?

3             MR. HENK: Your Honor, again, I need --

4             THE COURT: No, I'm not going to have you

5        do that. I'm not going to have Dr. Cummings

6        leave.

7             MS. KESSLER: Your Honor, if I could hand

8        to the Court, I'm just going to hand you, I

9        understand it's not controlling, it's a

10        California Supreme Court case, In re: Tobacco

11         Cases III, but it applies Reilly, and it

12        specifically finds, and I believe it's the

13        testimony that we were objecting to and you

14        just heard, it's on point.

15             In applying Reilly, the California Supreme

16        Court found that plaintiffs alleging that

17        defendants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris

18        conducted marketing surveys to determine how

19        best to induce teenagers age 13 to 17 to begin

20        smoking; that defendants designed

21         advertisements and marketing campaigns to

22        appeal to minors; and that those campaigns

23        included placing advertisements near schools,

24        playgrounds, video arcades, and youth-oriented

25        publication. 4349

1              The defendants sponsored sporting events

2        and concerts that appealed to minors, and

3        finally, that defendants paid to have their

4        products used in films that appeal to youth

5        audiences.

6             That's is exactly the testimony under

7        Reilly that is preempted, and your Honor, I was

8        going to --just for some examples, I was going

9        to provide that case to the Court as well.

10             THE COURT: I'm going to have us continue

11         at this point and give thought to the

12        instruction so it's not rushed. So we'll have

13        the jury brought in, and I'll look further into

14        any kind of instruction based on recommendation

15        by counsel.

16             MR. HENK: Your Honor, I object to not

17        being able to present the motion for mistrial

18        and not in the presence of Dr. Cummings.

19             THE COURT: You will be able to do it, but

20        not at this point.

21              MR. HENK: It's overruled then?

22             THE COURT: Having Dr. Cummings leave the

23        courtroom now, yes.

24             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor requested a copy

25        of the complaint. 4350

1              THE COURT: Thank you. I have two copies.

2        I just couldn't put my fingers on it.

3             (Thereupon, the jury entered the

4        courtroom, after which the following

5        proceedings were held:)

6             THE COURT: Okay. Welcome back, you may

7        be seated.

8             Counsel, you can proceed.

9             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much,

10        your Honor.

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   Dr. Cummings, does the tobacco industry

13   have a term for children who smoke?

14        A.   A term for children who smoke?

15        Q.   Yes.

16        A.   They have a variety of terms that I have

17   found in my research for teenage smokers.

18   Replacement smokers, prelearners, learners, FUBYAS,

19   first usual brand young adult smoker, young adult

20   smoker. There are a variety of those terms that I

21    found in my research of their business records.

22        Q.   We have put together a notebook of

23   documents that you have relied upon and referenced

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=124
24   as having relied upon early in your testimony,

25   correct? 4351

1        A.   That's right.

2        Q.   And you have a copy of that in front of

3   you, a copy has been provided to the Court and to

4   opposing counsel.

5             MR. SCAROLA: And your Honor, I would like

6        at this time to move into evidence Exhibit

7        No. 3400.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: The objections have been

9        filed, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: 34 -- where would I find that?

11              MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, all of the

12        exhibits are in numerical order in the notebook

13        that's been provided to the Court.

14             THE COURT: Let me just take a look at it.

15             Counsel was referring to the written

16        objections that were submitted when you said

17        the objections had been noted?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor. I just

19        want to confirm that this is one of the ones.

20             THE COURT: Yes, let me just take a look

21         at it.

22             Okay. Let's see, what was the date of

23        this?

24             MR. SCAROLA: The date was February 29,

25         1984. 4352

1              THE COURT: It's a research report. Does

2        it relate to different time periods?

3             MR. SCAROLA: It does, your Honor.

4             THE COURT: So not necessarily just

5        restricted to . . .

6             MR. SCAROLA: That's correct. It gives a

7        historical perspective as well.

8             THE COURT: Does it encompass, as well,

9        periods of the '50s?

10             MR. SCAROLA: It makes reference back to

11         the'50s.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I don't

13        believe that's accurate.

14             MR. SCAROLA: We'll be happy to show the

15        specific sections that make those references.

16             THE COURT: Why don't counsel approach and

17        show me.

18             MR. SCAROLA: May I save --

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: Okay. So let me just be

22        clear, it's internal report strategies

23        regarding young adult smokers.

24             My first question, is there anything that

25        relates to the strategy of the tobacco --1

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=125
4353

1         guess it's the marketing development department

2        at RJ. Reynolds as relates to marketing

3        strategies during the '50s to youth?

4             MR. SCAROLA: If your Honor takes a look

5        at page 8, successful first brand strategies of

6        the past, you will see that there are

7        references to the last 50 years having been

8        analyzed.

9             THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to allow the

10        document in over objection. However, to the

11         extent there are portions of it that don't

12        relate to the time period in which Mr. Piendle

13        was a youth, if defense is requesting the

14        Williams instruction, the Court would entertain

15        that request.

16             Is anyone from defense requesting that?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me reserve on that.

18        I think this is going to arise with a number of

19        documents, and I think it may be better to do

20        it at the end rather than seriatim.

21              THE COURT: That will be the ruling. If

22        there are documents relating to youth, area of

23        youth marketing strategies, or internal

24        documents to speak to what the company was

25        doing towards youth during Mr. Piendle's youth, 4354

1        I'm going to allow it in without any

2        limitation, but it also extends, beyond that in

3        my opinion, and subject to the instruction you

4        want read.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I understand.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I agree that it is not

7        necessary to make a contemporaneous objection

8        for purposes of drawing distinction, and we can

9        give a blanket instruction at the end of the

10        testimony without your having raised the issue

11         with regard to each document. Otherwise, it's

12        going to take us a very long time.

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: What I intend to do,

14        your Honor, I think objections that were filed,

15        we'll refer to filed objections, they cover

16        nearly every document that Mr. Scarola intends

17        to use. There may be one or two exceptions.

18        But when the exceptions arise, I'll articulate

19        the basis; otherwise, I'll refer to the filed

20        instructions in order to expedite things.

21              THE COURT: Just let me know whenever you

22        want any kind of limiting instruction read.

23             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

24        concluded and the following proceedings were

25        held within the presence of the jury:) 4355

1            THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=126
2             It is admitted over objection. So let's

3        just make a note of this. This is 3400?

4             MR. SCAROLA: That's correct, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Okay. Plaintiff s 3400

6        admitted over objection.

7             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

8        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

9        Exhibit 3400.)

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   Would you tell us, please, Doctor, whether

12   this particular document serves to give us an

13   overview of the industry's awareness and use of the

14   significance of youth smoking?

15             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor,

16        overbroad with respect to the industry.

17             THE COURT: Can you rephrase, more narrow?

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   Does this document specifically give us an

20   overview of the significance and use by

21    R.J. Reynolds of issues relating to youth smoking?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   Does it extend beyond that to apply

24   industry wide?

25        A.   Yes. It also talks about brands from 4356

1   Philip Morris.

2        Q.   All right. Now, what is the document

3   we're looking at?

4        A.   This a document written by Diane Burrows,

5   who is a market analyst.

6        Q.   Employed by R.J. Reynolds?

7        A.   Employed by R.J. Reynolds.

8             And it's to Gerald Long, who is the

9   president and C.E.O. of R.J. Reynolds; Martin

10   Orlowsky, who at the time was vice president for

11    marketing at Reynolds; and Mr. Lees, who was vice

12   president for products and new brands, plus a copy

13   to a variety of other people. Mr. Paul, who is a

14   vice president for marketing is also copied on it.

15             And essentially it's a document about the

16   50-year history of brands that were successful with

17   the youth market.

18        Q.   Okay. Call our attention, please,

19   specifically to those sections in this document that

20   you found to be most significant, understanding that

21    the entire document will be in evidence and

22   available for the jury to review in its entirety,

23   but all we want to do right now, because of the

24   limited time, is look at the highlights.

25        A.   Sure. I would go to page I under 4357

1    "Management summary."

2        Q.   Is that Roman numeral V or page 5?

3        A.   It's actually page I. It's an intro to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=127
4   this about 84-page report, it's a long report, that

5   is giving the management summary of what the

6   document actually has reviewed, and it talks about

7   the importance of the young adult smokers and

8   indicates that young adults --

9        Q.   Well, rather than tell us what it

10   indicates, let's tell us what it said.

11         A.   Sure.  "The importance of younger adult

12   smokers. Younger adult smokers have been the

13   critical factor in the growth and decline of every

14   major brand and company over the last 50 years, and

15   they will continue to be just as important to brands

16   and companies in the future for two simple reasons.

17              "The renewal of the market stems almost

18   entirely from 18-year-old smokers, and that no more

19   than 5 percent of smokers start after the age of 24.

20             "Secondly, the brand loyalty of

21    18-year-old smokers far outweighs any tendency to

22   switch with age."

23        Q.   Where do we go next?

24        A.   We go to page 2 of this document. This is

25   in Section 1, page 2. And it's talking about the 4358

1   volume, under "Volume" there, No. 1.

2             It says, "Younger adult smokers are the

3   only source of replacement smokers. Repeated

4   government studies" -- and they refer to an appendix

5   in this document, Appendix B -- "have shown that

6   less than one-third of smokers, 31 percent, start

7   after the age 18."

8        Q.   Which confirms your earlier testimony that

9   two-thirds begin before age 18.

10        A.   Exactly.

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, bolstering.

12             THE COURT: Overruled.

13        A.   And only 5 percent of smokers start after

14   age 24.

15             So the next page to go to is Appendix B.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   It is Bates No. 5019285 -

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: 26,1 believe, Jack.

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Well, probably 25 and then 26.

21         A.   That's not the right page.

22        Q.   The next one, the one with the bar graph?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Okay. That's 8526.

25        A.   So this is reporting just what they had 4359

1    stated in that section on who are the 18-year-old

2   smokers. It's really people under the age of 18 is

3   what they're referring to in this document, and they

4   call them younger adults, importance as replacement

5   smokers.

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection as to

7        interpretation. Move to strike.

8             THE COURT: I'll sustain as far as the

9        witness is interpreting the document.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   Let's just read what these numbers are.

12             This is percentage line, correct?

13        A.   That's correct.

14        Q.   This is an age line?

15        A.   That's correct.

16        Q.   It starts at what age?

17        A.   Thirteen.

18        Q.   And then what age?

19        A.   Fourteen.

20        Q.   And then what age?

21         A.   Fifteen.

22        Q.   Then what age?

23        A.   Sixteen.

24        Q.   Then what age?

25        A.   Seventeen. 4360

1         Q.   What is the highest percentage, in which

2   age group, where people start to smoke based on this

3   bar graph?

4        A.   Basically 16 and 17.

5        Q.   And they have tracked smokers beginning at

6   age 13, correct?

7        A.   That's correct.

8        Q.   And could you read this for us in terms of

9   the percentages, what percentage of smokers begin at

10   age 13?

11         A.   It's less than 5 percent. It's about 4 --

12   about 4 percent or so.

13        Q.   Okay. And 14?

14        A.   Move that up, it's about 7 1/2, 8 percent.

15        Q.   15 -- I'm sorry, 15?

16        A.   9 percent.

17        Q.   And going to 16 and 17?

18        A.   You're up about 13 percent, and then you

19   accumulate these. And actually there's a chart

20   below on this page.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Go right below that, if you

22        would, please, for us, Keith.

23        A.   And so that's where they come up with the

24   two-thirds figure. They also get a median age for

25   starting to smoke. This is starting to smoke 4361

1   regularly, by the way, and comes from an HEW data

2   report, as you can see the source there.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   HEW, Health, Education and Welfare, a

5   department of the United States Government?

6        A.   That's correct.

7        Q.   Where do we go next?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=129
8        A.   We go to page 8477, last four digits,

9   Section 2.

10        Q.   And that is page No. 8 of the report,

11   begins "Successful first brand strategies of the

12   past," correct?

13        A.   Correct.

14        Q.   Okay. Point out the significant sections

15   here if you would, please, as soon as we get it up

16   on the board. 8478, page 8 of the report.

17        A.   Okay. So this is just the heading here,

18   and this section of the report talks about the

19   successful first brand strategies of the past. So

20   it goes over a 50-year period. So it goes back in

21    time to the period when Mr. Piendle was starting to,

22   you know, smoke.

23             MR. SCAROLA: Go to the next page, please,

24        Keith. And enlarge the first paragraph for us,

25        if you would, please. 4362

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   And let's go through that language where

3   we know that what they're talking about is a 50-year

4   retrospective.

5        A.   That's right.

6        Q.   It says, "By using these responses to

7   represent the younger adult market of the past, the

8   rise and fall of key young adult brands over the

9   last 50 years can be analyzed." Correct?

10        A.   That's correct.

11         Q.   All right. What was of significance in

12   that analysis?

13        A.   Well, what was of significance is that two

14   of the brands that Mr. Piendle was smoking, Winston

15   and Marlboro, have reports in here talking about

16   their success of those brands, picking up a share of

17   the teen market.

18             And if you go to the report on Winston,

19   which is on page 12, it's --

20        Q.   8482 Bates number.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: If I may just object to

22        the response, which included interpretation as

23        opposed to looking at the document itself --

24             MR. SCAROLA: We're only going to read it.

25             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me finish the 4363

1         objection, please. It speaks for itself.

2             THE COURT: The interpretation of the

3        document, if it's clear on its face, cannot be

4        testified to, but the witness can refer to

5        which portion of the document.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Let's just read the very first line on

8   this page.  "Winston, the hit of the 1950s and

9    1960s."

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=130
10             The report then identifies what it calls

11    "external influences in the 1950s contributed to the

12   Winston opportunity."

13             Read the next line for us.

14        A.   "The rising tide of health concern, which

15   peaked with the cancer scare of 1954."

16        Q.   And go to the next paragraph if you would,

17   please, and read that to us, please, Dr. Cummings.

18        A.   Sure.  "Although modern filtered

19   cigarettes had been in the U.S. market since 1936,

20   their market importance was almost nil until the

21    early 1950s when Viceroy sales quadrupled in less

22   than two years. Reynolds, determined not to repeat

23   its experience introducing Cavalier against an

24   already too well-entrenched Pall Mall, rushed

25   Winston to market in March of 1954, near the crest 4364

1    of the health scare."

2        Q.   Go down to the third paragraph, which

3   begins "Younger adult and older smokers."

4        A.   Sure.  "Younger adult and older smokers

5   alike respond promptly to Winston's positive

6   proposition, Winston tastes good, its point of

7   difference from other filtered brands, and the

8   product efficiency nonfilter smokers might suspect.

9   Winston let Kent and Viceroy sell the benefits of

10   filters and perhaps make themselves look like sissy

11   brands to young adult smokers seeking maturity."

12        Q.   What else did you find significant on this

13   page?

14        A.   If you look at the chart at the bottom,

15   the chart at the bottom basically shows -- the dash

16   line is that 18 and under group, called the 18

17   share, and the market share for Winston is the dark

18   line. So the overall market versus the young adult

19   smoker share of Winston.

20             And you can see the rapid growth of

21   Winston cigarettes introduced in March of 1954 took

22   off and was particularly popular with younger adult

23   smokers who switched to filters in large numbers,

24   and peaked in the 1960s, which is why they use the

25   title. The title reads, "The hit of 1950s and 4365

1    1960s, Winston."

2        Q.   In case there was any --

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: Excuse me, Mr. Scarola.

4             Objection to that portion of the answer

5        that suggests that these are data other than

6         18-year-old market share data as interpreting

7        the document and doing so incorrectly.

8             THE COURT: Sustained.

9             MR. SCAROLA: I can lay a predicate,

10        your Honor.

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=131
12        Q.   Have you cross-referenced this chart to

13   the statistics upon which the chart was based?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   Was the reference to 18-year-old share a

16   reference to individuals who were 18 years old, or

17   did it relate to any broader group of individuals?

18        A.   It was in reference to people who had

19   started smoking before and up to age 18, based on

20   the research that I had done of the aging of the

21    National Family Opinion Poll and their other data

22   that they have collected for using and creating

23   these charts.

24        Q.   In case there was any doubt about RJR's

25   awareness of the influence of peer pressure, would 4366

1   you please read the sentence right above the chart.

2             MR. SCAROLA:  Show it to us please, Keith,

3        and enlarge that. The sentence that begins

4        "Winston's effect."

5        A.   "By 1958, Winston was the No. 1 filter

6   brand and still showing steady market share gains.

7   In the early 1960s, its share among 18-year-old

8   smokers reached some 30 percent, twice as high as

9   the market share. Winston's effect on Salem and

10   Marlboro during the early 1960s, as shown later in

11    this document, suggests that this 30 percent share

12   was large enough to put peer pressure on Winston's

13   side and make it a bandwagon brand among younger

14   adult smokers."

15        Q.   All right, sir. Is there anything else of

16   major significance in this report in which you want

17   to call our attention to? Remembering, please, that

18   we can only look at the highlights right now.

19        A.   I would highlight No. 2, the spread of

20   television.

21         Q.   On which Bates number page?

22        A.   Same page.

23        Q.   Same page, okay.

24        A.   And it just talks about Winston was

25   introduced on TV, and it points out a fad that 4367

1    spread from 9 percent of the households in 1950 to

2   87 percent by 1960, that is households with

3   televisions, "Advertising dollars were a key

4   advantage for Winston over its filter competitors,

5   and the bulk of those dollars were used to leverage

6   TV." So it's giving an idea of its execution.

7             And then if you go to page 8485.

8        Q.   Key points about Winston?

9        A.   Correct. It points out a number of the

10   reasons that Winston was successful. No. 1, Winston

11   benefited from the health scares of the 1950, which

12   created the filter boom. It used a positive

13   position, Winston tastes good, to capitalize on the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=132
14   negative environment. It talks about peer pressure,

15   fifth bullet down.

16             The bandwagon effect seems to have worked

17   for Winston in the early 1960s, when it had a

18   30 percent share of younger adult smokers, and other

19   items there, but there are a number of reasons why

20   it worked. So Winston came in with the filter, it

21    attracted young people, and was highly successful.

22        Q.   All right, sir. Anything else with

23   respect to this particular document?

24        A.   Yes. The very next page, 8486, talks

25   about Marlboro. 4368

1         Q.   All right. And point out, if you would,

2   please, those portions of most significance to you

3   on this page.

4        A.   It talks about the success of Marlboro,

5   which was also introduced or remade as a filtered

6   cigarette introduced in 1954, and it talks about the

7   baby bubble brand. The leading edge of the baby

8   bubble exploded on society as the younger adults of

9   the 1960s, over 30 was out and younger set was

10   driving fashions, politics, and marketplace

11    sometimes violently, and Marlboro would become their

12   brand.

13             And if you go down to the third paragraph,

14   where it says "judging."

15        Q.   Yes, sir.

16        A.   "Judging by its copy, Marlboro's masculine

17   positioning was originally directed at the nonfilter

18   market in the early 1950s, which had become

19   overdeveloped among males as it declined. It took

20   eight years of experimentation of Marlboros'

21   permanent cowboy campaign to fall in place in 1962.

22   Even then, the Winston bandwagon held Marlboro at

23   bay."

24        Q.   It was in 1962 that the Marlboro Man

25   became a permanent fixture in the advertising of 4369

1   this brand, correct?

2        A.   That's correct.

3        Q.   All right, sir. Next?

4        A.   If you go to key points on page 8491, it

5   points out at the bottom, in 1970, and, in fact, the

6   very last point on that page, it talks about

7   switching.

8             So it's the Marlboro smokers, the young

9   adult Marlboro smokers and Winston smokers aged into

10   the '70s, they would switch to brands and they talk

11    about Marlboro's success in getting them to switch

12   to brands that Philip Morris made, one of which was

13   Merit, and that was relevant in terms of my review

14   because Mr. Piendle, you know, went from smoking

15   nonfiltered Lucky Strikes early on to Winston and

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=133
16   Marlboro, and then Raleigh for a brief period and

17   then Doral, a low-tar brand and Merit, and this is

18   essentially described as one of the reasons that

19   Philip Morris maintained market share overall for

20   Marlboro smokers, and one of the reasons that their

21    share increased over the time period that this

22   report covers.

23        Q.   And, again, in the unhighlighted portion,

24   just above what we have highlighted there, it says,

25    "Marlboro is a bandwagon brand today," and it also 4370

1   talks about, "Marlboro stands for the average

2   younger adult, peer popularity is its added

3   benefit."

4        A.   Correct.

5        Q.   All right, sir. Anything else of special

6   significance that you wish to call our attention to

7   with regard to this document?

8        A.   No.

9        Q.   Good. Let's go to Exhibit 3570.

10             MR. SCAROLA: Which I would move into

11         evidence before we display that, your Honor.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Filed objections,

13        your Honor.

14             THE COURT: What is the William Esty

15        Company?

16             MR. SCAROLA: I would be happy to

17        establish that predicate, your Honor.

18             THE COURT: Okay.

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Dr. Cummings, can you explain to us,

21   please, what the William Esty Company is or was and

22   the relationship that it had to the tobacco industry

23   in general and these defendants in particular?

24        A.   William Esty was an advertising company

25   hired by R.J. Reynolds to basically design and place 4371

1    advertising for Winston cigarettes in the 1950s.

2             MR. SCAROLA: Is that sufficient for

3        your Honor's purposes?

4             THE COURT: So I'll admit 3570 over

5        objection.

6             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

7        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

8        Exhibit 3570.)

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   Keith, would you please put up the first

11   page and highlight for us the title.

12             The Youth Research Institute Study

13   Regarding Cigarette Smoking Among 7,521 High School

14   and College Students in 80 Cities Throughout the

15   United States, October through November 1959,

16   Summary of Findings. And the report is dated

17   December of 1959.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=134
18             Where should we look to identify those

19   portions of this document that you found to be of

20   significance?

21         A.   This is an entire report, but if you go to

22   Table 1, it looks at the incidence of cigarette

23   smoking.

24        Q.   Page 3725, first page of the report.

25        A.   And I would highlight high school 4372

1    students -- actually, if you go to the junior,

2   senior class, because that would correspond to the

3   age group for Mr. Piendle.

4        Q.   And it covers not only 1959, but 1958 as

5   well, correct?

6        A.   Right, I have another report for 1958,

7   obviously, they're looking at trends and William

8   Esty Company had purchased these surveys, and so

9   they were -- they were provided to them and provide

10   information on the incidence of smoking and also the

11   brand choices of young people that were surveyed.

12        Q.   So this is a survey that was conducted in

13    1958 and 1959 of Charlie Piendle's cohort?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   Okay. What does it tell us?

16        A.   Well, it tells us that there are a large

17   share of teenagers in 1958 and 1959 were smoking,

18   particularly among young men. If you look at the

19   percentages of young men in junior, senior class, in

20    1959, the percentage who smoked was 65 percent, in

21    '58 it was 68 percent.

22        Q.   Let me hand you, if I could -- my truly

23   high-tech pointer has disappeared, but this is a

24   laser pointer. We'll have to make do with that.

25   You could help us, if you would, please, by pointing 4373

1    exactly to where we're focusing our attention.

2        A.   It would be right there, where it's been

3   highlighted. So it's showing that roughly

4   two-thirds, these are juniors and seniors in high

5   school that smoke. If you go down on the page, it's

6   talking about college age students and the rates go

7   up a little higher, but not that much. So it's

8   showing that most of the smoking that was going on

9   in this age cohort was, you know, pretty high in

10   junior and senior. Overall, it's in the high 50s

11    among -- overall for boys and girls. Among young

12   men, it was in the low 60s, if you include the

13   freshman, sophomore class.

14             So this is not really that unusual when

15   you see rates of smoking increasing during that 12

16   to 18-year-old period, more and more people

17   continued to smoke very consistent with the prior

18   chart that Diane Burrows had included in her review.

19        Q.   This also, as you mentioned earlier, goes

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=135
20   on in subsequent pages to look at the distribution

21    of those smokers that were surveyed by brand and

22   tracks that by percentages of each of the groups

23   that are identified in this overall chart, correct?

24        A.   Right. Table 3 provides brand, current

25   type, and brand preference. 4374

1         Q.   Well, we're not going to take the time to

2   look at those right now, except to know that the

3   information is there relating to the specific brands

4   that have been mentioned in earlier testimony.

5             So let's go, if we could, from 3570 on to

6   Exhibit No. 1535, and is this one of the documents

7   that you specifically relied upon, Dr. Cummings --

8             THE COURT:  1533.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   1533, that's correct, I apologize.

11              Thank you, Keith.

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   And tell us, if you would, please, before

14   we see the document, identify this for us.

15        A.   This is the letter from Mr. George

16   MacGovern to an Archie Sugg at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

17   Company. Mr. Sugg was in the marketing department

18   at R.J. Reynolds and Mr. MacGovern was an employee

19   of the William Esty corporation that had done the

20   surveys and, essentially, this is a communication

21    reporting the results, the report of the surveys

22   that had been done in 1959. So it shows that these

23   were being shared with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

24   Company.

25        Q.   All right. 4375

1              MR. SCAROLA: We would move this into

2        evidence at this time, your Honor.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: Filed objections,

4        your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Move it in over objection.

6             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

7        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

8        Exhibit 1533.)

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   And just put that up so we can see it

11    quickly, Keith.

12             Highlight, if you would, please, the

13   person to whom it is addressed. We know -- we can

14   see here that it's going to Mr. Sugg at

15   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. It's from an

16   individual whose name is George MacGovern, and he is

17   signing on behalf of the William Esty Company. This

18   simply is the cover letter forwarding the report

19   that we just saw, correct?

20        A.   That's right. It's on letterhead for

21   William Esty.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=136
22             MR. SCAROLA: We want to go through a

23        group of representative ads at this time, and

24        these are going to be shown simply for

25        demonstrative purposes, and as a group, Keith, 4376

1        what is our next exhibit for demonstrative

2        purposes? Which number, II?

3             THE CLERK: II.

4             MR. SCAROLA: And these have been provided

5        to opposing counsel previously. They're only

6        for demonstrative purposes, and I want to go

7        through them rather quickly, if we could.

8             Keith, when you're ready, we're going to

9        start putting them up.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.I want you to strictly call our attention

12   to the portions of the advertisements that you

13   considered to be of significance, tell us why you

14   selected this as a representative example to bring

15   to the jury.

16        A.   Sure.

17        Q.   Go ahead, please.

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, may we just

19        have a moment?

20             THE COURT: Yes.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: Is it possible for you to

22        identify for us the ones you're actually going

23        to show?

24             MR. SCAROLA: May I address opposing

25        counsel? They are --4377

1              (Thereupon, a discussion was held off the

2        record, after which the following proceedings

3        were held:)

4             MR. SCAROLA: I think we straightened out

5        the problem, your Honor; and if a problem

6        arises, I'm sure we'll be able to address it.

7             So let's go.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   Before we start to look at these --

10             You can leave that up while I'm addressing

11    Dr. Cummings.

12             There did come a point in time when all

13   print advertising, in addition to all packaging of

14   cigarettes, were required to include a health

15   warning, correct?

16        A.   Yes. Packaging was 1966 and the print

17   advertising and other forms of billboards and so on

18   had to carry the warning after 1971.

19        Q.   All right. I'm not sure whether we're

20   going to show you anything that originated after

21    1971. It may be that we come across something that

22   is a post-1971 ad, but the copy that we have doesn't

23   include that warning.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=137
24             I just want the jury to know that anything

25   after 1971 had a health warning, much as I'm sure 4378

1    everybody has seen, having seen tobacco advertising

2   in print.

3             So let's go through these and these,

4   obviously, are old enough, we can tell by

5   Mr. Benny's youthful appearance, that these are old

6   enough so that there would not have been any health

7   warning on these, but just tell us why you picked

8   out these particular ads.

9        A.   It was picked out, this particular ad for

10   Lucky Strikes, very popular cigarette in the early

11    1950s, and it's reflecting the holiday theme that I

12   talked about, the Christmas theme and writing your

13   Christmas list, and this was a common promotion done

14   by many of the companies, not just American Tobacco.

15   Obviously, Mr. Benny was a well-known radio

16   celebrity and as television came on and the Jack

17   Benny Show and he was also a TV personality.

18        Q.   Next, please.

19        A.   This is another Lucky Strikes ad, again,

20   showing the link with sports back, again, in the

21    1950s, talking about the fresher, smoother taste of

22   Lucky, the toasted, which was one of their themes

23   actually beginning in the 1930s that continued to

24   give you milder cigarettes because of the way they

25   cured the tobacco with sun drying the tobacco, that 4379

1   was the toasting part.

2        Q.   Next.

3        A.   Again, on the theme for Lucky, this is

4   Buddy Young, a football player, and you saw

5   football, baseball players who were well-known, an

6   NFL player, not sure which team he played for --

7        Q.   You can tell by the helmet on the

8   ground --

9        A.   Oh, yeah. That's the Baltimore Colts.

10        Q.   Actually, I think it was Baltimore back

11    then.

12             Next.

13        A.   This is another sports celebrity. I

14   believe this is --

15        Q.   Don Newcombe?

16        A.   Don Newcombe, a pitcher of baseball.

17        Q.   Okay. Next.

18        A.   Another -- Joe Campanella, another sports

19   celebrity, so this is very common, many athletes,

20   like they do today for products were, you know,

21    hired basically to promote cigarettes, and that's

22   very appealing because it gives the appearance that

23   these people are endorsing the product and also

24   it's, you know, smoking is okay for an athlete to

25   do, and many athletes did smoke in this era.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=138
4380

1         Q.   Next.

2        A.   Another Lucky, this one, you know, be

3   happy-go-lucky, 1952 prom, so it sort of dates the

4   ad again early, talking about the special blend of

5   Lucky Strikes, the toasted tobacco, which was giving

6   you a milder smoke. "Lucky Strikes means fine

7   tobacco."

8              "L.S./M.F.T." was one of the themes in

9   their advertising which, in the early '50s, also

10   translated over into television.

11         Q.   Next.

12        A.   Again, same thing, boy meets girl. These

13   were common kinds of ads of the era. You can see

14   the sailor. Again, you saw a lot of sort of this

15   mix, because it's right after World War II, with the

16   military theme also there.

17        Q.   Next.

18        A.   Again, same theme, happy-go-lucky, nothing

19   to worry about at all, and it talks about enjoying

20   your cigarette and cigarette pleasure.

21         Q.   Next, please.

22        A.   This is a Winston ad and it talks about

23   the filtered tip cigarette and, again, similar kind

24   of theme, with young people smoking and having a

25   good time. The water theme was very common with the 4381

1   filter, sort of gives you the sense of coolness with

2   the smoke milder.

3        Q.   Next.

4        A.   This is talking about the special filter,

5   the filter blend of cigarettes for Winston. This

6   was one of their main themes. Again, you can see

7   the water in the background, "It's what's up front

8   that counts," the filter blend which, again, was the

9   theme.  "You can get the great taste of a filtered

10   cigarette, it's the taste that counts."

11         Q.   Next.

12        A.   Again, you can see how they're touting the

13   filter-blend. The filter-blend, by the way, was the

14   switchover to burley tobacco, adding more burley

15   into the blend, higher nicotine content.

16        Q.   Less manufacturing expense?

17        A.   Yes. The burley tobaccos were lower

18   because they were harsher tobacco. So in the

19   unfiltered blends that had dominated in the early

20   '50s and '40s, you couldn't sell as easily the

21   burley tobacco, that changed as the filtered blend

22   came in.

23        Q.   Next.

24        A.   Here's an early 1957 Winston. Again, the

25    "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should." That 4382

1   was part of their marketing theme that you saw in

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=139
2   printed ads, radio jingles, on television.

3             Here they're touting the special filter

4   that they have. The snowy white filter was one of

5   the other themes talking about how efficient the

6   filter was, and this was a common theme of many

7   cigarette brands, but certainly was a major theme of

8   Winston, which became the most popular filtered

9   cigarette in the '50s and '60s.

10        Q.   Next, please.

11         A.   Again, the filter blend, "it's what's up

12   front that counts," and that was a theme, again,

13    "Tastes good like a cigarette should." So you can

14   see that sort of theme being repeated again.

15        Q.   And next.

16        A.   Here, you have Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis

17   who, of course, were well-known movie personalities

18   at the time, and here, they're talking about

19   Chesterfield cigarette because of mildness, the

20   mildness theme was, again, one of those themes early

21    on that was commonly touted. This is, I believe,

22   from either late '40s or early '50s.

23        Q.   And there is a tie-in between the

24   cigarette ad and a new movie?

25        A.   That's right. 4383

1         Q.   Okay.

2        A.   And there were ties in with cigarettes at

3   that time for airlines, smoking was common on

4   airplanes, they used to give out the free packs of

5   cigarettes and many of the companies, including

6   R.J. Reynolds, they had free packs of cigarettes

7   that were given out to the people getting on the

8   airplanes back then.

9        Q.   Next, please.

10        A.   This is an early ad from the 1930s, again,

11    touting the mildness theme, which is consistently

12   talked about by many of the brands, by Camel

13   cigarettes, "they don't get your wind." Athletes

14   say, so again, using the athletes' promotion.

15             Camel was certainly a very popular brand

16   in the '20s, '30s, '40s, and into the early 1950s,

17   an unfiltered brand, so they touted the mildness.

18   Camel was the first inhalable cigarette because of

19   the new blend that they had put into Camels

20   beginning in the early 19 -- around 1915 or so.

21         Q.   And the copy says, "So mild, athletes

22   smoke as many as they please, and that's real

23   mildness."

24        A.   That's right. And they have athletes of

25   the day who were well-known. 4384

1         Q.   Next, please.

2        A.   John Wayne, obviously, a famous movie

3   star, and this is early '50s, touting not one single

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=140
4   case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels,

5   they talk about the T test for taste, you know,

6   "take the 30-day taste test for Camel." More people

7   smoke Camel than any other cigarette.

8             So the bandwagon effect was touted.

9   Again, this was common advertising for Camel in the

10   late '40s, early '50s.

11         Q.   Now, if a -- before we go to this one, go

12   back to the other one, if we could.

13             If a new smoker were attracted by this

14   advertisement to begin to smoke Camels and follow

15   the direction to smoke them for 30 days, how long

16   would it take or how many cigarettes per day would

17   it take that new smoker to cross the 100 cigarette

18   threshold?

19        A.   Well, basically, it's five packs to get to

20   a hundred cigarettes. So if they were smoking a

21   pack a day, less than a week.

22        Q.   And all they needed to smoke was less than

23   four cigarettes a day for 30 days in order to cross

24   the hundred cigarette threshold?

25        A.   Right. 4385

1         Q.   Thank you.

2             Next.

3        A.   So this is a theme, "more doctors smoke

4   Camel than any other cigarettes." This was a major

5   marketing theme. They had TV advertising for this

6   as well. This occurred in late 1940s and went into

7   the early '50s, and the claim of more doctors

8   smoking Camel than any other cigarettes.

9        Q.   Tell us how that happened.

10        A.   They did surveys. One of the surveys was

11    done at American Medical Association meeting that

12   was held in New York City at one of the major

13   hotels, they had a convention for the AMA, the

14   doctors came, and the advertising company for

15   R.J. Reynolds placed free cartons of Camel

16   cigarettes in the doctors' rooms. So when the

17   doctors arrived, the cartons were there as a gift.

18             They waited a day, and then the second day

19   of the conference, doctors would run out of their

20   usual brands, they would have Camel cigarettes, and

21    then they had people waiting as the doctors were

22   going into their meetings and say, Doctor, what

23   brand of cigarettes do you have with you today?

24   "More doctors smoke Camel than any other brand,"

25   doctors from all over the United States. 4386

1         Q.   Next, please.

2        A.   Yep, this is from 1940s, again, "Camel,

3   the extra mildness." Here, they were actually

4   promoting the idea of less nicotine in Camel

5   cigarettes, and there were a couple of other brands

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=141
6   that were using this because things in cigarettes,

7   tar and nicotine, irritation, nicotine was an

8   irritant, this is primarily why they were touting

9   less nicotine, because nicotine is actually an

10   irritant and doesn't give you taste. And so having

11    less irritation of nicotine in the product would be

12   something that would be attractive to particularly

13   people becoming smokers.

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the portion

15        of the testimony concerning why they were

16        touting less nicotine.

17             THE COURT: What?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Why they were touting

19        less nicotine.

20             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think that's what

21         the testimony was. I think the testimony was

22        why less nicotine would be attractive to the

23        smoker.

24             THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

25        A.   Extra mildness, extra coolness, extra 4387

1   flavor.

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   Next, please.

4        A.   "It's a psychological fact, pleasure helps

5   your disposition." So this was a theme about

6   teaching people about the fact that smoking makes

7   you feel better, it helps you with pleasure and

8   helps you deal with, you know, negative moods, and

9   then they have a variety of people touting that.

10   And again, this is an ad from the 1930s.

11         Q.   Next. We're going to just put a few of

12   these up quickly. These are --

13             MR. KELLY: I don't have these, Counsel.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, these were

15        provided to you yesterday, maybe the day before

16        yesterday.

17             MR. KELLY: Can I see them? This will

18        only take a moment, your Honor.

19             (Thereupon, a discussion was held off the

20        record, after which the following proceedings

21         were held:)

22     BY MR. SCAROLA:

23        Q.   All right. Just a couple of quick ones.

24        A.   Flip it around, I think.

25        Q.   I'm going to do that in a minute. I think 4388

1   I prefer to do it this way. That won't work.

2             Example of the cowboy theme used by

3   Marlboros?

4        A.   Right.

5        Q.   That took more time than it was worth.

6             Sports figures?

7        A.   Yeah. Well, they're touting the fact that

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=142
8   Marlboro is a major --or Philip Morris is a major

9   advertiser, and sports tie-in was one of the themes

10   that Marlboro used in their advertising.

11         Q.   And they were telling companies that they

12   could get their endorsement team to appear for their

13   future meetings?

14        A.   Correct.

15        Q.   Marlboro's annual football sweepstakes.

16        A.   Yes. This is an ad from 1966. It was

17   tied into the NFL championship, which I think was

18   Chicago against Green Bay. I think that's Zeke

19   Bratkowski.

20             MR. KELLY: You thought it was Bart Starr

21         last time, it's neither.

22        A.   I'm glad you looked it up.

23             Marlboro ties into the Mustang, which was

24   a very popular car in 1966. I think it had come out

25   in 1965. And they had this sweepstakes, and these 4389

1   kind of promotions were very common, and of course

2   Philip Morris' Marlboro brand was featured in the

3   advertising during that game, as a part of the

4   tie-in.

5             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, this is probably

6        a good spot for us to take our lunch break.

7             THE COURT: Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

8        we'll be in recess for lunch. I ask that you

9        be back at 1:40, so 20 minutes to 2:00, with

10        the same important instruction, not to discuss

11         the case with anyone, not to have any

12        interaction with anyone associated with the

13        case, and to avoid any media coverage should

14        you come in contact with it over the lunch

15        hour, and see you back at 1:40.

16             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

17        after which the following proceedings were

18        held:)

19             THE COURT: Okay. I'll remind our

20        witness, you remain under oath not to discuss

21         your testimony with anyone.

22             And Dr. Cummings, I will ask you to step

23        outside the courtroom. Counsel for Philip

24        Morris had a motion and requested you not be in

25        the courtroom. And then I'll have counsel for 4390

1        Philip Morris make the motion.

2             (The witness exited the courtroom.)

3             THE COURT: Okay. Dr. Cummings has

4        stepped out. What is the motion for Philip

5        Morris?

6             MR. HENK: Your Honor, it's a motion for

7        mistrial that is on multiple grounds that are

8        distinct from the motion that R.J. Reynolds

9        made earlier on behalf of both defendants.

10             I'd like to start with what is the most

11         egregious problem, and that is that

12        Dr. Cummings, in violation of numerous limine

13        orders, was asked about how many deaths have

14        been caused in the United States. And in

15        fashion that courts have become accustomed to

16        hearing, Dr. Cummings then proceeded to answer

17        outside of the question that was asked, and in

18        a terribly and irreparably prejudicial way

19        referred to deaths worldwide.

20             I don't know if plaintiffs counsel wants

21         to dispute what happened, again, as I have

22        represented it, which has happened numerous

23        times in this trial, and we've made filings

24        that showed that we were right about the

25        record. He was asked about the U.S., testified 4391

1         about deaths worldwide.

2             Well, your Honor, these defendants don't

3        sell products worldwide. Therefore, we're now

4        two steps removed. Not only could that conduct

5        not have impacted Mr. Piendle because he had

6        already passed away, which is one of the

7        primary problems with the gratuitous Pinto

8        reference that another longtime anti-tobacco

9        expert mixed into his answer.

10             We now have a witness who obviously

11         intentionally mixed in worldwide deaths when

12        not only could our conduct with respect to his

13        answer not have impacted Mr. Piendle, we didn't

14        even have any conduct with respect to at least

15        a portion of his testimony about worldwide

16        deaths, but the jury is now left with the

17        impression that they can punish us, maybe even

18        find compensatory liability, but certainly

19        punish these defendants for having caused

20        deaths worldwide, all because this witness

21         decided to offer that gratuitously.

22             I'd like to offer into the record a copy

23        of the trial testimony of Dr. Cummings on

24        cross-examination in the Finna Clay case, which

25        the Searcy, Denney law firm handled. They're 4392

1        well-aware of what Dr. Cummings does. And I've

2        flagged ten separate occasions where

3        Dr. Cummings did this sort of thing, answering

4        the question, and then preceding to mix in his

5        own prejudicial, argumentative, nonresponsive

6        testimony to prejudice these defendants.

7             Because if your Honor allows this trial to

8        proceed, you will hear on cross that this

9        expert, which is very unusual for expert

10        witnesses in any lawsuit, wants the tobacco

11         companies to go out of business. He wants the

12        U.S. government --

13             THE COURT: I'll wait until I hear

14        cross-examination. I just want to hear the

15        subject. I don't give you-all much time for

16        lunch, so I want to be able to give you some

17        time. So just state the issues for me.

18             Selling outside the United States. It's

19        your position that defendants only sell within

20        the United States. So it's a misstatement to

21         imply that the defendants sell outside the

22        United States; is that correct?

23             MR. HENK: No, your Honor, it was not a

24        misstatement. It was an intentional effort by

25        this witness to prejudice us. 4393

1              THE COURT: That's the issue, correct?

2             MR. HENK: Well, the issue is as I've

3        stated it.

4             THE COURT: Okay.

5             MR. HENK: Causing deaths outside the

6        United States, your Honor.

7             THE COURT: It's your position the

8        defendants do not sell outside the United

9        States, correct?

10             MR. HENK: Yes.

11              THE COURT: Okay. Got it. What's the

12        next issue?

13             MR. HENK: The next issue may be the most

14        blatant example of the shield/sword situation

15        certainly that I've seen in any Engle progeny

16        trial to date.

17             You will recall that Mr. Barnhart, when he

18        did not want Mr. Kelly to point out that

19        Dr. Benowitz has case-specific opinions that

20        are not helpful to the plaintiff, we weren't

21         allowed to do that.

22             THE COURT: I recall what happened

23        yesterday. What is the issue today?

24             MR. HENK: So they set up the shield.

25        Specifically, Mr. Barnhart said in front of the 4394

1        jury, "I cannot elicit an opinion of

2        Dr. Benowitz because that would be cumulative

3        of Dr. Burns."

4             So the shield is set up, rules are in

5        place, and then what do they proceed to do?

6        Intentionally, with Dr. Cummings, elicit the

7        same addiction opinions that Dr. Burns gave

8        that they themselves said in front of the jury

9        they could not do, it would be cumulative.

10             THE COURT: Okay. What is the next issue?

11              MR. HENK: The rules are not being applied

12        fairly to the defendants in this case, and

13        that's pursuant to plaintiffs request to have

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=145
14        us not be treated fairly.

15             THE COURT: What is the next issue?

16             MR. HENK: Your Honor, the plaintiffs have

17        been permitted to frame numerous questions

18        mixing in things like "If there's been a

19        suggestion that," or "If the jury has heard

20        that."

21              And what they're referring to are

22        positions they think the defendants might take

23        in this lawsuit, or an argument or a statement

24        made in opening statements by these defendants.

25        And they have been permitted to do that all 4395

1        throughout this trial.

2             Yesterday, this is another shield/sword

3        situation --

4             THE COURT: We're talking about issues

5        today.

6             MR. HENK: They're being allowed to do

7        this today.

8             THE COURT: So the issue is reframing the

9        defendants' arguments in their questioning.

10             MR. HENK: Not mixing into their questions

11         what the defendants' position is, what the jury

12        may have heard, anything like that.

13             THE COURT: Okay.

14             MR. HENK: Then, your Honor -

15             THE COURT: We're going to give you one

16        more minute to state the motion.

17             MR. HENK: Your Honor, there are two more

18        issues. The defendants have repeatedly tried

19        to have objections taken up outside the

20        presence of the jury. Most recently, we tried

21         this morning through a procedure I thought we

22        had established yesterday, through written

23        objections, and that those written objections

24        would be ruled on outside the presence of the

25        jury. 4396

1              Instead, in a desire to bring the jury

2        into the courtroom, which is not a greater

3        concern than the defendants' due process

4        rights, we proceeded to have to have the

5        objections made, albeit in writing, in the

6        jury's presence, and then have your Honor state

7        after every document that was admitted,

8        admitted over objections. In other words, so

9        the jury gets to conclude we don't want them to

10        see these documents.

11              THE COURT: If you would prefer, I can say

12        admitted, and it's stated already in your

13        written submission that there is an objection,

14        and I'll let our clerk know that it's over

15        objection so the record will reflect it clearly

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=146
16        on the documents. If that's what you prefer.

17             I'm not going to make a ruling on all of

18        these right now. I will look at each document

19        as they're being presented so I can understand

20        them. If there's a predicate that needs to be

21         laid, I will ask for one to be laid. And if

22        you would prefer for me not to say "over

23        objection, but I'm going to admit it," I'll do

24        that, and I'll just make sure our clerk knows

25        so it's marked accordingly. 4397

1              MR. HENK: As long as plaintiffs counsel

2        agrees, stipulates that when you admit a

3        particular document, that each and every

4        objection that we have made to that document in

5        the writing has been overruled, then that would

6        be appropriate.

7             THE COURT: I don't think plaintiff has

8        said anything to the contrary. Is there a

9        problem for the plaintiff?

10             MR. SCAROLA: No, your Honor.

11              THE COURT: Okay. What is the response?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Before --

13             MR. HENK: There's one more issue.

14             THE COURT: Mr. Henk, you need to be

15        mindful of a limited amount of time. The

16        breaks are not to be consumed in large part by

17        your motions. I'm trying to give you the

18        opportunity, but I want you to balance it with

19        the need of all counsel and the Court to have

20        its breaks, given these are long days.

21              So please try to conclude so that now

22        Mr. Biersteker can speak, and then I can ask

23        for a response and everybody can have their

24        lunch break.

25             MR. HENK: I will. 4398

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2             MR. HENK: The last issue is that we asked

3        for the advertising instruction to be given to

4        the jury, as the Court had approved it and read

5        it once before.

6             Plaintiffs counsel then asked for part of

7        a different instruction that had no

8        applicability whatsoever to the testimony at

9        issue, which has now led the jury to believe

10        that we can be liable for advertising. It was

11         erroneous to add that part of the instruction

12        at plaintiffs counsel's request to the jury.

13        Thank you.

14             THE COURT: Thank you.

15             Anything from R.J. Reynolds?

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

17        Company used to sell cigarettes

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=147
18        internationally. They sold their brands to

19        Japan Tobacco in, I believe, 1999 or

20        thereabouts. I do not know to what extent, if

21         any, that the company sells cigarettes abroad

22        today. If they do do so, it's minimal, but I

23        can't represent to the Court that sales are

24        being made abroad at this time.

25             THE COURT: Thank you. 4399

1              Any response then from plaintiffs to the

2        matters that have been raised?

3             MR. SCAROLA: The witness was asked about

4        deaths in the United States. The witness'

5        response, as I recall it, was "I can't give you

6        the figures for the U.S., but I know what the

7        total figures were worldwide for the past

8        century," and he gave those figures worldwide

9        for the past century.

10             There was no contemporaneous objection.

11         Had there been a contemporaneous objection and

12        a request for a limiting instruction, I would

13        suspect that we would not have objected to the

14        limiting instruction if the Court would have

15        given it. It is not a basis for a mistrial.

16             MR. KELLY: I think the record is going to

17        reflect that I moved to strike as nonresponsive

18        and that the motion was denied.

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: One further

20        amplification, your Honor. I now understand,

21        because I received an e-mail, that my client

22        does not sell cigarettes outside the United

23        States. I did not know that earlier. I have

24        been so told.

25             MR. SCAROLA: Presently. 4400

1              THE COURT: So at some point,

2        R.J. Reynolds sold outside the country?

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: Prior to approximately

4         1999.

5             MR. HENK: Just so it's clear, I believe

6        that is the same for Philip Morris. I don't

7        know the exact date. But Dr. Cummings did not

8        tailor his answer in any way.

9             MR. SCAROLA: He spoke about the last

10        century, which would have ended in 1999 or

11         2000.

12             THE COURT: Any other response from --

13             MR. SCAROLA: No other response from the

14        plaintiff.

15             THE COURT: Okay. The motion for mistrial

16        is denied.

17             The only thing that I am thinking aloud is

18        with respect to any issue relating to any

19        impression left with the jury about sales

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=148
20        outside the country, and if some clarification

21         is needed, I would entertain that from defense

22        as to an instruction that would be -- that

23        would accurately reflect the sales of the two

24        defendants in this case, in this country versus

25        outside this country. 4401

1              So I invite defense to prepare something,

2        show it to the plaintiff, and I will entertain

3        that for the purposes of considering it after

4        the break.

5             I am also giving thought and will spend

6        some time working on the cases defense gave me,

7        the Reilly case and the other case, with

8        respect to the advertising issue.

9             MR. HENK: May we approach you after the

10        break on just a couple of issues, including

11         11th Circuit ruling --

12             MR. SCAROLA: We would like an opportunity

13        for lunch.

14             THE COURT: We're going to resume with the

15        jury at 1:40, which is when I told them to come

16        back.

17             (Thereupon, a lunch recess was had at

18         12:46 p.m., after which the proceedings

19        continued in Volume XXX.) 20

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   We are going to move, Dr. Cummings, from

22   print advertising to videos and, again, you have

23   preselected these for us. So as we see them, we'll

24   show them, and after you play through them, comment

25   on the reason why you select these particular 4411

1   videos. That is, what -- what these TV

2   advertisements depict on a -- on general terms, that

3   is of significance in supporting your opinions.

4             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

5        transcribed as follows:)

6             MR. CLAMPETT: This, sir, was a dandy

7        trip. I'm a might tuckered from sleeping

8        sittin' up, but Pearl's 'ole truck run just

9        fine, and her boy drove all the way.

10             BANKER: Winston?

11              MR. CLAMPETT: No, Jethro, Jethro Bodine,

12        that's that big, tall, good looking --

13             BANKER: No, Mr. Clampett, I meant how

14        would you like a Winston cigarette?

15             MR. CLAMPETT: I don't know as I've ever

16        seen one of them before.

17             BANKER: Oh, try one.

18             MR. CLAMPETT: Uhm, mighty good smelling

19        tobacco. What's that white stuff in there?

20             BANKER: Oh, that's the Winston filter.

21         But it's what's up front that counts.

22             MR. CLAMPETT: You mean the tobacco?

23             BANKER: Oh, a cigarette is only as good

24        as the tobacco that's in it.

25             With Winston's filter blend up front, it's 4412

1        like money in the bank. You're going to like

2        Winstons.

3             MR. CLAMPETT: I reckon I'll decide that

4        for myself.

5             BANKER: Yes, sir.

6             MR. CLAMPETT: Uhm, I like it. This here

7        Winston tastes good.

8             BANKER: Like a cigarette should.

9             NARRATOR: The Beverage Hillbillies has

10        been presented by Winston. We hope you enjoyed

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^^pgNbr=153
11         it and we hope you will try Winston, because

12        Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

13             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Why did you pick that one?

16        A.   It illustrated a variety of things. One

17   is the sponsorship of a TV show, which was very

18   common. In fact, the Beverly Hillbillies was the

19   most popular, most watched sitcom. It was on

20   television back in the early 1960s. It was actually

21    cited in the 1962 annual report of R.J. Reynolds

22   Tobacco Company as being one of the ways that they

23   were successful with selling Winston cigarettes

24   through that sponsorship.

25             It also advertises the themes with the 4413

1   filter, the special white, fluffy filter and the

2   special blend, and so that was a consistent theme

3   from Reynolds for Winston cigarettes. The

4   viewership for Beverly Hillbillies was substantial

5   among under 18 at that time period, so it was not

6   just a widely viewed sitcom, but it was particularly

7   attractive to customers.

8        Q.   Next, please.

9             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

10        transcribed as follows:)

11              MR. FLINTSTONE: They sure work hard,

12        don't they, Barney?

13             MR. RUBBLE: Yeah, I hate to see them work

14        so hard.

15             MR. FLINTSTONE: Yeah, me too. Let's go

16        around back where we can't see 'em.

17             MR. RUBBLE: Gee, we ought to do

18        something, Fred.

19             MR. FLINTSTONE: Okay. How's about taking

20        a nap?

21              MR. RUBBLE: Hey, I got a better idea,

22        let's take a Winston break.

23             MR. FLINTSTONE: That's it. Winston is

24        the one filtered cigarette that delivers flavor

25        20 times a pack. Winston's got that filter 4414

1        blend.

2             MR. RUBBLE: Yeah, Fred. Filter blend

3        makes the big taste difference and only Winston

4        has it, up front where it counts. Here, ahead

5        of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich

6        tobacco specially selected and specially

7        processed for good flavor in filter smoking.

8             MR. FLINTSTONE: Yeah, Barney, Winston

9        tastes good like a cigarette should.

10             NARRATOR: The Flintstones has been

11        brought to you by Winston. America's

12        best-selling, best-tasting filtered cigarette.

13             MR. FLINTSTONE: Winston tastes good like

14        a cigarette should.

15             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   Doctor, I'm not even going to ask you any

18   questions about that one.

19             Next, please.

20             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

21         transcribed as follows:)

22             NARRATOR: Julie London sings the Marlboro

23        song.

24             MS. LONDON: Why don't you settle back and

25        have a full-flavored smoke. Settle back with a 4415

1        Marlboro. Make yourself comfortable whenever

2        you smoke, have a Marlboro cigarette. You get

3        a lot to like with a Marlboro filter flavored

4        pack or box.

5             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   You had referenced the tie-in between

8   making the product appear sexy to the youth market?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   Next, please.

11         A.   That was from the '50s, before the cowboy,

12   so they had a variety of different ads.

13             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

14        transcribed as follows:)

15             MR. GIFFORD: Hold on to your hat and come

16        on with us for the most fun we've ever had on

17        wheels, the dune buggy. By us, I mean my wife,

18        Maxine, and me, Frank Gifford, here on

19        California's giant dune. Watch our dust. Some

20        fun. I sure hope you get a chance to try it

21         sometime.

22             Here's something else you ought to try and

23        soon, Lucky Strike. Why? Because if you like

24        taste in your cigarette, you'll get it with

25        Luckys. This is all the taste a smoker could 4416

1        want, it's rich and smooth. The taste of that

2        fine tobacco. And let me tell you, once you

3        start getting that taste, you'll want to keep

4        getting it. So come on, get that fine tobacco

5        taste, get Lucky, the taste to start with, the

6        taste to stay with. Get Lucky Strike.

7             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   When Frank Gifford told the viewing

10   audience, "once you start with that taste, you're

11    going to keep wanting it," was that a truthful

12   statement?

13        A.   Well, I mean, you'd be addicted, so you

14   keep smoking, but I don't think that's what he was

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=155
15   talking about in my interpretation. Obviously,

16   using a very popular athlete at the time, he was a

17   major football star playing for the Giants, and

18   Lucky Strikes used athletes, as did the other

19   companies, to market their brands.

20        Q.   Next, please. That was the last one.

21   We're going to leave it at that.

22             Have you had occasion to review

23   advertising budgets from the early years of

24   cigarette advertising?

25        A.   Yes. 4417

1         Q.   And give us an overview, if you would,

2   please, about -- about those advertising budgets.

3        A.   Well, they were -- cigarette companies

4   were among the major advertisers in the -- of any

5   consumer product in the United States and spent

6   hundreds of millions of dollars annually to market

7   their brands, and these are cited in various reports

8   that I have reviewed where they talk about the

9   cigarette companies spending hundreds of millions of

10   dollars, again, being among the highest advertisers,

11    Monograph 19 of the National Cancer Institute

12   actually summarizes by company and by year the total

13   amount of advertising and adjusts it up into, I

14   think, 2006 dollars.

15        Q.   And that's a monograph, I think, that

16   we're going to be taking a look at in a while; is it

17   not?

18        A.   That's right. Monograph 19 is part of the

19   tobacco and cancer monograph series put out by the

20   National Cancer Institute, and Monograph 19 was on

21    the issue of marketing of tobacco products.

22        Q.   Have you gathered and reviewed statements

23   by the tobacco industry about how they viewed the

24   effectiveness of their advertising campaigns?

25        A.   Yes, we've already seen one document. The 4418

1   Diane Burrow's document is talking about the one

2   segment of the market they were very concerned with,

3   among others, but the young adult market and which

4   brands were successful, and Winston and Marlboro

5   being among the most successful brands picking up

6   that particular segment during the 1950s and '60s.

7        Q.   There has been reference made to an

8   agreement among tobacco companies to engage in a

9   coverup. Do the available documents support the

10   existence of such an agreed upon coverup?

11         A.   They do.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the

13        characterization of the findings, your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Overruled.

15     BY MR. SCAROLA:

16        Q.   When did it begin?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=156
17        A.   Well, the companies got together in the

18   late 19 -- late 1953, in December of 1953, and

19   basically continued through 1998.

20        Q.   And who were for participants?

21         A.   The participants in that 1953 were all the

22   major cigarette manufacturers, except

23   Liggett & Myers, which chose not to participate in

24   the meetings that took place in New York City at the

25   Plaza Hotel in 1953. 4419

1         Q.   Do we have the resources that enable us to

2   explore the details of this agreement and how it was

3   carried out?

4        A.   We do. I have reviewed the minutes of

5   meeting -- notes that were kept that identified the

6   individuals and companies that were represented at

7   the meetings. I've got copies of telegrams inviting

8   members of the tobacco company to come to a meeting

9   in early December. I think the first meeting was

10   held on December 14th. There was a follow-up

11    meeting on the 15th with the executives of the major

12   companies, and then a series of additional meetings

13   that occurred in December culminating in a meeting

14   to work out the details of how their public

15   relations program would be paid for by the different

16   companies, basically divided up based on their

17   market share. So if you had more market share, you

18   paid more money, and that was December 28th, 1953.

19             And then they launched their public

20   relation campaign with an agreed-upon newspaper ad

21    on January 4th, 1954, and then continued to

22   basically issue public statements, have people

23   appear on their behalf and make statements on behalf

24   of the companies during from 19 -- from that time in

25    1954 through 1998, actually. 4420

1         Q.   What is it that prompted this agreement?

2        A.   Well, there was a decline in cigarette

3   sales that occurred between 1952 and 1953, so they

4   viewed that as a crisis. This is the first time

5   that cigarette consumption had actually declined.

6             And at the time, there had been a number

7   of articles published first linking cigarette

8   smoking to lung cancer that had appeared in medical

9   journals beginning in the early 1950s, it wasn't the

10   first of those articles, in fact, there have been

11    many studies, but there was sort of a culmination of

12   many articles coming out in that time period, and

13   one of the articles that was written in 1953,

14   published in Cancer Research, got wide publicity in

15   Life Magazine.

16             There was also the introduction of

17   filtered cigarettes in response to some of the early

18   evidence, Viceroy in 1952 that was talked about in

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=157
19   Diane Burrow's document, was introduced. Kent also.

20   These were filtered cigarettes. They spent a lot of

21    money on advertising, and the companies were

22   concerned that people were worrying about cigarette

23   smoking because they viewed that -- the health scare

24   as a crisis for the companies, and they literally

25   viewed it as a crisis and got together and met in 4421

1    early December and had meetings on December 24th, on

2   Christmas Eve, and then on the 28th, right after

3   Christmas, to plan out this public relations

4   campaign which was launched in early January.

5        Q.   Before we get into the details of the

6   agreement itself and the manner in which it was

7   executed, I want to begin somewhat out of

8   chronological order with a document written in 1972

9   referred to as The Roper Proposal.

10             Would you turn to Exhibit 2050 in your

11    notebook, please. Take a look at that document and

12   tell us whether you recognize it.

13             MR. KELLY: What was that document,

14        please?

15             MR. SCAROLA: 2050.

16        A.   I do.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   And what do you recognize that to be?

19        A.   This is a memo from Fred Panzer, who was a

20   vice president at The Tobacco Institute, to the

21   president of The Tobacco Institute at the time,

22   Horace Kornegay. The date of the memo is May 1st,

23    1972, it's called The Roper Proposal, and it's

24   essentially commenting on the success of the

25   campaign, this public relations campaign that The 4422

1   Tobacco Institute had been a part of over the

2   preceding 20 years.

3        Q.   Remind us if you would, please, what The

4   Tobacco Institute was and the relationship that it

5   had to these defendants, RJR and Philip Morris.

6        A.   Well, The Tobacco Institute was a

7   organization that basically did public relations for

8   the major cigarette manufacturers. It was

9   incorporated in 1958. It grew out of another

10   organization called the Tobacco Industry Research

11    Committee that had been started and announced in

12    1954. And the communications committee of The

13   Tobacco Institute Industry Research Committee, that

14   communications group split off and became The

15   Tobacco Institute in 1958.

16             You can actually see the budgets, which

17   I've studied, that look at the amount of money that

18   had been going to TIRC was just diverted over to The

19   Tobacco Institute.

20             And they put out statements responding to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=158
21    smoking and health issues on behalf of their member

22   organizations. R.J. Reynolds was a part of that,

23   Philip Morris was, in fact, all the cigarette

24   manufacturers. And Liggett & Myers, which had not

25   participated in those meetings in December, actually 4423

1   joined The Tobacco Institute. So all the companies

2   were a part of The Tobacco Institute in 1958 when it

3   was incorporated.

4             And it was a small organization in '58,

5   and it grew to, by the early 1970s, had over 40

6   full-time employees working for them and a budget

7   well over a million dollars. In fact, it was many

8   millions of dollars. And they had their

9   spokespeople appearing on television, on radio,

10   doing press releases, putting out reports, and so

11    on.

12             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, at this time I

13        would move Exhibit 2050, based upon that

14        predicate, into evidence.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, written

16        objections.

17             THE COURT: If counsel could just approach

18        for a moment.

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: Well, one of the things I

22        noted was the discussion of the litigation

23        front, and it would seem to me that's not

24        really relevant, what they were doing on

25        strategy for the litigation front and, I 4424

1         suppose, the political front. I mean, the

2        public opinion front is really what you're

3        focusing on, isn't it?

4             MR. SCAROLA: Yes.

5             THE COURT: To be consistent with my

6        rulings, I will allow it in over objection, but

7        it would seem perhaps in redacted form.

8             I'm saying this because defense has an

9        overall objection, but to talk about litigation

10        strategy and political strategy when that's not

11         at issue seems to not be appropriate.

12             MR. SCAROLA: It was not my intent to

13        focus on those aspects of that report, and I

14        don't have any problem with a redacted version

15        being admitted into evidence.

16             Defense counsel, at the appropriate time,

17        can indicate those portions that they would

18        like redacted. I think as we go through it,

19        you will see we're not going to be focusing on

20        that part.

21              THE COURT: So only what would be shown on

22        the screen, you would need to tell the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=159
23        gentleman that portion. I don't want to see

24        the other part that's redacted.

25             MR. SCAROLA: We won't go into the 4425

1        redacted portions, into portions regarding

2        litigation.

3             THE COURT: Or political front.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: Or politics.

5             MR. SCAROLA: Or politics.

6             THE COURT: It would seem to me the public

7        opinion front. I'll overrule the objection

8        insofar as it relates to the public opinion

9        front and require the document that is admitted

10        into evidence is redacted to the satisfaction

11         of all counsel. If there's an issue, you'll

12        let me know. Otherwise, I'll assume the

13        redacted version is coming in.

14             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I wonder if this

15        would be a good time to read the limited

16        findings instruction. It sounds like we're

17        going into coverup.

18             THE COURT: I didn't hear you. Talking

19        about --

20             MR. KELLY: Coverup, concealment. So I

21         think the findings limiting instruction might

22        be appropriate at some point here. I thought

23        since we're up here, I'd mention it.

24             THE COURT: You want to see the

25        instruction? And if it's something you're 4426

1        requesting I read at this point, I'll get input

2        from all counsel.

3             So both defense think it's appropriate.

4        Any objection from plaintiff?

5             MR. SCAROLA: I really don't have an

6        objection. I am concerned that it ought not be

7        necessary to tell the jury the same thing over

8        and over again. They have been -- they have

9        been instructed in this regard, they'll be

10        instructed again at the conclusion of the case.

11              I don't know that every time we get into

12        an area as to which these instructions have

13        some applicability, that in the middle of the

14        case we need to keep repeating the instruction.

15             THE COURT: Okay.

16             MR. SCAROLA: I'm not complaining about it

17        happening right now, but it's a concern that's

18        beginning to become a mounting concern.

19             THE COURT: I've only read it once, so I

20        will read it. But at any time you can feel

21         free, just as I said to defense, when they want

22        something read, let me know why it shouldn't

23        be. I'm going to read it now. 24

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4             THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, evidence

5        has been admitted and will likely continue to

6        be admitted regarding the same subject matter

7        as the Engle findings. I instruct you that if

8        you determine that Charles Piendle is a member

9        of the Engle class, then the Engle findings are

10        deemed established and must stand on their own

11         without further explanation.

12             In addition, no witness or counsel may

13        suggest to you why the Engle jury reached its

14        findings nor mischaracterized the Engle

15        findings. The findings establish only what

16        they expressly state, and you must not guess or

17        speculate as to basis for the findings.

18             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I understand the

19        document has been admitted at this point.

20             THE COURT: Subject to the discussion.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Keith, would you put up the

22        first page of the May 1, 1972 Roper Proposal.

23        And enlarge the highlighted portion of it for

24        us. 25

4428

1              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

2        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

3        Exhibit 2050.)

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Dr. Cummings, would you read those

6   highlighted portions for us?

7        A.   Sure.  "For nearly 20 years, this industry

8   has employed a single strategy to defend itself on

9   three major fronts: litigation, politics and public

10   opinion. On the contrary, it has always been a

11    holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about

12   the health charge without actually denying it."

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Excuse me, your Honor. I

14        think this is contrary to what we just talked

15        about.

16             MR. SCAROLA: The record will reflect that

17        we're only at the first, one, two, three

18        paragraphs.

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'd like it to be taken

20        off the screen so we may approach.

21              THE COURT: Perhaps just having the

22        witness testify. If you want to show the

23        witness the document, but those portions that

24        were subject to the discussion --

25             MR. SCAROLA: I'll do it this way, 4429

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=161
1        your Honor.

2             THE COURT: -- should not come in.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   Read along with me if you would, please,

5   Dr. Cummings, to make sure I am accurately

6   publishing this portion of the document to the jury.

7             MR. SALES: It's been redacted for

8        presentation.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   That's okay.

11              It references what's been going on for a

12   20-year period, and that would bring us back to

13   approximately 1952, correct?

14        A.   Correct.

15        Q.   Okay. So this is addressing what has

16   happened from approximately 1952 to approximately

17    1972. And it says, "While the strategy was

18   brilliantly conceived and executed over the years,

19   helping us win important battles, it is only fair to

20   say that it is not, nor was it intended to be a

21    vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always

22   been a holding strategy consisting of" --

23             MR. SCAROLA: And would you put this

24        language up for us, please, so the jury is able

25        to see it, Keith, the three points that 4430

1         describe the holding strategy. Just the three

2        points describing holding strategy. Very good,

3        thank you.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   The holding strategy was "Creating doubt

6   about the health charge without actually denying it.

7              "Advocating the public's right to smoke

8   without actually urging them to take up the

9   practice.

10             "Encouraging objective scientific research

11    as the only way to resolve the question of health

12   hazard."

13             Now, can you tell us, please,

14   Dr. Cummings, whether as of 1972, there remained any

15   question about the health hazard of smoking?

16        A.   No, none.

17        Q.   Did the tobacco industry know that no real

18   question existed about the health hazards of

19   smoking?

20        A.   They did.

21         Q.   Go on if you would, please, to the

22   discussion that is contained within this document

23   about the public front.

24             Actually, let me -- let me refocus our

25   attention over here. Should we go next to the 4431

1    alternatives?

2        A.   You can go to the alternatives or just the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=162
3   third page where it talks about their public opinion

4   survey.

5        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

6             MR. SCAROLA: Page 3, Keith.

7     BY MR. SCAROLA:

8        Q.   Call our attention if you would, please,

9   to the significant portion of this page.

10        A.   Sure. It's talking about our 1970 public

11    opinion survey shows that the majority, 52 percent,

12   believe that cigarettes are only one of many causes

13   of smokers having more illnesses.

14             It also showed that half of the people who

15   believed that smokers have more illnesses than

16   nonsmokers accepted the constitutional hypothesis as

17   the explanation.

18        Q.   What was the constitutional hypothesis?

19        A.   On the prior page it says, "The

20   constitutional hypothesis, i.e., people who smoke

21    tend to differ importantly from people who do not in

22   their hereditary, in a constitutional makeup, in

23   patterns of life, and in the pressures under which

24   they live, and that accounts for why they have

25   diseases, not that they smoke." 4432

1         Q.   Was that true?

2        A.   No.

3        Q.   Read the next paragraph for us that's

4   displayed there, please.

5        A.   "Thus, there are millions of people who

6   would be receptive to a new message stating

7   cigarette smoking may not be the health hazard that

8   the antismoking people say it is because other

9   alternatives are at least as probable."

10        Q.   Was that message true?

11              MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is again the

12        same problem we had this morning. It's not

13        asking for opinions. It's really susceptible

14        to confusion.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I'll rephrase the question.

16             THE COURT: Rephrase, please.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Based upon your study of the scientific

19   literature that existed as of 1972, do you have an

20   opinion as to whether the statement "Cigarette

21    smoking may not be the health hazard that the

22   antismoking people say it is because other

23   alternatives are at least as probable" was a true

24   statement?

25        A.   In my opinion, that was a false statement. 4433

1   It was untrue.

2        Q.   To what extent did the scientific

3   community reach an agreement that there were no

4   other alternatives that were anywhere near as

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=163
5   probable as the proven link between cigarette

6   smoking and health hazards such as lung cancer?

7        A.   The scientific community had reached that

8   conclusion early on in the late 1950s, and

9   culminated with the publishing of the 1964 Surgeon

10   General's report where that evidence was reviewed in

11    detail and then presented to the American public.

12        Q.   Now, the concept of disseminating this new

13   message is referred to in this memorandum as The

14   Roper Proposal, correct?

15        A.   That's correct.

16        Q.   Let's go to the next paragraph right below

17   where we're now reading. "The proposal to

18   disseminate the message that you have just described

19   to us, the false message you have just described to

20   us called The Roper Proposal, it says, "The Roper

21    Proposal would be a persuasive, if not strictly

22   scientific medium for this message, which we have

23   done little to develop in a systematic or

24   comprehensive way."

25             And it goes on to say, "Following is my 4434

1    outline of the steps required to start a shift in

2   public opinion if The Roper Proposal is accepted and

3   there is then a scenario for action to be taken."

4             Was there an agreement to take action to

5   disseminate this false message?

6        A.   There was an agreement. That agreement

7   started in the early 1950s and continued throughout

8   the term of The Tobacco Institute, which ended in

9    1998.

10             And they, in fact, did take actions and

11    repeatedly expressed to the American public that the

12   health risks were unknown, that there were

13   alternative causes for the diseases that were

14   alleged to be related to smoking, and this message

15   was widely communicated through a massive public

16   relations campaign that was funded by R.J. Reynolds

17   and Philip Morris and the other cigarette

18   manufacturers, and they expected consumers to rely

19   on those messages.

20        Q.   Let's go if we could, please, to Exhibit

21    No. 406. See the -- I'm sorry, 3842.

22             Do you recognize this document?

23        A.   I do.

24        Q.   What is it?

25        A.   This is a telegram sent by Paul Hahn, who 4435

1   is the president of American Tobacco, to Edward

2   Darr, who is the president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco,

3   inviting him to a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in

4   December. So this is a memo that was sent on

5   December 10th. The meeting was held. Mr. Darr and

6   Mr. Hahn attended that meeting on December 14th.

7             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, at this time I

8        would move Exhibit 3842 into evidence.

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: The written objections,

10        your Honor.

11              THE COURT: 3852 is admitted.

12             MR. KELLY: 3842.

13             THE COURT: 3842.

14             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

15        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

16        Exhibit 3842.)

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Let's go ahead and read through this

19   quickly. You already told us who Mr. Darr was. And

20   what did Mr. Darr communicate to the presidents of

21    various companies including R.J. Reynolds and Philip

22   Morris?

23        A.   The memo is actually from Paul Hahn, who

24   was organizing the meeting, to Mr. Darr. And he's

25   basically saying in view of the highly publicized 4436

1    claims of certain medical men not sponsored by any

2   duly accredited scientific or medical organization

3   charging serious danger to health from smoking --

4        Q.   Let me stop you right there.

5             Was it accurate to describe those persons

6   who were making serious charges of danger to health

7   from smoking as not sponsored by any duly accredited

8   scientific medical organization?

9        A.   Not in my view, but that was the view that

10   was expressed there.

11         Q.   Continue, please.

12        A.   "I suggest for your consideration the

13   meeting of the heads of all those cigarette

14   companies that have manifested active interest in

15   scientific research, and are therefore informed as

16   to the true facts. The objective would be an

17   industry response to these charges exposing their

18   lack of scientific foundation."

19             And it goes on to talk about the method

20   would be such as a meeting might determine including

21    use of advertising media.

22             Below they indicate the companies that

23   were invited. R.J. Reynolds, Liggett & Myers,

24   Lorillard, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson,

25   Benson & Hedges, and J.B. Hudson as a representative 4437

1    of tobacco growers were invited to the meeting.

2        Q.   The invitation to the Christmas Eve

3   meeting at the Plaza Hotel?

4        A.   Well, it was held on December 14th was the

5   meeting.

6        Q.   Let's then go to Exhibit No. 710. Tell us

7   if you recognize that, please.

8             THE COURT: Which one?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=165
9             MR. SCAROLA: 710, your Honor. 710.

10             THE WITNESS: I'm not sure I'm locating it

11         here.

12             THE COURT: It's actually the second

13        document -- third document.

14             THE WITNESS: Thank you. I appreciate

15        that. Thank you very much.

16             I do recognize it.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Does that document reflect the persons who

19   actually attended that meeting on December 14, 1953?

20        A.   Yes. This is minutes from that meeting

21    that was held December 14th, 1953, at the Plaza

22   Hotel in New York City.

23        Q.   And did representatives of both Philip

24   Morris and RJR attend that meeting?

25        A.   Yes. Edward Darr from R.J. Reynolds 4438

1    attended the meeting, as well as Parker -- O. Parker

2   McComas, who was president of Philip Morris,

3   attended that meeting, as well as others.

4        Q.   How would you characterize the level of

5   executive position of the attendees at this meeting?

6        A.   These are the highest executives in the

7   company, and this is quite unusual for competitive

8   companies to get together at a meeting together to

9   talk about a joint response to -- to anything.

10        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 2135, please.

11              MR. SCAROLA: 2135, your Honor.

12        A.   2125?

13     BY MR. SCAROLA:

14        Q.   2135.

15        A.   2135. I got it.

16        Q.   Okay. Do you recognize that document?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   What is it?

19        A.   This is basically minutes from the meeting

20   that was held the day after the meeting on

21    December 14th. This was minutes prepared by Bert

22   Goss, who was an executive working for

23   Hill & Knowlton, a public relations firm.

24             And on the 14th in the meeting of the

25   executives, they agreed to hire a public relations 4439

1   firm, Hill & Knowlton. And this is the minutes from

2   the meeting where Hill & Knowlton was invited in to

3   meet with the executives on the 15th and sort of map

4   out what they were going to do for their new client,

5   the cigarette industry.

6        Q.   Now, you told us that the context in which

7   this occurred was the Surgeon General or other

8   public health sources were publishing information

9   about the dangers of cigarette smoking and the

10   science relating cigarette smoking to cancer and

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=166
11    other health hazards.

12             MR. KELLY: I'm going to object,

13        your Honor, to that summary of the evidence.

14        It's argumentative. It's mostly inaccurate.

15             THE COURT: I'll sustain.

16             Counsel, rephrase.

17     BY MR. SCAROLA:

18        Q.   Did the tobacco companies invite their top

19   scientists to attend this meeting so they could talk

20   about the science involved in responding to

21    information concerning the scientific link between

22   smoking and health hazards?

23             MR. KELLY: That calls for speculation,

24        your Honor.

25             THE COURT: I'll allow the witness to 4440

1         answer if he can.

2        A.   From the minutes of the meetings, no

3   scientists attended these meetings. These were

4   meetings attended by the executives of the companies

5   and the executives from Hill & Knowlton, the public

6   relations firm hired by the cigarette companies.

7             There are subsequent minutes where some of

8   the employees from Hill & Knowlton went and

9   interviewed the research directors for some of the

10   companies and reported their findings on the

11    research directors.

12             MR. SCAROLA: Let's look at these minutes,

13        2135, which I would move into evidence,

14        your Honor.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Subject to our written

16        objections, your Honor.

17             THE COURT: Okay. Admitted.

18             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

19        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

20        Exhibit 2135.)

21              MR. SCAROLA: Let's go, if we could,

22        please, Keith, to page 2 of these minutes, and

23        the paragraph that begins, "They feel they

24        should sponsor." 25

4441

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Read that to us, please.

3        A.   "They feel they should sponsor a public

4   relations campaign which is positive in nature and

5   is entirely pro cigarettes. They are confident that

6   they can supply us with comprehensive and

7   authoritative scientific material which completely

8   refutes the health charges."

9        Q.   Page 3, please. Beginning with "Will the

10   companies agree." Read this to us, please.

11         A.   Okay. "Will the companies agree to

12   sponsor new research which will provide definitive

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=167
13   answers to the charges? A clear-cut answer to this

14   question was deferred for the time being. The

15   companies all say they are carrying on much more

16   research in their own laboratories and are

17   sponsoring more research at hospitals and

18   universities than is generally recognized.

19              "They believe that when we are acquainted

20   with all the scientific and factual material in the

21    hands of the company, we will agree that the major

22   problem is to disseminate information on hand rather

23   than to conduct new research.

24             "However, John Hill, which is the

25   principal of Hill & Knowlton, did not agree to this 4442

1    and emphatically warned the companies that they

2   should probably expect to sponsor additional

3   research."

4        Q.   Who is Mr. Hill?

5        A.   He was one of the principals at

6   Hill & Knowlton public relations firm, which was at

7   the time one of the largest, most reputable public

8   relations firms in the country.

9        Q.   Page 4, please. The subtitle, "Other

10   information." First three paragraphs. Got it?

11    Thank you.

12        A.   "The current plans are for Hill & Knowlton

13   to serve as the operating agency of the companies,

14   hiring all the staff and disbursing all funds. The

15   chairman will probably be Mr. Hahn or the head of

16   one of the other companies resident in New York.

17   There will be a strong subcommittee of chief

18   executives, all residents in New York.

19              "Tommy Ross, counsel for American Tobacco,

20   has almost completed a white paper on the scientific

21    facts involved in the health issue, which he will

22   make available to us for our use or inclusion in

23   something we will want to distribute to all the

24   press magazines," et cetera.

25        Q.   So they were having a lawyer prepare a 4443

1    scientific white paper?

2        A.   They comment that the lawyer is working on

3   preparing this and would make it available to

4   Hill & Knowlton, and then they go on to say it was

5   arranged for Hill & Knowlton to interview the

6   scientific directors of all leading companies and

7   three interviews are being held today, respectively,

8   another will be held on Wednesday.

9        Q.   Let's go, please, to Exhibit 2061.

10             And tell us, Dr. Cummings, when you get to

11    that exhibit, whether you recognize it and what it

12   is.

13             THE COURT: Which one is it?

14             MR. SCAROLA: 2061.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=168
15        A.   Yes. This is another set of notes,

16   minutes, essentially are notes, actually, to the

17   planning committee at Hill & Knowlton. It was

18   written by Hill & Knowlton executive, Ed Dockins,

19   and it's called the Forwarding Memo, and

20   essentially, it's to the executives at

21    Hill & Knowlton telling them about the information

22   that they pulled together on their new client, the

23   cigarette companies, and how they're going to

24   utilize this information to put forward the pro

25   cigarette public relations campaign that the 4444

1    executives from the major cigarette companies had

2   agreed they wanted and were willing to support.

3             MR. SCAROLA: We would move this document

4        into evidence, your Honor.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Subject to written

6        objections, your Honor.

7             THE COURT: Admitted.

8             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

9        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

10        Exhibit 2061.)

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   Go first to page 5 of the forwarding

13   memorandum, if you would, and call our attention to

14   the significant highlighted section. Tell us what's

15   significant about this, please.

16        A.   Well, he's talking about the -- basically

17   talking about how people are responding to the

18   health message related to smoking. So he might just

19   as well go on and join his smoking -- in this

20   interim, while research pursues, the facts with full

21    assurance that if any cancer-causing agent is ever

22   really found in tobacco, the manufactures will

23   quickly find a way to eliminate it, which was, in

24   fact, a theme that was reiterated multiple times by

25   the companies. 4445

1         Q.   Page 2 of the same exhibit.

2        A.   Page 2 of this exhibit, first paragraph,

3   really talks about the interviews that were done.

4   Again, the executives from Hill & Knowlton had gone

5   out and done the interviews with the research

6   directors and they are summarizing their findings,

7   which they have contained in some folders that were

8   attached to the memo to, again, educate the others

9   at their firm what the views were.

10             They said, "The attitudes of the men we

11    must directly deal with in the industry is that

12   one's interesting and important for us to

13   understand. That is why notes on the four

14   interviews with research directors are given at some

15   length. You'll get some -- from them little real

16   information about lung cancer pro or con, but you'll

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=169
17   find some mighty interesting opinions."

18             One of the men said, quote, "It's

19   fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they

20   can't break." Said another, "Boy, wouldn't it be

21    wonderful if our company was the first to produce a

22   cancer-free cigarette, what we could do to the

23   competition."

24        Q.   Let me stop you right there, Dr. Cummings.

25   This is 1953, correct? 4446

1        A.   That's correct.

2        Q.   These are interviews being conducted with

3   the scientists that the executives directed

4   Hill & Knowlton to speak to, to prepare them to

5   conduct this advertising campaign, to rebut concerns

6   about public health and smoking?

7             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor. It's

8        argumentative.

9             MR. SCAROLA: Is that correct?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Argumentive and leading.

11              MR. SCAROLA: It is leading, I'll rephrase

12        it.

13     BY MR. SCAROLA:

14        Q.   Who were the people who were making these

15   comments?

16        A.   These were comments that were attributed

17   to the research directors of the companies that were

18   interviewed. And as you saw from the December 15th

19   meeting, that was one of the things that they said

20   they were setting up to interview those research

21    directors. And this is just the summary of their

22   findings, as summarized by Ed Dockins, who was the

23   Hill & Knowlton executive who wrote the memo.

24        Q.   And it was research directors within the

25   tobacco industry commenting in 1953 about cigarettes 4447

1   being a habit that couldn't be broken and cigarettes

2   causing cancer?

3        A.   Yeah, a habit that couldn't be broken, and

4   actually it says, "It's fortunate for us that

5   cigarettes are a habit they can't break."

6        Q.   All right, sir.

7             Page 3, please.

8        A.   This is just a summary on page 3 of sort

9   of the challenge to -- again, this is written for

10   internal folks at Hill & Knowlton, the challenge

11    that Hill & Knowlton was taking on, and it says,

12   "There is only one problem, confidence and how to

13   establish it. Public reassurance and how to create

14   it."

15        Q.   Just so the record is clear, I think you

16   may have misread it, it says, "public assurance and

17   how to create it."

18        A.   Right. "In a, perhaps, long interim when

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=170
19   scientific doubt must remain. And most important,

20   how to free millions of Americans from the guilty

21    fear that is going to arise deep in their biological

22   depths regardless of any pooh-poohing logic every

23   time they light a cigarette. No resort to mere

24   logic ever cured panic, whether on Madison Avenue,

25   Main Street, or in the psychologist's office. And 4448

1   no mere recitation of arguments pro or ignoring of

2   arguments con or careful balancing of the two

3   together is going to deal with such fear now. That,

4   gentlemen, is the nature of the unexampled challenge

5   to this office."

6        Q.   So the one problem that was identified

7   after the comments we just read in this same memo

8   was not cigarettes are addicting, correct?

9        A.   Correct.

10        Q.   It was not cigarettes cause cancer?

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, your Honor.

12        It's leading and argumentative.

13             THE COURT: Sustained.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   What was the one problem that was

16   identified in the same memo that talked about

17   addiction and cancer?

18        A.   The charge was to create public assurance,

19   to give people basically a psychological crutch and

20   self-rationale to keep smoking.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, interpreting

22        the document that was only internal at

23        Hill & Knowlton.

24             THE COURT: Sustained.

25             Ask that you rephrase. 4449

1              MR. SCAROLA: I don't need to rephrase it,

2        your Honor. Thank you.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 2290, please.

5             Tell us when you get there, Dr. Cummings,

6   whether you recognize this stuff.

7        A.   I do.

8             MR. SCAROLA: While Dr. Cummings is

9        looking at that, your Honor, may we approach

10        the bench because I may have a suggestion that

11         may expedite things.

12             THE COURT: You're welcome to come to the

13        bench.

14             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

15        held out of the presence of the jury:)

16             MR. SCAROLA: My suggestion, if I flip to

17        one of these and counsel isn't going to object

18        and I don't need to lay some predicate, I'll

19        put it up, read the sections, and move on. If

20        you want me to lay a predicate, I'm prepared to

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=171
21         do that. I want to say if that can be

22        skipped --

23             MR. KELLY: I think it's helpful to get a

24        date in.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I intend to get the date in, 4450

1         sure.

2             MR. KELLY: Get the date in and,

3        your Honor, assume we're objecting to these --

4             THE COURT: You really don't because I

5        consistent with what Mr. Henk asked, Gina is

6        getting down it's over objection.

7             MR. SCAROLA: The only objection I'm

8        asking you to waive is the establishment of the

9        predicate questions with this witness. So if

10        there isn't going to be that objection, you can

11         simply say, counsel may move on, or whatever,

12        or you can simply say, this one can go up, if

13        there's a shortcut.

14             THE COURT: That's fine with the Court.

15             MR. SCAROLA: That obviates the necessity

16        of predicate questions, put a yellow sticky.

17             MR. KELLY: It may seem like you're going

18        slowly, but you are moving quickly.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I'll keep doing it the way

20        I'm doing it.

21              MR. KELLY: I will say--1 won't say

22        anything more.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I will not

24        any longer vocalize my objection.

25             THE COURT: You don't need to because it 4451

1        has been noted.

2             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

3        concluded and the following proceedings were

4        held within the presence of the jury:)

5     BY MR. SCAROLA:

6        Q.   Are we at 2290?

7        A.   We are.

8        Q.   Do you recognize that document?

9        A.   I do.

10        Q.   Tell us what the date is, please.

11         A.   December 28, 1953.

12        Q.   And describe it very briefly for us.

13        A.   This is a meeting, again, at the Plaza

14   Hotel in New York City of the major cigarette

15   company executives, the same executives who attended

16   the meeting on the 14th, plus members of

17   Hill & Knowlton, Bert Goss and John Hill and Richard

18   Darrow of Hill & Knowlton, and they're basically

19   outlining the program of public relations that they

20   had come up with and are presenting that back to the

21    executives of the company for their approval and

22   execution.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=172
23             MR. SCAROLA: Okay. I would move 2290

24        into evidence, your Honor.

25             THE COURT: Admitted. 4452

1              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

2        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

3        Exhibit 2290.)

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Go to page 2, please, where the public

6   statement that Hill & Knowlton proposes, that is,

7   the ad agency proposes be made as described, and

8   read to us how they described what is to be done.

9        A.   Sure. Basically, under public statement,

10   it says, "It was decided that A Frank Statement of

11    the cigarette manufacturer's position on the recent

12   lung cancer publicity should be released at the

13   earliest date possible. It was agreed that only

14   through advertising could such a statement be

15   assured high visibility, full quotation, and freedom

16   from adulteration with negative information. A

17   one-time saturation program of cities, 25,000 or

18   more in population throughout the United States

19   using full page, less than one column space, was

20   determined upon a budget of $250,000 to cover all

21    space and production was allocated."

22        Q.   Again, just to be sure that this is

23   accurate, it says, "full page, less one column

24   space."

25        A.   That's right. 4453

1         Q.   Not a full page, less than one column?

2        A.   No, it was full page advertisement that

3   appeared in newspapers, so that's what it was.

4        Q.   And was that done?

5        A.   It was.

6        Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris

7   contribute their portion of the budget in order to

8   get this full saturation message out to the general

9   public?

10        A.   Yes. This memorandum talks about how that

11    would be paid for and it was agreed that the

12   companies would contribute funds to this

13   advertisement, as well as the other elements of the

14   program that were talked about in this memorandum by

15   contributing funds based on their market share.

16        Q.   All right. Let's take a look, if we

17   could, please, at that statement. Go to Exhibit

18   No. 307 and tell us if that is the full page ad that

19   the tobacco industry got together and published in

20   this saturation campaign?

21         A.   Three zero?

22        Q.   307.

23             THE COURT: It's the first one in the

24        notebook.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=173
25        A.   They're not in order. 4454

1              THE COURT: They are, actually.

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   There's a lot of zeros in front of 307.

4        A.   Got it. The Frank Statement.

5        Q.   The Frank Statement.

6             Is this the statement that was published

7   in the saturation campaign in every city of 25,000

8   population or more throughout the United States?

9        A.   Yes.

10             MR. SCAROLA: I would move it into

11         evidence, your Honor.

12             THE COURT: Admitted.

13             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

14        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

15        Exhibit 307.)

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   May we have that, please, Keith.

18             Since it's admitted and the jurors are

19   going to be able to read the whole thing, I want to

20   focus only on the bottom portion in the left-hand

21    column and read that to us, if you would, please.

22        A.   Sure. "We accept an interest in people's

23   health as a basic responsibility paramount to every

24   other consideration in our business. We believe the

25   products we make are not injurious to health. We 4455

1    always have and always will cooperate closely with

2   those whose task it is to safeguard the public

3   health."

4        Q.   Now, let's take a look at those

5   statements, if we could, please. Do you have an

6   opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, within

7   your area of expertise, as to whether up to

8   January 4, 1954, the tobacco industry was placing

9   people's health above every other consideration in

10   their business?

11              MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor,

12        overbroad.

13             THE COURT: Rephrase.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   In the period of time between, let's say,

16    1950 and 1954, was the tobacco industry placing

17   people's health as a basic responsibility above

18   every other consideration in their business?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   After January of 1954, from 1954 to 1960,

21    did the tobacco industry place people's health above

22   every other consideration in their business?

23        A.   No, they did not.

24        Q.   Did they do it in the'60s?

25        A.   No. 4456

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=174
1         Q.   Did they do it in the 70s?

2        A.   No.

3        Q.   Did they do it in the'80s?

4        A.   No.

5        Q.   Did they do it in the'90s?

6        A.   No.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, your Honor.

8        No connection to Mr. Piendle whatsoever after

9         1989.

10             MR. SCAROLA: Reprehensibility,

11         your Honor.

12             THE COURT: Okay. I'll overrule the

13        objection.

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Are they doing it today?

16             MR. KELLY: Same objection, your Honor.

17             THE COURT: Overruled.

18        A.   They're not putting the public's health

19   above all other considerations of their business

20   even today.

21      BY MR. SCAROLA:

22        Q.   Their second Frank Statement:  "We believe

23   the products we make are not injurious to health."

24   Based upon your review of the tobacco industry's own

25   internal documents as they existed prior to 1954, 4457

1    did the tobacco industry believe that they were

2   making a product that was not injurious to health or

3   did they know that the product they were making was,

4   in fact, very injurious to people's health?

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection. It's leading

6        and argumentative.

7             THE COURT: Rephrase.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   I'll rephrase the question. What did the

10   tobacco industry know about whether their product

11    was or was not injurious to people's health as of

12   the time that they were publishing this statement to

13   everyone in the United States residing in a city

14   with a population of 25,000 or more?

15        A.   They knew that the scientific literature

16   that had been reviewed up to that point had

17   indicated that at least among heavy-smoking males,

18   they had a higher propensity to develop lung cancer,

19   they knew that there were likely carcinogens in the

20   product, and they had summarized the accumulated

21    evidence from animal studies that showed, although

22   mixed in their findings, generally found that the

23   condensator tar, when applied to the skin of a mouse

24   or another animal, would develop tumors, and that

25   was before this ad was published. 4458

1         Q.   We're going to break down the last

2   statement into two parts.  "We always have

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=175
3   cooperated closely with those whose public task it

4   is to safeguard the public health."

5             Do you have an opinion, to a reasonable

6   degree of certainty within your area of expertise,

7   based specifically upon your review of the internal

8   documents of the tobacco industry and your knowledge

9   of what was going on within the public health

10   community up to January of 1954, do you have an

11    opinion as to whether that statement is true or

12   false?

13        A.   I do.

14        Q.   What is that opinion?

15        A.   Up to 1954,1 would say they really didn't

16   communicate much to people in the medical community

17   either way. So they really weren't cooperating or

18   not cooperating, in my opinion, up to 1954.

19        Q.   From 1954 through 1960, when they said

20   that they always will cooperate closely with those

21    whose task it is to safeguard the public health, did

22   they fulfill that promise to the public?

23        A.   My opinion, they did not. In fact, they

24   countered that opinion over time, becoming less and

25   less cooperative with the public health and public 4459

1   health officials and scientist who were doing

2   research on the relationship between smoking and

3   health.

4        Q.   Did that lack of cooperation and

5   opposition to public health officials continue

6   through the'60s?

7        A.   I think it became less cooperative through

8   the 1960s, particularly after the '64 report, and

9   became less and less and less cooperative throughout

10   the subsequent decades.

11         Q.   Including the '70s, the '80s, and into the

12   '90s?

13             MR. KELLY: Objection, your Honor,

14        Williams/State Farm. There's no nexus

15        whatsoever to Mr. Piendle.

16             THE COURT: Response.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Reprehensibility.

18             THE COURT: Overruled.

19        A.   Yes, through that period, in particular in

20   the '70s and '80s and '90s, there was attacks on the

21    Surgeon General's reports and actually efforts to

22   counter them, as well as talking about refuting the

23   findings from scientific -- people doing science on

24   smoking, as described in the Roper Proposal. That

25   was one of the strategies that they talked about. 4460

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   All right. This public pledge is made in

3   January of 1954. Let's go just four months later,

4   April 1954, Exhibit 2900. Tell us whether you

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=176
5   recognize 2900.

6        A.   I do.

7        Q.   What is it?

8        A.   This is the white paper that was issued by

9   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, largely an

10   organization run by Hill & Knowlton, the public

11    relations firm that had been hired. And it's

12   basically talking about evidence refuting the charge

13   that smoking caused disease. It was discussed in

14   the memo in December 28th of 1953, as to whether

15   they would release that, they said they would hold

16   it. This was released about six months later and

17   was distributed widely to, you know, magazine

18   editors, newspaper editors, public officials, and

19   anybody who wrote to get information about smoking

20   and health and, essentially, summarized the

21    industry's position that there was a controversy,

22   and they titled their report, A Scientific

23   Perspective on the Cigarette Controversy, again, a

24   theme that was carried through for decades.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I would move Exhibit 2900 4461

1        into evidence, your Honor.

2             THE COURT: Admitted.

3             MR. SCAROLA: I apologize, I didn't hear

4        you.

5             THE COURT: It was admitted.

6             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

7        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

8        Exhibit 2900.)

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   As you told us, the title of this document

11    is A Scientific Perspective on the Cigarette

12   Controversy. Was there, in April of 1954, just four

13   months after the Frank Statement pledge that we just

14   reviewed, any real controversy in the scientific

15   community with regard to the health hazards of the

16   cigarettes?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, your Honor,

18        cumulative of everything we went through with

19        Dr. Burns previously.

20             THE COURT: Response.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Entirely different

22        perspective of expertise, and it is based upon

23        a review of different documents.

24             THE COURT: Okay. Well, I'll overrule the

25        objection, but just request that the testimony 4462

1         on areas that overlap, albeit different

2        perspective from a different witness be

3        limited.

4             MR. SCAROLA: It's going to be extremely

5        brief.

6        A.   The relevance of this document is it

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=177
7   basically summarizes opinions from people who

8   question the relationship between smoking and

9   disease, and it was published by the Tobacco

10   Industry Research Committee and it also pledged to

11    create a research organization to study the alleged

12   relationship between smoking and disease. And this

13   document was put out six months after they announced

14   their formation, and there had been no research

15   funded at that point, so this was a compilation of

16   the material that had been collected by

17   Hill & Knowlton, discussed in that memo that

18   American Tobacco, their lawyer, Tommy Ross, had

19   accumulated their white paper. So this was

20   essentially the white paper, and it was distributed

21    for public relations purposes. It was not new

22   research, it was just a compilation of statements

23   about smoking and health and it did reflect a

24   controversy. 25

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Without going through the details of this

3   document, it makes reference in the very beginning,

4   in the introductory pages to the existence, quote,

5   of no proof establishing that cigarette smoking is a

6   cause of lung cancer, unquote.

7             Was that an accurate reflection of the

8   state of the science with regard to cigarettes and

9   lung cancer as of that time?

10             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, may we approach,

11        please?

12             THE COURT: Yes.

13             MR. SCAROLA: I'll rephrase the question,

14        your Honor.

15     BY MR. SCAROLA:

16        Q.   Do you have an opinion, to a reasonable

17   degree of scientific certainty within your area of

18   expertise, as to whether the suggestion that there

19   was no proof establishing that cigarette smoking is

20   a cause of lung cancer was accurate?

21         A.   I do have an opinion.

22        Q.   What is that?

23        A.   That was inaccurate.

24        Q.   Let's go, if we could, please, we're going

25   to be going to Exhibit 1689A, which is a video 4464

1    exhibit. Tell us, if you would, please, who

2   Timothy V. Hartnett was in 1955.

3        A.   Sure. Timothy Hartnett, in 1955, was the

4   president of the Tobacco Industry Research

5   Committee. He had previously been the president of

6   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company and had signed

7   the Frank Statement as president of

8   Brown & Williamson, all the organizations had signed

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=178
9   the statement, and you will see his signature there

10   or his name there.

11              But he had taken on the role as chairman

12   of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in July

13   of 1954 and he appeared on the Edward R. Murrow

14   television show, as did a number of other people in

15    1955, and we have a video clip of his appearance on

16   that show on behalf of the cigarette manufacturers

17   and their organization that they funded, the Tobacco

18   Industry Research Committee.

19        Q.   All right. Now, there are very few of us

20   in this courtroom who are old enough to remember the

21    Edward R. Murrow Show, but what was the degree of

22   popularity of that particular program in 1955? Was

23   it a widely-viewed television program?

24        A.   Yes, it was widely viewed. It was sort of

25   a 60 Minutes show of that era. And keep in mind 4465

1   back in 1955, there were three major television

2   networks, not 150 cable news networks that we sort

3   of have today. So more people watched the major

4   news networks, and his show was among the most

5   popular shows on television at that time.

6             MR. SCAROLA: We move this video into

7        evidence at this time.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: I can't remember if this

9        was included, I'd like to make sure it's

10        complete, not just one excerpt.

11              MR. SCAROLA: We're not planning on

12        showing the whole show.

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: I wasn't suggesting you

14        had to show the whole show. Obviously, if it

15        couldn't be admitted into evidence, the whole

16        portion of the show dealing with this topic

17        ought to be used as an exhibit, not just the

18        snippet.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I have no objection to as

20        much of the Edward R. Murrow Show as the

21         defense chooses to put in. For our purposes,

22        because we're trying to focus as quickly as we

23        can on matters which, from the plaintiffs

24        perspective are significant, we would introduce

25        this portion now and invite the defense to put 4466

1         on any other portion of the Edward R. Murrow

2        Show any time, any day that they would like to.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: If it's going to be

4        admitted into evidence, it ought to be

5        complete, as counsel full well knows.

6             THE COURT: I will admit the entire video

7        as 1689A subject to the noted objections, but

8        permit counsel to only show that portion that

9        you want to show right now.

10             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=179
11         marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

12        Exhibit 1689A.)

13             MR. SCAROLA: Please play it.

14             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

15        transcribed as follows:)

16             NARRATOR: This is Timothy V. Hartnett,

17        former president of a major tobacco firm, and

18        chairman of the industry research committee.

19             MR. HARTNETT: Mr. Murrow, I would like to

20        quote from a statement released at the time the

21         Tobacco Research Committee was formed. At that

22        time we stated, "We accept an interest in

23        people's health as a basic responsibility

24        paramount to every other consideration in our

25        business." And that's where we stand today. 4467

1              (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

3        Q.   Mr. Clarence Cook Little also appeared on

4   the Edward R. Murrow show in 1955. Tell us who

5   Clarence Cook Little was.

6        A.   At the time he appeared on the Edward R.

7   Murrow show, he was the chairman of the scientific

8   advisory board that had been created. This was the

9   research organization that was announced in the

10   Frank Statement, and they said they would fund

11    research and would have an esteemed body of

12   scientists who would oversee that research. And he

13   was appointed as the chairman in, I believe, July of

14    1954.

15             And he also appeared on the Edward R.

16   Murrow show, actually a different segment, there

17   were two segments that were run of that particular

18   show, and they had scientists from both sides

19   appearing on the show.

20             MR. SCAROLA: We would move this video

21         clip into evidence, your Honor, with the same

22        understanding, that the defense is welcome to

23        introduce any other portion of this or any

24        other Edward R. Murrow show that they consider

25        to be relevant. 4468

1              THE COURT: Which exhibit number is this?

2             MR. SCAROLA:  1686B.

3             THE WITNRESS: I think we have an audio.

4             MR. SCAROLA: This is just audio.

5             THE COURT: But this is Exhibit 1686?

6             MR. SCAROLA:  1686B, and what we have here

7        is an audio clip.

8             THE COURT: I've already admitted 1689A in

9        its entirety, so presumably that covers it.

10             MR. SCAROLA: We're just not sure whether

11         it's the same show or whether -- there was a

12        series that focused on these issues, and it may

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=180
13        have been a different night, but they can put

14        in any night of any Edward R. Murrow program

15        they would like to, no objection.

16             THE COURT: So 1686B admitted with noted

17        findings objections.

18             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

19        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

20        Exhibit 1686B.)

21         A.   This is just the audio clip. He did

22   appear on the show. That's Clarence Cook Little,

23   the former president of the University of Michigan,

24   and he was also the head of the Jackson Labs, which

25   was a big laboratory doing genetic animal research 4469

1    at the time, and he was chairman of the scientific

2   advisory board.

3             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

4        transcribed as follows:)

5             THE HOST: Suppose the tremendous amount

6        of research now going on, including that of the

7        Tobacco Industry Research Committee were to

8        reveal that there is a cancer-causing agent in

9        cigarettes, what then?"

10             MR. LITTLE: Well, if it was found by

11         somebody working under the Tobacco Industry

12        Research grant, it would be made public

13        immediately, and just as broadly as we could

14        make it. And then our thoughts would be taken

15        to attempt to remove that substance or

16        substances.

17             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   Do you have an opinion to a reasonable

20   degree of scientific certainty within your area of

21    expertise, based upon all of the documents that you

22   have reviewed, including specifically the internal

23   documents of the tobacco industry, whether that

24   pledge to the American public was kept?

25        A.   That pledge was not kept, but it was 4470

1   repeated many, many times by many, many different

2   spokespeople over several decades.

3        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 1608, please.

4             And when you've turned to that,

5   Dr. Cummings, tell us whether you recognize that

6   letter of July 30, 1957, on the stationery of

7   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

8             MR. KELLY: Number again, please?

9             MR. SCAROLA:  1608.

10             THE COURT: Is that in the notebook?

11              MR. SCAROLA: Pardon me?

12             THE COURT: Is that in the notebook?

13             MR. KELLY: I go from 1533 to 1817.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I apologize, it is not

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=181
15        included. But let me show it to opposing

16        counsel. And let me show it to your Honor.

17             MR. KELLY: I got it.

18             MR. SCAROLA: May I proceed, your Honor?

19             THE COURT: Yes.

20        A.   I have a copy of it as well.

21      BY MR. SCAROLA:

22        Q.   Do you recognize that?

23        A.   Yes, I do.

24        Q.   What do you recognize it to be?

25        A.   This is a letter that's written by Edward 4471

1   Darr, President of R.J. Reynolds, to Paul Hahn on

2   July 20 -- or July 30, 1957. And he is basically

3   talking about the success of the Tobacco Industry

4   Research Committee's public relations effort, and

5   then talking about the need to spin off a new

6   organization to do more public relations activity

7   for the companies, and that organization was The

8   Tobacco Institute, which was incorporated in 1958.

9             MR. SCAROLA: I would move that document

10        into evidence, your Honor.

11              THE COURT: Admitted.

12             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

13        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

14        Exhibit 1608.)

15             MR. SCAROLA: May we have that up.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   And call our attention to those matters

18   which you consider to be of significance and rely

19   upon in the formation of your opinions.

20        A.   Yes. It's a two-page letter, and he, in

21    the first two paragraphs, is talking to Mr. Hahn,

22   who had originally called the meeting of the

23   executives to get together at the Plaza Hotel.

24             And he said, "You took a bold and

25   courageous action in December 1953 when you called 4472

1   for a meeting of manufacturers and other industry

2   groups to discuss ways and means of presenting a

3   united front against the claims that were being made

4   that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. The

5   formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

6   was the result. There is absolutely no question in

7   my mind that if this committee had not been formed,

8   the cigarette industry by now would have been in a

9   deplorable position. Instead, a very fine job has

10   been done in counteracting unverified, unjustified,

11    and unsubstantiated claims of the anti-cigarette

12   fanatics. In other words, the Tobacco Industry

13   Research Committee has been a successful defensive

14   operation."

15        Q.   Continue, please.

16        A.   You want me to read the whole letter?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=182
17        Q.   No, I want you to read the part we --

18        A.   This is the bottom of the first page, and

19   then going on to the top of the next page.

20             "I am convinced that an organization of

21    tobacco manufacturers formed for the narrow and

22   well-defined specific purpose of presenting facts

23   and information helpful to the industry can and

24   should be formed, and that such an organization be

25   entirely separate from the TIRC, which would 4473

1    continue its activities in connection with the

2   scientific advisory board grants, but would

3   discontinue the major part of the public relations

4   activity, leaving this to be handled by the new

5   organization, whatever that name might be given to

6   it."

7        Q.   Was that organization formed?

8        A.   It was in 1958. It was called The Tobacco

9   Institute.

10        Q.   All right, sir. Let's move, please, to

11    Exhibit 3613. Look at that, tell us whether you

12   recognize it.

13        A.   3615?

14        Q.   3615. Pardon me. Thank you.

15             That's the one that's got a -- it's

16   actually not a printed tab, it's a handwritten tab.

17        A.   Oh, thank you. I got it.

18        Q.   Okay. Yeah. Switching gears again for

19   just a moment, go to 3588 first.

20        A.   Okay. Got that one.

21         Q.   Good.

22             THE COURT: Which one?

23             MR. SCAROLA: 3588, your Honor. Report on

24        visit to the U.S.A. and Canada, 17 April 1958,

25        through 12th of May. 4474

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, may we

2        approach on this one?

3             THE COURT: Yes.

4             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

5        held out of the presence of the jury:)

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, this is an

7        exhibit that you previously excluded in

8        connection with Dr. Burns' testimony as

9        containing hearsay within hearsay. I don't

10        know for what purpose it is being offered now,

11        but I suspect it's the same one.

12             MR. KELLY: We had this with Dr. Burns,

13        correct?

14             THE COURT: 3588 was not admitted. I

15        sustained the objection.

16             MR. SALES: I said we could lay a better

17        predicate.

18             THE COURT: No, I think it was hearsay.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=183
19        So I'm going to be consistent with that ruling.

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

21              MR. SCAROLA: That's fine.

22             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

23        concluded and the following proceedings were

24        held within the presence of the jury:) 25

4475

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   We are going to skip over 3588 right now,

3   and we are going to move from 3588 to 2141.

4        A.   Okay. Got it.

5        Q.   Do you recognize that document?

6        A.   I do.

7        Q.   What do you recognize that to be?

8        A.   This is a memo written by Alan Rodgman,

9   who is senior chemist at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

10   Company, to a Mr. Kenneth Hoover, who was a director

11    of research at R.J. Reynolds at the time this was

12   written, November 2nd, 1959.

13             And he's talking about basically a

14   extraction procedure that they had been working on

15   to try and remove some of the constituents in

16   tobacco, and also the importance of adding back

17   certain elements into the product.

18             MR. SCAROLA: We would move the

19        November 2, 1959 memorandum into evidence,

20        your Honor.

21              THE COURT: Admitted.

22             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

23        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

24        Exhibit 2141.)

25             MR. SCAROLA: Could you put that up, 4476

1        Keith? And specifically we want to go to

2        page 4 of this document. You got it.

3     BY MR. SCAROLA:

4        Q.   What does this document reflect with

5   regard to the knowledge of the addictive properties

6   of nicotine?

7        A.   Well, it points out that -- because they

8   were talking about this extraction process to remove

9   a certain class of chemicals, poly cyclic aromatic

10   hydrocarbons, of which they identified many and talk

11    about that in this document.

12             And through the extraction procedure they

13   were using, they noted that the physiological

14   requirements of the smoker with respect to nicotine

15   can be met by the application of the optimum amount

16   of nicotine to the extracted tobacco. So they need

17   to put back the nicotine they've extracted out that

18   comes out with the attempt to try to remove some of

19   the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and it

20   recognizes the importance of maintaining nicotine in

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=184
21    the product for what they refer to as smoker

22   satisfaction.

23        Q.   You told us earlier that patents existed

24   dating back to the '20s that confirm the existence

25   of technology to be able to remove nicotine from 4477

1   tobacco, and that the companies were actually doing

2   that, and you talked about spraying the nicotine

3   back onto the tobacco product.

4        A.   Through the -- yes, they did. I mean,

5   there are two separate things. There were patents

6   that I mentioned, and there are many patents that

7   had been issued certainly by the 1950s that talked

8   about various extraction procedures, and some of

9   those patents were explicitly talking about removing

10   nicotine from tobacco and the reconstitution

11   process, which was begun during this period, using

12   reconstituted tobacco, where they would use the

13   stems and the stalks and grind it up, and then

14   extract the nicotine, the color. They glued the

15   material together, and then they would spray to get

16   the uniform delivery of nicotine so they could be a

17   little bit more precise in their nicotine delivery

18   in the cigarette. So it was a way of controlling,

19   better controlling the product.

20        Q.   If no nicotine were added back into that

21    reconstituted tobacco, would the product be

22   addicting?

23        A.   It might be.

24             MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. I need to object.

25        Uncertain what the product would be --4478

1              MR. SCAROLA: Cigarettes.

2             MR. KELLY: -- whether reconstituted

3        tobacco or a blend.

4             THE COURT: Clarify.

5     BY MR. SCAROLA:

6        Q.   Would cigarettes comprised of

7   reconstituted tobacco from which all nicotine had

8   been removed be addicting?

9        A.   No.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Same objection.

11              THE COURT: Overruled.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   Would cigarettes comprised of

14   reconstituted tobacco to which less nicotine was

15   added be less addicting?

16        A.   Probably not. It depends on the minimum

17   amount needed because smokers will compensate when

18   they smoke a cigarette that delivers less nicotine

19   by a variety of behavioral means, bigger puffs,

20   deeper puffs, more frequent puffs. If that doesn't

21    do it, they'll smoke more cigarettes.

22             So there are a variety of ways that people

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=185
23   smoke to get their daily supply of nicotine, which

24   is why low-nicotine products really don't lower the

25   exposures that people get because they'll just 4479

1    compensate even subconsciously, not consciously

2   knowing that they're taking a deeper puff or smoking

3   extra puffs on the cigarette because they're just

4   smoking to get their daily supply of nicotine. But

5   if it had no nicotine or very little nicotine, they

6   probably would stop smoking.

7             MR. SCAROLA: Would you please go, Keith,

8        to page 3, the discussion section, Roman

9        numeral III.

10     BY MR. SCAROLA:

11         Q.   And Dr. Cummings, tell us what the

12   significance is of this portion of the document as

13   you have relied upon it.

14        A.   Right. This is the discussion of this

15   memo, from Dr. Rodgman, the chemist, to Kenneth

16   Hoover, who is the director of research, and he's

17   talking about "the choice of the most optimum

18   approach needs to consider the following." And this

19   is in terms of the composition of cigarette smoke.

20             "In any discussion of smoke and its

21    relation to health and smoking enjoyment, the

22   question arises, what is the optimum composition of

23   the cigarette smoke with respect to these factors?

24             "This question may best be answered as

25   follows: Cigarette smoke should contain as little 4480

1    as possible, preferably at a zero level, of

2   polycyclic hydrocarbons, it should possess

3   satisfactory flavor to please the consumer, and it

4   should contain sufficient nicotine to supply the

5   necessary requirements of the smoker with respect to

6   this compound."

7             The asterisk highlighted at the bottom

8   says, "We consider the zero level for extracting or

9   removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to be

10   impossible to achieve as long as the combustion

11    temperature of the cigarette is greater than

12   700 degrees Centigrade."

13        Q.   Why did you consider that to be of

14   significance?

15        A.   Because it reflected the fact that they

16   were not going to be able to remove that class of

17   harmful chemical because when you burn cigarettes

18   and you puff them and the cone gets hot, it's

19   burning well over 700 degrees Centigrade.

20        Q.   Harmful meaning the cancer-causing?

21         A.   It produces the polycyclic aromatic

22   hydrocarbons, which are and were viewed at that

23   time, in 1959, as carcinogens in cigarettes.

24        Q.   All right, sir. Exhibit 3615.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=186
25            THE COURT: Let me know when it's a good

4481

1        breaking point.

2             MR. SCAROLA: It is convenient whenever it

3        is convenient to your Honor.

4             THE COURT: Can I have counsel approach

5        first before we break.

6             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

7        held out of the presence of the jury:)

8             THE COURT: I want to make sure that

9        plaintiffs counsel is finished today with this

10        witness. Do I need to let the jury know right

11         now, over the break, that they need to plan on

12        staying later for purposes of making phone

13        calls?

14             MR. SCAROLA: For purposes of my

15        finishing, no.

16             THE COURT: If we come back at 3:35,

17        you're going to finish by 5:00.

18             Well, I'm going to let them go on break

19        now.

20             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

21         concluded and the following proceedings were

22        held within the presence of the jury:)

23             THE COURT: Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

24        we're going to take our mid-afternoon break.

25        We are going to be in recess until 25 minutes 4482

1        to 4:00.

2             Please remember the important instruction

3        not to discuss the case, not to have any

4        interaction with anyone associated with the

5        case. Leave your notepads on your chair.

6        We'll see you back at 25 minutes to 4:00.

7             And remind our witness that you remain

8        under oath and you're not to discuss your

9        testimony with anyone on the break.

10             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

11         after which the following proceedings were

12        held:)

13             THE COURT: Okay. Counsel didn't move

14        710. Was that just supposed to be for I.D.

15        only?

16             MR. SCAROLA: The Frank Statement? I

17        think that's the Frank Statement. And it was

18        certainly my intention to move that into

19        evidence, and I thought that I had.

20             THE COURT: No, 710 is the memorandum,

21         it's not the Frank Statement.

22             MR. BRETT: 710 was the meeting minutes,

23        the 1953 meeting minutes.

24             MR. SCAROLA: The only thing I used that

25        for was to identify the participants, and that 4483

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=187
1        really doesn't need to go into evidence.

2             THE COURT: Okay. What was the question

3        from defense?

4             MR. KELLY: I think Mr. Biersteker had a

5        question.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I think we worked it out.

7             THE COURT: So what we were discussing is

8        that we were going to finish with direct today

9        by 5:00. So -- and I guess if we finish before

10        5:00, we'll start cross. Otherwise, we'll

11         start cross in the morning.

12             MR. KELLY: Okay. We're not going to go

13        past 5:00 on the cross, are we, your Honor?

14        It's awfully late.

15             THE COURT: No. We were going to go past

16        5:00 on direct if need be, but it wasn't

17        represented we needed to, so I didn't say

18        anything to the jury.

19             MR. KELLY: I do have some objections to

20        videos that may be shown over the balance of

21         the day, and it might be appropriate for you to

22        take a look at them before the jury does.

23             THE COURT: Do you want to take that up

24        now?

25             MR. KELLY: Do you want to take a little 4484

1        break and then we can do it?

2             THE COURT: We can. I don't know how many

3        videos or how long that will be. Do you want

4        to come back in five minutes or 

5             MR. KELLY: Maybe a little longer than

6        five minutes?

7             THE COURT: Well, I have them coming back

8        at 25 of.

9             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

10        3:21 p.m. until 3:30 p.m., after which the

11         following proceedings were held:)

12             THE COURT: Let's try to take a peek at

13        some of those videos. Are they TV shows, like

14        news clips?

15             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, I'll give you a little

16        intro for each one.

17             THE COURT: Okay.

18             MR. KELLY:  1681 is a clip from 1971 Face

19        the Nation program.

20             THE COURT: Okay.

21              MR. SCAROLA: It's a very short clip of

22        the C.E.O., I believe, or president of Philip

23        Morris, who is being interviewed by three of

24        the news people, and it's a very clipped

25        portion. So I'd object that it's out of 4485

1         context under 403.

2             And there's one portion of the clip that

3        deals with the chairman being asked about a

4        report on -- out of England on the effect of

5        smoking while pregnant and the consequences for

6        the birthweight of the infants, and he makes a

7        comment that is generously described as

8        chauvinistic, if not more critically described.

9             THE COURT: Okay.

10             MR. KELLY: We don't have any pregnant

11        plaintiff. We have, I think, some mothers on

12        the jury who are going to be aghast at that

13        statement.

14             THE COURT: Can I see it?

15             MR. KELLY: Sure.

16             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

17        transcribed as follows:)

18             MR. COHEN: We do talk to the question of

19        whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. We do

20        not believe that cigarettes are hazardous. We

21         don't accept that. When, as, and if any

22        ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as

23        being injurious to human health, we are

24        confident that we can eliminate that

25        ingredient. 4486

1              THE HOST: Do you believe that cigarettes

2        are safe? Have they proven to be safe,

3        Mr. Cohen?

4             MR. COHEN: I believe they have not been

5        proven to be unsafe, and I conclude from that

6        report that it's true that babies born from

7        women who smoke are smaller, but they're just

8        as healthy as the babies born from women who do

9        not smoke.

10             THE HOST: What about the higher rate of

11         deaths?

12             MR. COHEN: Some women prefer having

13        smaller babies.

14             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

15             THE COURT: Okay.

16             MR. KELLY: That's all clipped together,

17        it's a 20-minute program, so those are all

18        edited clips. And that's all we object on the

19        grounds that I stated, in addition to those

20        that are set forth in the written submission.

21         But that could easily be edited out, that last

22        portion.

23             MR. BARNHART: That's critical.

24             THE COURT: Response.

25             MR. SCAROLA: That's critical. 4487

1              THE COURT: That's undoubtedly critical.

2             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, I couldn't

3        resist.

4             MR. BARNHART: Nor could I. Mr. Scarola

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=189
5        is more than capable of arguing that.

6             MR. KELLY: That must mean it's really

7        prejudicial, not to mention irrelevant.

8             MR. SCAROLA: This is the chairman of the

9        board at Philip Morris. This is after the

10        Frank Statement where the pledge has been made

11         that if there is anything injurious in any way

12        to the health of the general public, that we

13        are going to candidly acknowledge that, and if

14        there are any problems with this product, we

15        are going to eliminate them. And in the face

16        of scientific evidence of dangers, they're

17        breaking the promise and clearly it is part of

18        the established pattern to carry out this

19        agreement to disclaim health risks, rather than

20        to cooperate with --

21              THE COURT: Okay.

22             MR. SCAROLA: -- public health officials.

23             THE COURT: I'm going to allow, but not

24        the last statement about the babies, that's

25        going to come out. 4488

1              MR. KELLY: The next one, your Honor, is

2         1683 --

3             THE COURT: Which one --1 guess you'll go

4        over the numbers when you introduce them.

5        Okay, what is the next one?

6             MR. KELLY:  1683, this is a clip of one

7        that the Tobacco Institute spokespeople, Anne

8        Browder, being interviewed on 20/20 by

9        Mr. Stossel, and it's a lengthy interview, it

10        covers a lot of issues, but this is a clip that

11         has been edited out, maybe you can see it.

12        I'll see it again to refresh my memory. It's a

13        couple of selections, but my memory is that one

14        of those concerning -- she's a Tobacco

15        Institute employee. She's asked questions

16        about the use of product placement in the

17        Superman movie by Marlboro. She's not speaking

18        on behalf of Philip Morris about product

19        placement in the Superman movie.

20             If we get into that issue, your Honor,

21         I'll represent to the Court that the

22        documentation I'm aware of is that a Philip

23        Morris international company may have paid for

24        product placement, according to the

25        documentation. That company is not the 4489

1         defendant in this case. I don't know enough

2        about the logistics of the production company

3        who produced that Superman movie and whether it

4        was European or not to know why that happened,

5        but it is not this defendant in the case.

7        talking on our behalf for the specifics of the

8        Marlboro placement, and you'll see some of the

9        statements she made certainly aren't

10        authorized, so . . .

11              THE COURT: Okay. So 1683.

12             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

13        transcribed as follows:)

14             MR. STOSSEL: We ask Philip Morris,

15        R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and

16        Lorillard to appear on this program, none

17        would. They told us to talk to The Tobacco

18        Institute. The Institute said Anne Browder

19        will speak for them.

20             MS. BROWDER: The jury has not come in.

21              MR. STOSSEL: It may not be harmful,

22        you're not convinced?

23             MS. BROWDER: It may be or it may not be.

24        We don't know. We feel very strongly that

25        cigarette smoking is an adult custom that one 4490

1         should not even consider until they reach the

2        age of maturity.

3             MR. STOSSEL: What's maturity?

4             MS. BROWDER: Anyone over the age of 21.

5             MR. STOSSEL: These pictures are from

6        Superman II, Marlboro, made by Philip Morris,

7        is shown at least 13 times. I asked The

8        Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were shown so

9        often in Superman II.

10             MS. BROWDER: You think cigarette

11         manufacturers had something to do with that?

12             MR. STOSSEL: Yeah. I think that --

13             MS. BROWDER: Cigarette manufactures don't

14        make movies.

15             MR. STOSSEL: What do you think, that the

16        moviemaker just showed Marlboro on his own?

17             MS. BROWDER: Perhaps, the moviemaker was

18        a Marlboro smoker.

19             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

20             MR. KELLY: So clearly, your Honor, the

21         reference --

22             THE COURT: So Philip Morris' position is

23        that The Tobacco Institute spokesperson was not

24        authorized in any way to speak on behalf of

25        Philip Morris, and to the extent that Philip 4491

1        Morris could agree to place it, it was a

2        different Philip Morris entity, not a defendant

3        in this case?

4             MR. KELLY: Yes.

5             THE COURT: Okay. What's the response?

6             MR. SCAROLA: The response is that as is

7        indicated in the clip, the producers of the

8        program went to the tobacco companies and

9        wanted them to be interviewed. They said, our

10        spokesperson will be Ms. Browder from The

11         Tobacco Institute.

12             THE COURT: That's according to what the

13        newsperson said.

14             MR. SCAROLA: That's correct. But it is

15        established that The Tobacco Institute was an

16        agent of the tobacco companies, that's what the

17        evidence is, that's what the findings are.

18             MR. SALES: That's what the Court's

19        instruction is.

20             MR. SCAROLA: I think the Court has given

21         an instruction with regard to the relationship

22        of The Tobacco Institute to these defendants.

23        So they can attempt to put on evidence, if they

24        choose to, to say that she was acting outside

25        the course and scope of the responsibility that 4492

1        was designated to her and nobody told her to

2        say those things, but she was their designated

3        spokesperson.

4             And the evidence that we intend to adduce

5        is that, in fact, the manufacturers of Marlboro

6        were responsible for that product placement,

7        they paid for it. It didn't just happen

8        because -- because the producers of the film

9        happened to be Marlboro smokers.

10             THE COURT: What about the defendant paid

11         for it or who authorized it, whether it's this

12        Philip Morris International or the defendant in

13        this case, what is established in that?

14             MR. SCAROLA: I need to inquire of the

15        witness, your Honor, with regard to those

16        details. I'm not comfortable answering that

17        question based on what I know.

18             THE COURT: Which is the instruction about

19        the -- refresh my memory about the instruction

20        relating to the Institute.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Whatever the agency

22        relationship is at any point in time, the

23        representations need to fall within the scope

24        of that agency. I think it's pretty clear that

25        Ms. Browder doesn't know what she's talking 4493

1         about and wasn't prepared to talk about

2        specific issues as opposed to broader issues.

3             THE COURT: Okay. I have concerns about

4        it because she doesn't seem to know. She

5        doesn't know the answer to why, and so I think

6        that it --

7             MR. SCAROLA: Respectfully, your Honor --

8             THE COURT: -- it establishes --

9             MR. SCAROLA:  -- if she doesn't know the

10        answer, the response is, I don't know. The

11         response is not, do you think that we would

12        ever pay for that?

13             THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the

14        objection on that one.

15             What is the next one?

16             MR. KELLY: The next one is 1687. This

17        one has a longer history. It's a 1976

18        interview by a British production company,

19        television production company, who came over to

20        Philip Morris and interviewed company employees

21         for a period of a day or two, and then went

22        back to England and edited out those interviews

23        into a shorter program entitled, Death in the

24        West. And it was, given the editing -- both

25        the editing, you'll see, your Honor -- well, 4494

1        they will only show you one little piece, but

2        the clips are edited out of sequence.

3             The camera focus is very aggressive,

4        zooming in on the faces of the company

5        executives while they're smoking, making them

6        look very ominous, and because the clips are

7        incomplete, out of context, completely

8        misrepresented by the editing process in

9        England, a permanent injunction was issued by

10        the courts in England against the production

11         company as a result of the fraud that they

12        perpetrated on the company.

13             The show was never shown in the United

14        States, never shown in the United States during

15        the period of time when Mr. Piendle was

16        smoking. It has been shown, I think, on the

17        Internet now.

18             This is no foundation, your Honor. We

19        will require -- we haven't been very stringent

20        about this so far, your Honor, but we will

21         require -- request that your Honor require a

22        factual foundation for authenticity of this

23        document, of this edited record to establish

24        its reliability and to overcome the 403

25        problems. 4495

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2             MR. SCAROLA: As opposed to the witness'

3        brief about what happened.

4             THE COURT: Okay. Can I see -

5             MR. SALES: This was a subject of prior--

6             THE COURT: Didn't I defer on that?

7             MR. SALES: You did defer to the legal

8        arguments of circumstances giving rise to

9        arguments addressed.

10             THE COURT: Is this the last video?

11              MR. KELLY: I believe so, your Honor.

12             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

13        transcribed as follows:)

14             REPRESENTATIVE: From our standpoint, if

15        anyone ever identifies any ingredient in

16        tobacco or smoke as being hazardous to human

17        health or as being something that shouldn't be

18        there, we could eliminate it, but no one ever

19        has.

20             THE HOST: But your own research

21         department has identified those components.

22        Dr. Wakeham has told me that he agrees that

23        there are components in tobacco smoke which are

24        carcinogenic.

25             REPRESENTATIVE: In quantities that 4496

1        would -- that would be considered important, I

2        don't think so.

3             THE HOST: It depends on how many you

4        smoke, but he agrees that there are elements in

5        cigarettes, in the content of cigarettes which

6        are carcinogenic.

7             REPRESENTATIVE: Well, there certainly are

8        in the air of New York City.

9             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

10             THE COURT: So what is the purpose of

11         introducing it?

12             MR. SCAROLA: It is a further example of

13        the persistent denial on the part of tobacco

14        executives of the known link between cigarette

15        smoking and cancer, long after it was

16        well-established in the scientific community

17        that such a link existed.

18             THE COURT: Okay.

19             MR. SALES: And it's also relevant to

20        considering whether or not, based on this

21         executive's statement of his own smoking and

22        his persistence in smoking, of the

23        reasonableness of Mr. Piendle's smoking, and I

24        think the record is they were smoking at the

25        same time. 4497

1              THE COURT: Have I admitted or are there

2        other exhibits that are representative of

3        Philip Morris executives making statements

4        about the injurious nature at the same time as

5        this is being shown?

6             MR. KELLY: There's one coming up,

7        Exhibit 1772, which is the Waxman hearings in

8         1994.

9             MR. SCAROLA: But this is the '70s, and I

10        don't know if we have an example.

11              MR. KELLY: Mr. Cullman, which you are

12        going to let a portion of that in, Mr. Cullman

13        at Face the Nations, 1972.

14             THE COURT: Is that the one we -

15             MR. KELLY: 71. You're going to let in

16        the part where he talks about what he thinks

17        about --

18             THE COURT: Okay. So he was a Philip

19        Morris representative --

20             MR. KELLY: President.

21              THE COURT: -- and that was in 1971. When

22        was this clip?

23             MR. KELLY: 76.

24             THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to allow

25        it because I think that it's cumulative. I 4498

1         don't think that the plaintiff is being denied

2        the opportunity to present what it wants to and

3        I think that the prejudice could outweigh the

4        probative value in light of how it's being

5        presented.

6             MR. SCAROLA: May we show him being

7        interviewed on TV smoking and identify him,

8        your Honor, without the voice?

9             MR. KELLY: No, your Honor. That's

10        completely irrelevant. Before we get to

11         that-

12             MR. SCAROLA: Respectfully -- I'm sorry --

13             MR. KELLY: Do you mind if I get on the

14        record 1688 --

15             THE COURT: I'm not going to allow it,

16        even just the face.

17             MR. KELLY:  1688 is the other interview

18        from that same exercise of Dr. Wakeham. Same

19        situation.

20             THE COURT: Oh, I thought that was the

21         last video.

22             MR. KELLY: I thought they were all in the

23        same clip, but they're broken up, 1687 and

24         1688, which is from the same Death in the West

25        show, they just broke it into two. 4499

1              THE COURT: Okay. Well, then it would be

2        the same ruling.

3             MR. KELLY: Thank you, your Honor.

4             MR. SCAROLA: Do we need to see the last

5        clip?

6             MR. KELLY: I think the Waxman hearings

7        are subject to --

8             THE COURT: The Waxman hearings, I think

9        I've allowed in.

10             MR. KELLY: That's what I thought.

11              THE COURT: But they're not being the

12        version -- without the bubbles.

13             Are they here, our jurors?

14             THE BAILIFF: Yes, your Honor.

17             THE COURT: You did, I read it already.

18             MR. HENK: Is it 28 pages.

19             THE COURT: 28, kind of interesting

20        opinion.

21              THE BAILIFF: Jury entering.

22             (Thereupon, the jury entered the

23        courtroom, after which the following

24        proceedings were held:)

25             THE COURT: Okay. Welcome back. You may 4500

1        be seated.

2             Okay. You may proceed.

3             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   We are on Exhibit 3615.

6        A.   Okay. Got it.

7             THE COURT: What's the number? I'm sorry.

8             MR. SCAROLA:  3615. The Addison Yeaman,

9        Brown & Williamson strictly private and

10        confidential memorandum of July 17, 1963.

11         A.   Go ahead.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   Do you recognize this document?

14        A.   I do.

15        Q.   What is it?

16        A.   It's a document authored by Addison

17   Yeaman, who was chief general counsel for

18   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. He also served

19   on the ad hoc committee, which had lawyers from the

20   other tobacco companies that oversaw the activities

21    of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, and he

22   was commenting about sort of the implications of

23   what is going to happen with the soon-to-be released

24   Surgeon General's report. This memo is written

25   July 17th, 1963, so just a few months in advance of 4501

1   the 1964 report being issued, and he comments about

2   the function of the Tobacco Industry Research

3   Committee and also about aspects of the nature of

4   their business.

5        Q.   Is this among the documents that you

6   relied on in the formation of the opinions you have

7   described to the jury earlier?

8        A.   It is.

9             MR. SCAROLA: We would move this into

10        evidence, your Honor.

11              THE COURT: Admitted. This is the subject

12        of the prior --

13             MR. SCAROLA: There is an agreement with

14        regard to redacting certain portions of the

15        document which are not relevant for purposes of

16        this proceeding. We agreed to that.

17             THE COURT: Admitted redacted and you will

18        only show the unredacted portion.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=196
19             MR. SCAROLA: We are going to page 1 on

20        which there are no redactions.

21              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

22        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

23        Exhibit 3615.)

24     BY MR. SCAROLA:

25        Q.   Let's start off with the very first 4502

1   paragraph. I will read it and read along with me,

2   if you will, please. First of all, the title is,

3   Implications of Battelle HIPPO I and II and the

4   Griffith Filter. What is that a reference to?

5        A.   It's a reference to Battelle, which was a

6   research organization that did contract work for

7   cigarette manufacturers and their findings of a

8   project -- or two projects, HIPPO I and II that they

9   had undertaken and also some research on a new

10   filter design that had been proposed, the Griffith

11    filter.

12        Q.   It begins, "The determination by Battelle

13   of the, quote, tranquilizing, unquote, function of

14   nicotine." And let me stop right there.

15             Tell us, if you would, please, what a

16   tranquilizing function is, as understood within the

17   scientific community.

18        A.   Well, nicotine is known to have both a

19   stipulating and a relaxing effect. The relaxing

20   effect would be referred to as the tranquilizing

21    effect.

22        Q.   "The determination by Battelle of the

23   tranquilizing function of nicotine as received by

24   the human system in the delivered smoke of

25   cigarettes, together with nicotine's possible effect 4503

1    on obesity, delivers to the industry what well may

2   be its first effective instrument of propaganda

3   counter to that of the American Cancer Society, et

4   al., damning cigarettes as having a causal

5   relationship to cancer of the lung."

6             Going down to the next full paragraph.

7   "The problem is simple, if the answers are complex.

8   Assume the Surgeon General's committee concludes,

9   whatever the jargon of scientific analysis and to

10   whatever degree specific, that there is real and

11    compelling evidence of a causal or even a strongly

12   predisposing relation between smoking and cancer.

13   Cardiovascular disorders will, in all probability,

14   also be found related to smoking. Upon that event,

15   it would seem clear to us that the industry must do

16   two things."

17             And is a plan thereafter laid out for a

18   propaganda campaign?

19        A.   It talks about, yes, how they are

20   basically emphasizing the benefits of smoking,

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=197
21    specifically that it may have some relaxing effect,

22   as well as it may help people keep weight off.

23   Because nicotine is a stimulant, it speeds up the

24   system, you burn off calories at a faster rate, and

25   so they were basically saying they need to refocus 4504

1   their research and tout the benefits of smoking to

2   counter the evidence that's coming out and likely to

3   come out in the Surgeon General's report about

4   smoking and cancer and cardiovascular disease and

5   other diseases.

6        Q.   Next paragraph. "Whatever qualifications

7   we may assert to minimize the impact of the report,

8   we must face the fact that a responsible and

9   qualified group of previously noncommitted

10   scientists and medical authorities have spoken."

11   What did those responsible and qualified scientists

12   say?

13        A.   Said that cigarette smoking was the cause

14   of lung cancer in 1964 in their report.

15        Q.   Go to page 2, if you would, please. And

16   the portion right at the very top, read that for us,

17   if you would, please, Dr. Cummings.

18        A.   Again, the context here is Dr. Yeaman is

19   on the committee that oversees the TIRC and he's

20   talking about what the role of the TIRC should be in

21    this new research program to emphasize the benefits

22   and demonstrate the benefits of cigarettes.

23             It says, "The TIRC cannot, in my opinion,

24   provide the vehicle for such research. It was

25   conceived of as a public relations gesture and 4505

1   however undefiled the scientific advisory board and

2   its grants may be, it has functioned as a public

3   relations operation."

4        Q.   Move on to Exhibit 1817, which is already

5   in evidence, and this is the memorandum from George

6   Weissman to Joseph F. Cullman, III, of January 29,

7    1964.

8             You can put that up, if you would, please,

9   Keith, 1817.

10             This is the document in which, under the

11    heading Public Relations Program, the statement is

12   made, quote, "We must, in the near future, provide

13   some answers which will give smokers a psychological

14   crutch and self-rationale to continue smoking."

15             What is the historical context in which

16   this statement is being made?

17        A.   Well, it's being -- you can see from the

18   document, it talks -- the date is January 29th,

19    1964. So it's just a couple of weeks after the 1964

20   Surgeon General's report was issued, that was

21    January 11th, 1964. George Weissman is the vice

22   president of marketing for Philip Morris; Joe

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=198
23   Cullman is the president of the company. But

24   importantly, Joe Cullman is also on the executive

25   committee of The Tobacco Institute, serving as the 4506

1    spokes organization, the spokesman for all of the

2   industry participants in The Tobacco Institute at

3   that time, and they were talking about a public

4   relations program that the industry would implement

5   to basically reassure smokers that it was okay to

6   continue to smoke, so they would have that

7   self-rationale and self-psychological crutch; in

8   other words, reassurance after the Surgeon General

9   had issued his report and talks about what that

10   program will be.

11              MR. KELLY: Move to strike as interpretive

12        for at least the last two sentences of the

13        answer where he's trying to apply the meaning

14        and intent of the authors.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I think the answer was

16        entirely appropriate to place the document in

17        historical context, your Honor.

18             THE COURT: I'll overrule the objection.

19             MR. SCAROLA: Exhibit 3196, Keith.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   And when you turn to that, Dr. Cummings,

22   tell us whether you recognize that document.

23        A.   I do.

24        Q.   Identify it for us, please. What is it?

25        A.   This is a proposal from an organization 4507

1    called Tiderock Corporation to The Tobacco

2   Institute, it's November 20th, 1967, and this

3   proposal was accepted and Tiderock was hired by The

4   Tobacco Institute, and they're basically a public

5   relations firm and they had talked about what they

6   could do to reestablish the cigarette controversy.

7        Q.   We'll get into the contents of the

8   document in a moment.

9             MR. SCAROLA: I would move Exhibit 3196

10        into evidence.

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Can we approach on this

12        one, your Honor?

13             THE COURT: Yes.

14             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

15        held out of the presence of the jury:)

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: The exhibit itself,

17        again, it's from outside the industry, there

18        are handwritten marginalities all over it.

19             MR. SCAROLA: Not that I intend to show.

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Well, but you're going to

21         move it into evidence.

22             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think our copy has

23        handwritten notations on it. If it does I have

24        no problem removing it.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=199
25            MR. BIERSTEKER: I think it's a hearsay

4508

1        proposal received from a third party.

2        Mr. Scarola has represented that the proposal,

3        or the witness suggested that the proposal was

4        suggested, I don't know if s true or not, but I

5        have concerns about the document.

6             THE COURT: Tell me what the document is

7        again.

8             MR. SCAROLA: This was a company hired by

9        the tobacco industry that put together a public

10        relations campaign and, in fact, it was an

11         accepted proposal, so . . .

12             THE COURT: Did the witness testify to

13        that fact?

14             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, he just testified to

15        the fact that this proposal was accepted by The

16        Tobacco Institute. This plan was, in fact,

17        implemented. So to the extent it is a

18        third-party statement, it is a third party that

19        was an agent of the defendants, and their

20        statement was adoptively admitted by way of

21         their acceptance of the proposal.

22             MR. KELLY: May I speak for a second?

23             I think memory serves, so this is by

24        memory, that the basis for the opinion that

25        this was -- this specific recommended program 4509

1        was adopted is some budgetary records that the

2        witness has seen that indicate Tiderock was

3        paid some money after this, but I don't believe

4        there's any documentation that actually shows

5        these specific recommendations were accepted by

6        TI, although Tiderock did do some work for TI

7        after based upon the budget.

8             THE COURT: Why don't we have counsel

9        maybe establish a predicate on these issues.

10        To the extent I do allow it in. I want to see

11         what the witness has to say in redacted

12        handwritten statements are not there.

13             MR. SCAROLA: I'll be happy to reduce

14        them.

15             THE COURT: As far as whether he has

16        knowledge whether Tiderock was hired by the

17        tobacco industry to prepare this program and

18        whether this program was -- whether he knows

19        whether this program was implemented.

20             MR. KELLY: He's not going to have

21        knowledge of it. He may have documentation

22        that shows it, but he's not around at this

23        time.

24             THE COURT: Let's hear what his review of

25        the documentation tells us. 4510

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Dr. Cummings, continuing to focus our

6   attention on Exhibit 3196. Can you tell us, please,

7   what the source of the information is upon which you

8   rely to tell us that The Tobacco Institute hired the

9   Tiderock Corporation, that this was prepared for the

10   benefit of the tobacco corporation -- excuse me, The

11    Tobacco Institute?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, imprecise.

13             THE COURT: Is there still an objection

14        with that clarification?

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think it was this

16        proposal as opposed to Tiderock generally.

17             MR. SCAROLA: I'm trying to break it down

18        if I could. I want to first find out from

19        Dr. Cummings that this wasn't just voluntarily

20        submitted by Tiderock Corporation, they were

21         hired by The Tobacco Institute to do this work.

22             THE COURT: Let's -- that's the question.

23     BY MR. SCAROLA:

24        Q.   Do you understand the question?

25        A.   Yes. And the basis for my knowledge of 4511

1   the fact that they were hired to do this work is

2   that they executed this work, and I have reviewed

3   budgets from The Tobacco Institute that talk about

4   implementing the very elements that are described in

5   this proposal in 1968 and '69, with payments to

6   Tiderock for the work that they were hired to do.

7        Q.   Now, in addition to that, have you

8   actually seen materials that comply with this plan?

9        A.   I have.

10             MR. SCAROLA: On that basis, your Honor, I

11         would move Exhibit 3196 into evidence, with the

12        understanding that there are some handwritten

13        marginalia on there that have no relevance to

14        us.

15             THE COURT: What was that word?

16             MR. SCAROLA: Marginalia. Interlineation.

17        Someone wrote on the piece of paper.

18             THE COURT: Subject to the redaction of

19        marginalia, it will be moved in.

20             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

21         marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

22        Exhibit 3196.)

23             MR. BARNHART: I hadn't heard of it

24        either. I hope I don't catch it.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think it's 4512

1         contagious.

2     BY MR. SCAROLA:

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=201
3        Q.   I want to focus specifically on the

4   strategy that appears on page 2. So we've seen the

5   title of the document, it's November 20, 1967.

6   Here's the strategy. And let's look at the

7   highlighted portions, and just read those to us if

8   you would.

9        A.   "The Tiderock Corporation believes the

10   industry should pursue a program that reestablishes

11    the cigarette controversy. The program must be

12   massive. We estimate that the pressure of the

13   clearinghouse in media terms exceeds 50 million a

14   year."

15             The clearinghouse was the government

16   organization that put out the Surgeon General's

17   report, and the $50 million estimate that's there

18   relates to what we refer to as earned media, not

19   paid media. In other words, news coverage of the

20   reports that they put out.

21         Q.   So the clearinghouse published the Surgeon

22   General's report. The Surgeon General's report

23   received public attention.

24        A.   Right.

25        Q.   Newspaper accounts were published, 4513

1   interviews were conducted that were shown in the

2   popular media at the time for which the Surgeon

3   General wasn't paying out of pocket.

4        A.   Right. It was earned media.

5        Q.   And the earned media value, that is, if

6   somebody had to go out and pay for all this

7   publicity, it would have cost them, based upon what

8   Tiderock is telling The Tobacco Institute, it would

9   have cost them $50 million to get the same kind of

10   coverage.

11         A.   Correct.

12        Q.   Okay. So was this Surgeon General's

13   report supposed to put an end to the controversy?

14        A.   It was supposed to counter the information

15   coming out from the public health community.

16        Q.   No, no, the Surgeon General's report. Was

17   the Surgeon General's report intended to put an end

18   to the controversy?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   Okay. And Tiderock is telling The Tobacco

21    Institute, we need to reestablish the controversy

22   that the Surgeon General is attempting to end.

23        A.   Correct.

24        Q.   Okay. So did they do that?

25        A.   Yes, they did. 4514

1         Q.   How?

2        A.   Well, they targeted primarily the general

3   public, which they defined as their number one.

4   They had five target groups for their program which

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=202
5   they said must be massive in order to counter what

6   was coming from the government in terms of earned

7   media.

8             They said their target groups would be the

9   general public, molders of public opinion, such as

10   medical professionals, scientists, communicators,

11   press, radio, TV leaders, working journalists,

12   educators, top public officials, and the 10,000 top

13   corporate presidents, lawmakers at federal and state

14   level, tobacco industry groups, distributors,

15   growers and key suppliers, stockholders of tobacco

16   companies, and then employees of the industry.

17        Q.   So Tiderock tells The Tobacco Institute,

18   we need to reestablish the controversy, we have got

19   to counter the message that has gone out that would

20   have cost $50 million if it needed to be paid for,

21    and that occurs in November of 1967, and then we go

22   to Exhibit 2604.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: I move to strike

24        everything prior to the "let's move to exhibit"

25        whatever it was. 4515

1              MR. SCAROLA: I'm simply trying to

2        transition to the next topic, your Honor.

3             THE COURT: Okay. Well, I will grant the

4        motion and ask the jury to disregard what

5        counsel said.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Let's go to 2604 without any transition.

8             THE COURT: Direct route.

9     BY MR. SCAROLA:

10        Q.   Straight there.

11             When you get there, tell us if you

12   recognize this.

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   What is it?

15        A.   This is the white paper that was published

16   by The Tobacco Institute. It was described in the

17   Tiderock proposal as one of the elements. There

18   were many that were described in their budget in

19   that report that they would issue on an annual

20   basis. It's called "The Cigarette Controversy."

21              And there were a series of these reports

22   issued by The Tobacco Institute, widely distributed

23   to those target groups that were mentioned in

24   Tiderock, pretty much on an annual basis. And they

25   summarized the position of the tobacco industry on 4516

1    smoking and health. And it was entitled "The

2   Cigarette Controversy," and basically talked about

3   the fact that there was a controversy and that it

4   hadn't been proven that smoking causes disease.

5             MR. SCAROLA: I would move it into

6        evidence, your Honor.

7             THE COURT: Admitted.

8             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

9        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

10        Exhibit 2604.)

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   2130. Tell us what it is when you get

13   there, please.

14        A.   This is a memorandum that is sent from

15   William Kloepfer, who was a vice president at --

16   from The Tobacco Institute, to Earl C. Clements, in

17   April of 1968. Earl Clements was the president of

18   The Tobacco Institute in 1968. So it's from a

19   senior vice president of the institute to the

20   president of The Tobacco Institute. And they're

21    talking about the cigarette controversy campaign

22   that they are reestablishing and executing in April

23   of 1968.

24             MR. SCAROLA: I would move 2130 into

25        evidence, your Honor. 4517

1              THE COURT: Admitted.

2             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

3        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

4        Exhibit 2130.)

5             MR. SCAROLA: Bring it up, please.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Let's focus on number two. "Our basic

8   position in the cigarette controversy is subject to

9   the charge and may be subject to a finding that we

10   are making false or misleading statements to promote

11    the sale of cigarettes."

12             Exhibit 2186.

13        A.   That memo, by the way, was copied to all

14   the cigarette executives, including R.J. Reynolds

15   and Philip Morris.

16        Q.   When you get to 2186, a memo of

17   October 18, 1968 --

18        A.   I got it.

19        Q.   Do you recognize that?

20        A.   I do.

21         Q.   Tell us quickly, please, what it is.

22        A.   This a memo from Carl Thompson to William

23   Kloepfer at The Tobacco Institute. Carl Thompson

24   was an executive working for Hill & Knowlton at the

25   time. 4518

1              And it's talking about the publication of

2   a newsletter that was widely disseminated by The

3   Tobacco Institute called the Tobacco and Health

4   Research Newsletter. And it summarized evidence

5   from the tobacco industry's perspective about

6   smoking and health.

7             And they describe in this memo the best

8   kinds of stories that would come from this

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20opgNbr=204
9   distribution which would go to those opinion leaders

10   including reporters, newspaper editors, journalists,

11    and such.

12             MR. SCAROLA: We would move Exhibit 2186

13        into evidence.

14             THE COURT: Admitted.

15             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

16        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

17        Exhibit 2186.)

18             MR. SCAROLA: Go to page 2 of this letter,

19        please, this memorandum, and highlight the very

20        top.

21      BY MR. SCAROLA:

22        Q.   And tell us, please, what Carl Thompson

23   told William Kloepfer and other tobacco industry

24   executives about what the most important type of

25   story is. Is it a story that tells the truth? 4519

1        A.   No. It's a story that casts doubt on the

2   cause and effect theory of disease and smoking.

3   That's what they describe as the most important

4   story.

5             MR. SCAROLA: Video clip Exhibit 526 is

6        that one that we are prepared to play, Keith.

7             I believe each of these, your Honor, has

8        previously been discussed, and they are now in

9        the form that had been approved by the Court.

10             THE COURT: Okay.

11              MR. KELLY: Are they with a different

12        number now?

13             THE COURT: Which one is 526?

14             MR. SCAROLA: Project Truth.

15             THE COURT: Okay. Please play it.

16             (Thereupon, a video clip was played and

17        transcribed as follows:)

18             THE HOST: Here in Washington, a lot goes

19        on that you never hear about. Take the

20        controversy about cigarettes. In the 91st

21         Congress, a House Committee heard testimony

22        from leading experts on smoking and health.

23        The record shows that many of the country's

24        most respected doctors openly challenged

25        anti-cigarette claims. 4520

1              A California doctor says, "As a scientist,

2        I find no persuasive evidence that cigarette

3        smoking causes lung cancer."

4             A New York doctor told Congress, "To claim

5        there is now sufficient scientific evidence to

6        establish that cigarette smoking causes disease

7        is, in my opinion, unjustified."

8             There is another side to the cigarette

9        controversy. It's all here in this white

10        paper. Send for it.

11              (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   Is that one of the white papers that we

14   just looked at?

15        A.   It is. And they would issue these

16   routinely, and this was a public service ad that

17   aired in 1971 as part of a campaign called Project

18   Truth. There's another version of a TV ad that they

19   also produced.

20             And it was part of their effort to

21    disseminate the white papers that they had produced

22   refuting the evidence that smoking caused disease,

23   that many of the scientists that they cite were

24   saying quotes in the 1954 white paper that

25   Hill & Knowlton had issued in April of 1954, and 4521

1   later I found that many of those scientists were

2   also paid by the cigarette companies.

3        Q.   Is it true -- was it true, at the time

4   that this public service announcement was being

5   disseminated by the tobacco industry, that many of

6   the country's most respected scientists cast doubt

7   on the Surgeon General's findings?

8        A.   No, that was not true in 1971 at all.

9        Q.   What was the state of the consensus among

10   respected scientists in the scientific community

11    with regard to the link between smoking and health

12   hazards and death?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, cumulative.

14             THE COURT: Overruled.

15        A.   By 1971, certainly the vast majority of

16   scientists and medical professionals believed that

17   smoking caused lung cancer and was a likely cause of

18   other diseases as well. So that was the consensus.

19             In fact, Surgeon General's reports which

20   were issued on an annual basis beginning after 1964

21    were in fact consensus documents. They were reviews

22   of the summary of the scientific evidence

23   cumulatively, and that evidence only continued to

24   grow after 1964.

25             MR. SCAROLA: Joseph F. Cullman, III, was 4522

1        the Philip Morris chairman and chair of The

2        Tobacco Institute, and he appeared on Face the

3        Nation in 1971. I would like to show that

4        video clip at this time, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Which is this?

6             MR. SCAROLA: Exhibit 168IB.

7             THE COURT: Now 526, were you seeking to

8        move that into evidence?

9             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: So that is admitted.

11              MR. SCAROLA: I will not play them unless

12        it's understood that they have first been

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=206
13        admitted into evidence. If I'm mistaken about

14        that, I'm sure the defense will call that to my

15        attention.

16             THE COURT: Okay. So 1681B.

17             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

18        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

19        Exhibit 1681B.)

20             (Thereupon, a video clip was played and

21         transcribed as follows:)

22             MR. CULLMAN: We do talk to the question

23        of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous. We

24        do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.

25        We don't accept that. When, as, and if any 4523

1        ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as

2        being injurious to human health, we are

3        confident that we can eliminate that

4        ingredient.

5             THE HOST: Do you believe that cigarettes

6        are safe? Have they been proven to be safe,

7        Mr. Cullman?

8             MR. CULLMAN: I believe they have not been

9        proven to be unsafe.

10             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   Were those statements true?

13             I will rephrase the question. Do you have

14   an opinion to a reasonable degree of certainty

15   within your area of expertise as to whether the then

16   available scientific evidence confirmed or

17   conflicted with that statement?

18        A.   It's my opinion that it conflicted with

19   the statement of Mr. Cullman, who appeared

20   representing all the cigarette manufacturers as the

21   president of Philip Morris, but also as the chairman

22   of The Tobacco Institute.

23             So as the chairman of The Tobacco

24   Institute, the Executive Committee, he was asked to

25   appear on Face the Nation in January of 1971, and 4524

1   the story at the time was cigarette advertising had

2   come off television, which is why it was a news

3   story and why he appeared on that major news show.

4        Q.   Was the pledge of the tobacco industry to

5   remove any harmful ingredients from cigarettes as

6   soon as they were identified kept in the 1970s?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection to the

8        characterization and argumentative nature of

9        the question.

10             THE COURT: I'll have you rephrase.

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   You heard the pledge that was made in that

13   video clip. Was it kept in the 1970s?

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, again, to the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=207
15        word "pledge."

16             MR. SCAROLA: I will rephrase the

17        question. You need not rule on the objection.

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   Were the representations that were made by

20   the tobacco industry about what they would do as

21    soon as any harmful ingredients were identified in

22   cigarettes, was that representation fulfilled in the

23   70s?

24        A.   No.

25        Q.   Was it fulfilled in the'80s? 4525

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   Was it fulfilled in the'90s?

3        A.   No.

4        Q.   Has it been fulfilled today?

5        A.   No.

6             MR. SCAROLA: Exhibit 1687C, the bowling

7        video clip.

8             Let's go to the Wakeham video clip,

9         1688 ~

10             MR. KELLY: No, I don't think so.

11              MR. SCAROLA: Not that one either.

12             MR. KELLY: Pick another number.

13             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, I'll pick 2268.

14             I knew they'd tell me if I was wrong,

15        counting on it.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   2268. Do you recognize that document?

18        A.   I do.

19        Q.   Tell us what this is, please.

20        A.   Sure. This is a memo that was written to

21    CTR file by a Dr. Seligman, who is a scientist at

22   Philip Morris Tobacco Company, regarding a meeting

23   of basically the oversight committee for the Council

24   for Tobacco Research.

25        Q.   That's what CTR stands for when it says 4526

1    CTR file, it's Council for Tobacco Research file?

2        A.   Yes. And as I had explained yesterday,

3   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee created in

4    1954 changed its name in March of 1964 to Council

5   for Tobacco Research. It's the same organization,

6   same oversight, with the executives of the company

7   and their legal counsel that would basically set

8   policy, and they would have regular meetings to talk

9   about the role of the industry, and they were

10   talking about what they should be doing with the

11    Council for Tobacco Research.

12             And this particular memo talks at length

13   because a number of members at that meeting, and

14   there were a number of company representatives at

15   that meeting, were talking about what the history

16   had been of the Tobacco Industry Research

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=208
17   Committee/CTR, what their main purpose had been in

18   funding the search that they funded. And they

19   describe it in some detail in this memo.

20             MR. SCAROLA: We would move 2268 into

21         evidence, your Honor.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: May we approach on this

23        one, your Honor?

24             THE COURT: Yes. 25

4527

1              (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

2        held out of the presence of the jury:)

3             THE COURT: I note that there is an

4        attorney-client privilege on this.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor. On the

6        last page they're talking about the need for

7        expert witnesses. You look at the first page,

8        a bunch of in-house general counsel. I don't

9        know if this is an appropriate one to be using,

10        and I would object on the basis of privilege

11         for this one.

12             MR. SCAROLA: May I show - I think I

13        already provided counsel for defendant --

14        there's the specific excerpts that we propose.

15             THE COURT: Well, what do you respond to

16        their privilege exception?

17             MR. SCAROLA: Crime-fraud exception.

18             THE COURT: So this is part of the same

19        discussion you had basically about the other

20        document?

21              MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: With respect, I don't

23        think there's been any showing of the kind

24        that's necessary to establish a crime-fraud

25        exception with respect to this document. 4528

1              MR. SCAROLA: And our position is that the

2        Engle findings themselves provide adequate

3        support for that. CTR was obviously an agent

4        of the tobacco industry, I believe it's

5        acknowledged to have been an agent in the

6        tobacco industry, and the plans that are laid

7        out here in this memo are clearly plans that

8        forward the conspiracy.

9             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, can I get a little

10        context? There's reference there to special

11        projects. Special projects was a subsidiary

12        group among the Scientific Advisory Board that

13        was set up separately. It wasn't any kind of

14        fraudulent setup, it was -- because of the

15        activities of the special projects group, they

16        separated them from these Scientific Advisory

17        Board responsibilities for granting research

18        funds to independent researchers. That's the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=209
19        reference to special projects there. It is to

20        avoid the --

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me chime in. There

22        were two grant programs under CTR. The first

23        one was much like Dr. Cummings described with

24        respect to National Cancer Institute, people

25        would submit proposals to the independent 4529

1         Scientific Advisory Board that evaluates them

2        for scientific merits as to whether -- which

3        ones got the tobacco funding or not.

4             There was an entirely separate program,

5        special projects, run by lawyers for a variety

6        of purposes or to address issues that might

7        arise in litigation in which they wanted to

8        have research done and so forth, where we're

9        blurring on the distinction here and privilege.

10             THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the

11        privilege objection.

12             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

13        concluded and the following proceedings were

14        held within the presence of the jury:)

15             MR. SCAROLA: Are we prepared with 1683,

16        the Anne Browder video clip?

17             Your Honor, at this time we would publish

18        a video clip of Ms. Anne Browder's appearance

19        in 1983 on the 20/20 TV show.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   Dr. Cummings, tell us who Anne Browder was

22   back in 1983.

23             THE COURT: Which number is this?

24             MR. SCAROLA: It is 1683.

25             THE COURT: I think didn't we discuss that 4530

1         one?

2             MR. SCAROLA: We have with some requested

3        editing, your Honor.

4             MR. KELLY: There should be an edit for

5        this, a brief portion.

6             MR. SCAROLA: Correct.

7             THE COURT: Okay.

8        A.   Anne Browder was one of -- a number of

9   spokespeople who regularly went out and made

10   appearances on television, on radio, and also gave

11    interviews to the press when requested. She was an

12   employee of The Tobacco Institute. There were a

13   variety of them. Connie Drath, William Dwyer,

14   Walker Merryman, Brennan Moran were among some of

15   the others.

16             She appeared on national TV shows during

17   the 1970s and '80s. This particular clip is from an

18   appearance in which she was asked to appear on

19   behalf -- speaking on behalf of the major cigarette

20   manufacturers on a show 20/20, which is still on TV

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=210
21    today. John Stossel is the reporter. This is

22   October of 1983,1 believe the clip is from.

23             MR. SCAROLA: Please play.

24             (Thereupon, a video clip was played and

25        was transcribed as follows:) 4531

1              THE HOST: We asked Philip Morris,

2        R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and

3        Lorillard to appear on this program. None

4        would. They told us to talk to The Tobacco

5        Institute. The Institute said Anne Browder

6        would speak for them.

7             MS. BROWDER: The jury has not come in.

8             THE HOST: It may not be harmful. You're

9        not convinced.

10             MS. BROWDER: It may be or it may not be.

11        We don't know.

12             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

13     BY MR. SCAROLA:

14        Q.   Did they know?

15        A.   They knew. But this was part of the

16   reassurance campaign that had been started in 1954,

17   was re-established in 1968, and continued through

18   the '70s and '80s where they would have their

19   spokespeople appear and cast doubt on the smoking

20   and health strategy, as they described it, as a

21   brilliantly conceived strategy specifically to do

22   that to claim there was a controversy to create

23   doubt in the public's mind to sway the opinion,

24   specifically to give people a psychological crutch

25   and self-rationale to keep smoking. 4532

1              MR. KELLY: Move to strike as

2        nonresponsive after the first word, I think.

3        All of that is argument.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I can ask another question

5        that will elicit the same testimony.

6             MR. KELLY: It's not hard to get it, but

7        it should be stricken.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I would be happy to ask -

9             THE COURT: I'll grant the motion to have

10        that stricken and allow counsel to ask the next

11         question.

12     BY MR. SCAROLA:

13        Q.   What relationship, if any, did Anne

14   Browder's appearance and position have to the

15   agreed-upon strategy to prolong this fabricated

16   conspiracy as long as -- sorry, this fabricated

17   controversy as long as possible?

18        A.   Anne Browder was executing the plan and

19   paid for campaign to talk about smoking as a health

20   controversy creating doubt on the health charge, and

21    that was her appearance on the 20/20 show, as well

22   as many other appearances. I've got over 3,000

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=211
23   clips of The Tobacco Institute spokespeople speaking

24   over the almost 50-year period of that

25   organization's history. 4533

1              MR. SCAROLA: Exhibit 12, please, which I

2        believe is already admitted into evidence. Put

3        that up for us, please. And can you try,

4        Keith, to enlarge the date in the upper

5        right-hand corner.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   1984 R.J. Reynolds?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And tell us, please, just read the

10   highlighted portions of this -- was this published

11    as a full-page advertisement?

12        A.   In major magazines, Time, Newsweek, also

13   in newspapers. So it was part of a campaign. It

14   was rather unique, because this was as an issue

15   campaign from a manufacturer, in this case,

16   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which was a little

17   bit of a switch from what we had seen up until that

18   point with The Tobacco Institute speaking on behalf

19   of the manufacturers.

20        Q.   So this is R.J. Reynolds, we know that,

21    their name is right on the ad, and what they say is,

22   first, they ask the question, "Can we have an open

23   debate about smoking?" And then they say, "Over the

24   years, you've heard so many negative reports about

25   smoking and health, and so little to challenge these 4534

1   reports, that you may assume the case against

2   smoking is closed. But this is far from the truth.

3   Because we think reasonable people who analyze it

4   may come to see this issue not as a closed case, but

5   as an open controversy. We don't say there are no

6   questions about smoking, just the opposite. We say

7   there are lots of questions, but as of yet, in 1984,

8   no simple answers."

9             Was there a simple answer, in 1984, as to

10   whether smoking caused cancer?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   What was it?

13        A.   It did.

14        Q.   Was there a simple answer in 1984 as to

15   whether nicotine was addictive?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   Was it?

18        A.   Yes.

19        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 3845A, a video clip of

20   Mr. Heimann, and while Keith is getting that ready

21    for us, a December 19, 1986 deposition excerpt, as

22   sworn testimony given by Mr. Heimann, tell us who

23   Mr. Heimann was.

24        A.   Robert Heimann was the president of

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=212
25   American Tobacco and he is giving a sworn deposition 4535

1   in 1986, and this is the video testimony of him

2   answering questions about his view of the public's

3   reliance on the statements that were issued by his

4   company and The Tobacco Institute.

5             MR. SCAROLA: Please play that, Keith.

6             (Thereupon, the video clip was played and

7        transcribed as follows:)

8        Q.   Mr. Heimann, would you state your full

9   name.

10        A.   Robert K. Heimann.

11         Q.   You understand that it's your deposition

12   and your testimony today is just as though you were

13   in court testifying before the judge and jury?

14        A.   I do understand that.

15        Q.   You have been designated as a witness by

16   American Tobacco Company in response to a request

17   that they produced, and I won't belabor the various

18   aspects of the company, and I'd like to go over the

19   information which you possess very briefly.

20             What source of expectations concerning the

21   product which a consumer has are the advertisements

22   of that product; is that accurate?

23        A.   I remember that.

24        Q.   Would you expect a consumer to rely upon

25   your advertisements? 4536

1        A.   Yes. Our advertising is truthful, and we

2   would anticipate that they would rely on it, if they

3   chose.

4        Q.   That's your promise as to what the

5   consumer can expect from your product, isn't it?

6        A.   Yes, it is.

7        Q.   Now, throughout your tenure with American,

8   it was not only American's position, but your

9   position that cigarettes weren't injurious to

10   health; is that accurate?

11         A.   (Inaudible.)

12        Q.   Yes.

13        A.   Yes, that is so.

14        Q.   That's something American Tobacco wanted

15   the public to believe; is that correct?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   It's a statement that American Tobacco

18   (inaudible.)

19        A.   We -- we issued that statement, yes.

20        Q.   (Inaudible.)

21         A.   -- (inaudible) believe it.

22        Q.   (Inaudible) justified and relied on that

23   statement?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   I want to show you what's marked as 4537

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=213
1   Plaintiffs Exhibit 17, which is simply a package of

2   Pall Mall cigarettes that's currently being sold.

3   Can you identify that as a package of Pall Mall?

4        A.   Yes, sir.

5        Q.   Can you read the warning that's placed on

6   that for us, please.

7        A.   "Surgeon General's warning: Quitting

8   smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your

9   health."

10        Q.   That is not a warning that is voluntarily

11   placed there by American Tobacco, is it?

12        A.   No, it's not.

13        Q.   Would you put that warning there if

14   Congress didn't require it?

15        A.   No.

16        Q.   Okay. (Inaudible.)

17        A.   Certainly do.

18        Q.   You don't think they harm smokers so

19   (inaudible).

20        A.   We believe our product is not injurious to

21    health.

22        Q.   As far as you're concerned -- as far as

23   you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply

24   wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes

25   lung cancer? 4538

1        A.   I would use the term "misguided."

2        Q.   If it's misguided, then I take it that, in

3   your opinion, he's wrong?

4        A.   I was simply trying to be polite about it.

5        Q.   Not being polite about it, would he be

6   wrong?

7        A.   Dead wrong.

8        Q.   Congress was wrong in applying these

9   warnings, correct?

10        A.   We do not think they're justified.

11         Q.   So they're wrong?

12        A.   They're wrong.

13             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

14     BY MR. SCAROLA:

15        Q.   Did the position of the tobacco industry

16   that there was nothing dangerous about cigarettes

17   end in 1986, when Mr. Heimann was giving that

18   testimony?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 1433, please. I'd

21    like you to take a look at that. I'd like you to

22   tell us whether you recognize it.

23        A.   I do.

24        Q.   Describe in general terms, without getting

25   into the contents, not only what it is, but how it 4539

1    came to be.

2        A.   Sure. This is a letter sent to a

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=214
3   principal of an elementary school located in

4   Amherst, New York, the same community I live in, and

5   it's dated January 11th, 1990, and it's from

6   RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company, their manager of

7   public information, Jo Spach, and this letter was

8   sent to the principal following a lecture that I had

9   given to the fifth graders at the elementary school,

10   because I was invited in, as I have been every year,

11    and I still do the lectures to the fifth grade, by

12   the school nurse, and I ask the teachers what the

13   students were learning at the time and they were

14   learning how to write letters, business letters.

15   And I suggested that the students write letters to

16   the cigarette companies and ask them why they allow

17   their logos to be used on toy and candy products.

18   And so letters were sent to the different companies.

19        Q.   By fifth graders?

20        A.   The letters were written by the fifth

21    graders, and this letter came back to the principal,

22   and the nurse who had invited me in to give the talk

23   called me up and sent me the letter, and so there is

24   the letter.

25             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, we would move 4540

1        Exhibit 1433 into evidence.

2             THE COURT: I think we took this one up

3        already.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: We did.

5             THE COURT: Yeah. So it's admitted.

6             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

7        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

8        Exhibit 1433.)

9             MR. SCAROLA: Would you put that up for

10        us, please, Keith.

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   Let's start right at the top. First of

13   all, it's on the stationery of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

14   Company, correct?

15        A.   That's correct.

16        Q.   It's addressed to the principal of the

17   Willow Ridge School in Amherst, New York, correct?

18        A.   That's correct.

19        Q.   Let's go to the signature line so we can

20   see the -- look at the content of the letter. It is

21    signed by Jo P. Spach, manager public information,

22   public relations department of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

23   Company, and let's see what the position of

24   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is to fifth graders --

25             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, your Honor. 4541

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   -- in January of 1990.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, your Honor,

4        mischaracterization.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=215
5             THE COURT: Well, the letter speaks for

6        itself as to whom it is addressed, so we can go

7        to the content of the letter.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   Read it for us, please, Dr. Cummings.

10        A.   Sure. It says, "The tobacco industry is

11    also concerned about the charges being made that

12   smoking is responsible for so many serious diseases.

13   Long before the present criticism began, the tobacco

14   industry, in a sincere attempt to determine what

15   harmful effects, if any, smoking might have on human

16   health established the Council for Tobacco Research

17   U.S.A. The industry has also supported research

18   grants directed by the American Medical Association.

19   Over the years, the tobacco industry has given in

20   excess of $162 million to independent research on

21    the controversy surrounding smoking, more than all

22   the voluntary health associations combined. Despite

23   all the research going on, the simple and

24   unfortunate fact is the scientists do not know the

25   cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to 4542

1   be associated with smoking."

2        Q.   Let stop right there. The entire letter

3   will be available to the jury to read later.

4             Was it true, in response to letters sent

5   by fifth graders, to tell the principal of their

6   school in January of 1990, despite all the research

7   going on, the simple and unfortunate fact is

8   scientists do not know the cause or causes of the

9   chronic diseases reported to be associated with

10   smoking?

11         A.   No, that was a false statement. This is

12   25 years after the Surgeon General's report was

13   issued. So 25 Surgeon General's reports later, and

14   this is what major cigarette company, R.J. Reynolds,

15   told -- reported in the letter and then asked the

16   principal to share with the students.

17        Q.   Exhibit 1512, please. Do you recognize

18   that document?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   What is it?

21         A.   This is among many thousands of letters

22   that I've seen from the tobacco companies are in the

23   files that I've studied, and this is a letter

24   written May 1st, 1968 to a fourth grade teacher,

25   fourth graders, actually, from an elementary school 4543

1   in Tacoma, Washington. So May 1st, 1968, and it's

2   virtually the same letter that the students or the

3   principal at Willow Ridge Elementary School received

4   in January of 1990, contrasting over that 25-year

5   period what they were telling school children what

6   was known about the health risks of smoking.

7             MR. SCAROLA: We would move 1252 into

8        evidence, your Honor.

9             THE COURT: It's admitted.

10             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

11         marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

12        Exhibit 1252.)

13             MR. SCAROLA: Would you put that up,

14        Keith, so we can see with our own eyes what the

15        tobacco industry was telling fourth graders.

16        Fourth photograph down, enlarge that for us,

17        please.

18     BY MR. SCAROLA:

19        Q.   "Despite many years of extensive research,

20   medical science has been unable to establish that

21    smoking has a direct causal link with any human

22   disease. We are firmly of the opinion, however,

23   that definite answers to the many unanswered smoking

24   and health questions and the true causes of human

25   disease can be determined only by scientific 4544

1   research. Our company intends, therefore, to

2   continue to support such research until the truth is

3   known."

4             Was the truth known in 1968, just as it

5   was known in 1990?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   Did The Tobacco Institute ever, throughout

8   its entire history, ever admit that smoking caused

9   disease?

10        A.   No. Through the entire history from 1958

11    when The Tobacco Institute was incorporated until

12   they went out of business in 1998, they never

13   admitted that smoking caused any human disease.

14        Q.   Exhibit 177 --

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Before we move on,

16        Mr. Scarola, I think you misspoke. You said

17         1968,1 think it says 1963.

18        A.   It's '68. I can tell you because they're

19   referencing CTR, which changed its name in '64.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   May 1, 1968.

22        A.   The paragraph above the one that's

23   highlighted. It does look like a 3,1 agree.

24        Q.   In case there's any doubt about this, how

25   do you know that it's '68 and not '63? 4545

1        A.   Because the paragraph above talks about

2   the fact that the industry established The Council

3   for Tobacco Research and that was an organization

4   that was named in 1964. And so it can't be 1963

5   because The Council for Tobacco Research wasn't

6   named until March of 1964.

7        Q.   Okay. Let's go to Exhibit 1772, please,

8   another video clip.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=217
9             And this is April 15, 1994. We're going

10   the play the video clip and then I ask you to set it

11    in historic context for us, please.

12             (Thereupon, the video was played and

13        transcribed as follows:)

14             NARRATOR: Mr. Campbell, you were also

15        deposed and you said, quote, to my knowledge,

16        it has not been proven that cigarette smoking

17        causes cancer. This is a rather passive and

18        pleasant approach, especially in light of the

19        consensus, not by some, but all of the

20        scientific community. Will you ever be

21         convinced and what evidence are you waiting

22        for?

23             And let's have the microphone passed over.

24             MR. CAMPBELL: Yes, I may be convinced.

25        We don't know what causes cancer in general 4546

1        right now. So I think that we may find out

2        what causes cancer and we may find out some

3        relationship, which has yet to be proven.

4             (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

5     BY MR. SCAROLA:

6    Q. Had it been proven?

7    A. It had been.

8        Q.   What were the circumstances of that

9   appearance, what were we watching?

10        A.   That was a congressional hearing where the

11    executives of the major companies, Mr. Campbell

12   appearing on behalf of Philip Morris appeared and

13   gave sworn testimony in front of a congressional

14   committee on a variety of issues related to smoking

15   and health, including nicotine addiction and their

16   views on smoking and health, and that's 1994 and,

17   again, reflects the consistent statements made by

18   the companies during this nearly 50-year period.

19        Q.   Did these defendants or any major tobacco

20   company ever admit the link between smoking and lung

21    cancer at any time during the period of time that

22   Charlie Piendle was smoking from the late '50s to

23    1989?

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, argumentative.

25             THE COURT: Overruled. 4547

1        A.   No, they never admitted during the time

2   that Mr. Piendle was a cigarette smoker that it

3   caused lung cancer.

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   Let's go to Exhibit 3677, please.

6        A.   Okay.

7        Q.   We're going to begin to focus -- we have

8   been looking at the health risks associated with

9   smoking. We're shifting our focus onto the

10   addiction issue, and tell us, please, whether you

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=218
11    recognize this document.

12        A.   Yes. This is a speech that was given by

13   William Dunn, who was a scientist at Philip Morris.

14   He ran their human psychology program called Motives

15   and Incentives in Cigarette Smoking. It was a

16   speech given in October of 1972 at a meeting of

17   scientists, the CORESTA meeting, which is an

18   organization of primarily tobacco -- people

19   interested in doing tobacco research, particularly

20   chemists, but it talks about why people smoke and it

21    was a speech approved by high levels of the company

22   to be given by Dr. Dunn at that meeting.

23             MR. SCAROLA: We would move this document

24        into evidence, your Honor.

25             THE COURT: It's admitted. 4548

1              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

2        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

3        Exhibit 3677.)

4     BY MR. SCAROLA:

5        Q.   All right. The title reads Motives and

6   Incentives in Cigarette Smoking by William L. Dunn,

7   Jr., Philip Morris Research Center, Richmond,

8   Virginia, and take us, please, to the most

9   significant aspects of this report in terms of the

10   support provided for the opinions that you've

11    already seen.

12        A.   Well, this is a speech about why people

13   smoke, and he talks about, again, a variety of

14   theories and lays out his opinion as to why people

15   smoke, and he does so in a fair amount of detail and

16   then he plugs a book called Motives and Incentives,

17   which is a summary of a conference that had been

18   held earlier which was the proceedings of that

19   conference. But this is a speech that did not

20   appear in the book, it's just the speech given by

21    Dr. Dunn.

22             MR. KELLY: I need to object, your Honor.

23        Move to strike to the extent that the witness

24        is interpreting Dr. Dunn's motives and intent

25        drafting this speech to be given at CORESTA. 4549

1        There's no foundation for that.

2             MR. SCAROLA: I don't believe that he's

3        done that, your Honor.

4             THE COURT: To the extent that the

5        testimony can be interpreted, as this witness'

6        interpretation of the intent behind giving the

7        speech, I will strike the testimony.

8     BY MR. SCAROLA:

9        Q.   What does Dr. Dunn tell those to whom he

10   is speaking about smoking and addiction?

11         A.   Well, he says without nicotine, the

12   argument goes, there would be no smoking. And then

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=219
13   he goes on to talk about the strong evidence can be

14   marshaled to support that argument and points out

15   that on page 4, "No one has ever become a cigarette

16   smoker by smoking cigarettes without nicotine. Most

17   of the physiological responses to inhaled smoke have

18   been shown to be nicotine-related. Despite many low

19   nicotine brand entries into the marketplace, none of

20   them have captured a substantial segment of the

21    market. 94 percent of the cigarettes sold in the

22   U.S. deliver more than 1 milligram of nicotine.

23   98.5 percent of delivery more than .9 milligrams of

24   nicotine, and the physiological response to nicotine

25   can be readily be elicited by cigarettes delivering 4550

1   in the range of 1 milligram of nicotine."

2        Q.   What does "physiological response" mean?

3        A.   That's the biological response,

4   essentially the nicotine coming into your

5   bloodstream and getting to your brain and giving the

6   smoker the effect that they're seeking in the brain,

7   mainly the dopamine release.

8        Q.   All right, sir, go to Exhibit 2044.

9        A.   If you go to the next page --

10        Q.   I'm sorry.

11         A.   -- of that document, on page 5 --

12             MR. KELLY: I object, your Honor. The

13        witness is leading counsel.

14             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, he is, and in the right

15        direction, I might add. Thank you for helping

16        me to not overlook this.

17        A.   It talks about the importance of nicotine

18   and he talks about in his speech, why, then, there

19   is not a market for nicotine, per se, to be "eaten,

20   sucked, drunk, injected, inserted, or inhaled as a

21   pure aerosol. The answer, and I feel quite strongly

22   about this is that the cigarette is, in fact, among

23   the most awe-inspiring examples of the ingenuity of

24   man. Let me explain my conviction.

25              "The cigarette should be conceived not as 4551

1    a product, but as a package. The product is

2   nicotine. The cigarette is but one of many package

3   layers. There's the carton, which contains the

4   pack, which contains the cigarettes, which contains

5   the smoke. The smoke is the final package. The

6   smoker must strip off all these package layers to

7   get that which he seeks. Think of the cigarette

8   pack as a storage container for a day's supply of

9   nicotine. Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for

10   a dose unit of nicotine. Think of the puff of smoke

11    as the vehicle of nicotine, and smoke is beyond

12   question, the most optimized vehicle of nicotine and

13   the cigarette, the most optimized dispenser of

14   smoke."

15     BY MR. SCAROLA:

16        Q.   I think you had told us during your

17   earlier testimony about the perception within the

18   industry of the cigarette as a nicotine delivery

19   system. Is this among the documents upon which you

20   relied to demonstrate that the industry itself

21    understood that what they were doing was selling a

22   nicotine delivery system?

23        A.   Yes. Among the documents, there are many.

24   Obviously, I could bring lots of documents, but I

25   have only brought a handful because we'd be here for 4552

1   weeks.

2        Q.   Do I have your permission to go to 2044?

3        A.   You do.

4        Q.   Let's go. Tell us what it is, please.

5        A.   This is a report written by Dr. Claude

6   Teague, who is a chemist at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

7   Company. In fact, he's vice president for research

8   and development -- or assistant director, I should

9   say, of research and development at R.J. Reynolds at

10   the time this is written in March 1972. It's

11    written to his boss, Murray Sencus, and it's talking

12   about a new type of cigarette delivering a

13   satisfying amount of nicotine with a reduced tar to

14   nicotine ratio and it's a research planning

15   memorandum that he authored and signed on

16   March 28th, 1972.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I move 2044 into

18        evidence.

19             THE COURT: It's admitted.

20             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

21         marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

22        Exhibit 2044.)

23             MR. SCAROLA: Keith, if you would, please,

24        I want to skip right to page 7 of this

25        document. 4553

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   And the paragraph that begins, "in

3   theory."

4        A.   Sure.  "In theory and probably in fact, a

5   given smoker, on a given day, has a rather fixed per

6   hour and per day requirement for nicotine. Given a

7   cigarette that delivers less nicotine than he

8   desires, the smoker will subconsciously adjust his

9   puff volume and frequency and smoking frequency so

10   as to obtain and maintain his per hour and per day

11    requirement for nicotine or, more likely, will

12   change to a brand delivering his desired per

13   cigarette level of nicotine. Thus, despite the

14   philosophy of our critics, there can be no virtue or

15   logic in reducing per cigarette nicotine level below

16   that desired by the smoker."

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=221
17        Q.   Is this one of the documents you

18   referenced in supporting your opinion expressed

19   earlier that cigarette companies knew that when they

20   reduced the amount of nicotine carrying smoke that

21    was reaching the lungs, by putting filters on

22   cigarettes, all they were doing was encouraging

23   people to puff harder and buy more?

24        A.   Correct. It talks about the need for a

25   certain amount of nicotine in the product to keep 4554

1   the smoker smoking, and this document talks about

2   tar and nicotine ratios and the relevance of that.

3        Q.   Exhibit 1920. This is an R.J. Reynolds

4   memorandum on the nature of the tobacco business and

5   the crucial role of nicotine therein, again, by

6   R.J. Reynolds scientist, Claude E. Teague, dated

7   April 14, 1972. Do you recognize this document?

8        A.   I do.

9        Q.   Is it one that you relied upon?

10        A.   It is.

11              MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I move 1920 into

12        evidence.

13             THE COURT:  1920 is not in my notebook,

14        but 1820 is.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I think 1920 is the right

16        one, and I'm sorry if I didn't provide

17        your Honor with one, but have my copy. There

18        are a couple of sections of this --

19             THE COURT: Okay. It's admitted.

20             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

21         marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

22        Exhibit 1920.)

23             MR. SCAROLA: -- that we want to go

24        through rather quickly. Let me provide

25        your Honor also with the additional sections. 4555

1        Thank you.

2             If you would put that up, please, Keith,

3        and just take us to the previously designated

4        highlighted portions, and without comment,

5        we're just going to read through these and with

6        the understanding, again, that the entire

7        document will be in evidence.

8        A.   Right. Title of the document is Research

9   Planning Memorandum on the Nature of the Tobacco

10   Business and the Crucial Role of Nicotine Therein.

11      BY MR. SCAROLA:

12        Q.   And the memorandum says, "In a sense, the

13   tobacco industry may be thought of as being a

14   specialized, highly ritualized, and stylized segment

15   of the pharmaceutical industry. Tobacco products

16   uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug

17   with a variety of physiological effects. Thus, a

18   tobacco product is, in essence, a vehicle for

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=222
19   delivery of nicotine designed to deliver the

20   nicotine in a generally acceptable and attractive

21    form."

22             Next.

23              "Happily, for the tobacco industry,

24   nicotine is both habituating and unique in its

25   variety of physiological actions, hence, no other 4556

1    active material or combination of materials provides

2   equivalent, quote, satisfaction, unquote.

3              "If nicotine is the sine qua non of

4   tobacco products and tobacco products are recognized

5   as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then

6   it is logical to design our products and, where

7   possible, are advertising around nicotine delivery

8   rather than tar delivery for flavor."

9             Next.

10             "If what we have said about the habituated

11    smoker is true, then products designed for him

12   should emphasize nicotine, nicotine delivery

13   efficiency, nicotine satisfaction, and the like.

14   What we should really make and sell would be the

15   proper dosage form of nicotine with as many other

16   built-in attractions and gratifications as possible.

17   That is, an efficient nicotine delivery system with

18   satisfactory flavor, mildness, convenience, cost,

19   et cetera.

20             "If our business is fundamentally that of

21    supplying nicotine in useful dosage form, why is it

22   really necessary that allegedly harmful tar

23   accompany that nicotine? There should be some

24   simpler, cleaner more efficient and direct way to

25   provide the desired nicotine dosage than the present 4557

1    system involving combustion in tobacco or even

2   chewing of tobacco.

3              "Indicated research department activities

4   and approaches. If the above is a valid line of

5   reasoning, then our long term future courses of

6   action should be as follows: More precisely define

7   the minimum amount of nicotine required or

8   satisfaction in terms of dose levels, dose

9   frequency, dosage form, and the like."

10             How was satisfaction understood within the

11    scientific community as used within that context,

12   what was being satisfied?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Objection, calls for

14        interpretation, lack of foundation.

15             MR. SCAROLA: To the extent that it does,

16        your Honor, it is interpretation of a

17        scientifically technical term.

18             THE COURT: I'll allow the question.

19        Overruled.

20        A.   It relates to the effect of nicotine in

21    the brain, mainly the reinforcing effect of

22   nicotine, releasing brain chemical, such as dopamine

23   and serotonin as a result of puffing on a cigarette

24   where you get nicotine delivered rapidly to the

25   brain. 4558

1              THE COURT: Can I have counsel approach?

2             MR. SCAROLA: I was about to ask, thank

3        you.

4             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

5        held out of the presence of the jury:)

6             THE COURT: We need to conclude that

7        direct.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I think I'm within 15

9        minutes, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: Okay.

11              MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, I'm missing the

12        target. There have been a lot of bench

13        conferences.

14             THE COURT: 5:15.

15             MR. SCAROLA: 5:20.

16             THE COURT: Direct is over by 5:20.

17             MR. SCAROLA: I can't promise that. These

18        are documents I have, I think I'm very close.

19             THE COURT: I haven't told them. We've

20        gone a long time.

21              MR. SCAROLA: I understand that, but since

22        the witness has to come back tomorrow anyway --

23             THE COURT: It's not so much about the

24        witness, it's concluding to move the case

25        along. So 5:20. 4559

1              MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to do the very

2        best I can. Thank you.

3             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

4        concluded and the following proceedings were

5        held within the presence of the jury:)

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   We are going to do our very best to finish

8   by 5:20 with your direct examination. So we're

9   going to move very quickly, and you'll forgive me if

10   I seem to be pushing you along.

11              Exhibit 1233, it's an interoffice

12   memorandum, the subject is Cigarette Concept to

13   Assure RJR a Larger Segment of the Youth Market, and

14   it is from Frank G. Colby to Mr. R.A. Blevins, the

15   director of marketing and planning for

16   R.J. Reynolds. Who was Mr. Colby?

17        A.   Mr. Colby was a scientist working for

18   R.J. Reynolds and he's a long-term employee of

19   Reynolds and was Dr. Teague's boss at the time.

20             MR. SCAROLA: I would move 1233 into

21         evidence, your Honor.

22             THE COURT: Admitted.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=224
23             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

24        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

25        Exhibit 1233.) 4560

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   This document says, "In my judgment, for

3   public relations reasons, it would be impossible to

4   go back all the way to the 1955 type cigarettes."

5             Remember, we're talking about getting a

6   larger segment of the youth market.

7              "As far as tar and nicotine and smoke are

8   concerned, I believe it should be possible to

9   achieve the desired effect by going to a tar level

10   of today's Pall Mall, nonfilter type of about

11    29 milligrams tar and 1.8 milligrams nicotine.

12   Still with an old style filter, any desired

13   additional nicotine kick could be easily obtained

14   through pH regulation."

15             How does pH regulation impact upon the

16   nicotine kick?

17        A.   Well, if you were using more nicotine in

18   the product to give you more delivery of nicotine,

19   the nicotine is an irritant, so pH, actually, such

20   as ammonia, urea, and other pH modifiers reduces the

21    harshness, so it makes it easier to inhale. And if

22   you go to subject of that memo, it explains why they

23   want a less harsh product.

24             Upper left of that memo, if you'd just

25   blow that up. 4561

1              So they were talking about designing a

2   product to assure a larger share of the youth

3   market.

4        Q.   All right, sir, we're going to skip to

5   page 3. "The nicotine in the blood acts upon the

6   central nervous system and produces, in the average

7   smoker, a sensation one could describe as both

8   stimulating and relaxing. It is important to know

9   that an individual who smokes regularly thoroughly

10   enjoys this sensation. It can be assumed that the

11    amount of nicotine that is required to get this

12   desired effect varies from person to person."

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think you're on a

14        different exhibit, Mr. Scarola.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I apologize.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: There's no page 3 on this

17        one.

18             MR. SCAROLA: You're absolutely right,

19        I've gone to 3746 in my haste.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   So let's identify 3746. Is it an

22   R.J. Reynolds memorandum from Murray Senkus,

23   June 23rd, 1974 and August 4, 1976.

24             Who is Mr. Senkus?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=225
25        A.   Murray Senkus is a senior scientist at 4562

1   Reynolds. This is actually a speech that he's

2   giving to senior management at R.J. Reynolds in 1974

3   and R.J. Reynolds International, again, in 1976, and

4   it's on the subject of smoking satisfaction and the

5   subject of the memo is about nicotine's effect on

6   smoking satisfaction.

7        Q.   All right. We're going to skip, for

8   purposes of time, to page 7, predesignated section

9   there, and I'm going to read the second paragraph in

10   the predesignated section.

11              "From this standpoint, a zero nicotine

12   cigarette or zero nicotine tar has no taste in the

13   mouth, yields no nicotine in the lung and, hence,

14   really has no potential to provide smoking

15   satisfaction."

16             Exhibit 1820.

17             THE COURT: Were you seeking to have that

18        admitted?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, your Honor.

20             THE COURT: Okay. Admitted.

21              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

22        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

23        Exhibit 3746.)

24             THE COURT: What number?

25             MR. SCAROLA: We're now on 1820. 4563

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Letter of December 1, 1982 to

3   Dr. G.R. DiMarco regarding Nordine Study,

4   December 1, 1982. Do you recognize this?

5        A.   I do. This is a memo from Dr. Teague

6   commenting on Richard Nordine, who is in the

7   marketing department at Reynolds about this large

8   consumer study they have done, and he's writing to

9   another Reynolds scientist, a Dr. DiMarco, about the

10   implications of the findings from that study.

11         Q.   Okay. We're going to go to the bottom of

12   the first page of Exhibit 1820, the paragraph that

13   begins "thus."

14             "Thus, the total transient market for

15   cigarettes is the result of a dynamic equilibrium

16   with about as many new smokers entering it as

17   confirmed smokers leaving it. Any change at either

18   end, entry or exit of this equilibrium, will change

19   the position of the equilibrium, hence, the size of

20   the market.

21              "Therefore, we need to focus more effort

22   on adult, quote, pre-smokers and on confirmed

23   smokers who would like to stop smoking. To do this

24   we need to know much more about why some adults

25   begin to smoke, why the majority of confirmed 4564

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=226
1    smokers would like to stop smoking, why some

2   confirmed smokers are able to stop smoking and

3   others are not able, positive/negatives associated

4   with stopping smoking, state-of-the-art present

5   projected techniques for stopping smoking.

6             "However, we cannot ever be comfortable

7   selling a product which most of our customers would

8   stop using if they could. That is to say, if the

9   exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we

10   could be out of business almost overnight.

11              "Some slow but steady progress is being

12   made in developing techniques for stopping smoking,

13   but no universal method is yet in sight. The

14   probability of such a method appearing in the near

15   term is small. The probability of such a method

16   appearing over the long-term approaches 100 percent.

17              "If and when that occurs, our options

18   include, one, go out of business; two, find a way to

19   eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking; and

20   three, provide other products away from conventional

21    cigarettes which meet the same needs now met but

22   without the associated negatives."

23             Have you recently completed a study

24   relating to the desire of current smokers to quit?

25        A.   Yes. 4565

1         Q.   What does that show?

2        A.   It shows that over 90 percent of smokers

3   regret their decision to ever start smoking to begin

4   with, and that over the course of following smokers

5   for eight years, we found that 96 percent of smokers

6   have tried to quit, but most of them are still

7   smoking because they relapse back to smoking.

8             So the desire to quit is there, the

9   problem for most people is they find it hard to

10   sustain staying off cigarettes once they become

11   physiologically addicted to nicotine.

12        Q.   Exhibit 425, a pamphlet entitled "Raising

13   Kids Who Don't Smoke."

14             What is that, very briefly?

15        A.   This is a Philip Morris publication from

16   2003, and it speaks to some of the research that

17   I've done, and it also talks about how to screen for

18   nicotine dependence and what people would do if they

19   knew the health effects of smoking.

20             MR. SCAROLA: We would move 425 into

21         evidence.

22             THE COURT: It's admitted. 425.

23             (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

24        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

25        Exhibit 425.) 4566

1     BY MR. SCAROLA:

2        Q.   Again, with the very limited amount of

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=227
3   time we have, and understanding we can see it all

4   later, what are the most significant highlights on

5   this pamphlet with respect to the matters about

6   which you have been testifying?

7        A.   Well, it talks about addiction, and it

8   says that the younger people are when they start

9   smoking, the more likely it is that they are going

10   to become strongly addicted to nicotine.

11              Symptoms of addiction they talk about are

12   feeling anxious and irritable and so on. So they

13   relate those symptoms, and they can appear in teens

14   and preteens even within weeks or only days after

15   they become occasional smokers.

16        Q.   This is R.J. Reynolds?

17        A.   No, Philip Morris.

18        Q.   This is Philip Morris speaking?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   The defendant in this case.

21             What else do they tell us?

22        A.   They talk about if your children are

23   smoking for a while, you may be addicted, and ask

24   the following questions that actually give you a

25   screening tool to assess nicotine dependence. 4567

1              Have you ever tried to quit but couldn't?

2   Do you ever have strong cravings to smoke? Do you

3   have trouble concentrating, feel cranky, restless,

4   nervous, or anxious when you can't smoke? Have you

5   tried to go without smoking but failed?

6             Commenting here they say, "if you answered

7   yes to any of these questions, you may be addicted."

8        Q.   What do they tell you about talking to

9   your child?

10        A.   They say -- if you're a smoker, actually

11    they're saying if you're a smoker, how do you talk

12   to your kids about smoking?

13             They say, "Talk about why you started to

14   smoke. Don't be afraid to admit that you might have

15   made a different choice had you understood then what

16   you do now. Your child will respect your honesty."

17        Q.   What is the year of this publication?

18        A.   2003.

19        Q.   All right, sir. Let's go on to

20   Exhibit 2510. This is a press release of

21    May 16,1988. Do you recognize this document?

22        A.   I do.

23        Q.   And can you tell us, please, what this is?

24        A.   This is a press release issued right after

25   the 1988 Surgeon General's report by The Tobacco 4568

1   Institute. It names two of The Tobacco Institute

2   spokespeople, Brennan Moran and Walker Merryman, and

3   it comments on the tobacco industry's public

4   position in 1988 about cigarette smoking and

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=228
5   addiction.

6             MR. SCAROLA: We would move 2510 into

7        evidence, your Honor.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: It's already in evidence.

9        Already testified to by Dr. Burns.

10             MR. SCAROLA: I will skip it.

11              Let's go to the 1994 hearings video,

12        Exhibit 1771, please.

13             Just play it.

14             (Thereupon, a video clip was played and

15        transcribed as follows:)

16             THE HOST: Let me begin my questioning on

17        the manner of whether or not nicotine is

18        addictive. Let me ask you first, and I'd like

19        to just go down the row, whether each of you

20        believes that nicotine is not addictive. I

21         heard virtually all of you touch on it. Just

22        yes or no. Do you believe nicotine is not

23        addictive?

24             VOICE: I believe nicotine is not

25        addictive, yes. 4569

1              THE HOST: Mr. Johnston?

2             VOICE: Congressman, cigarettes and

3        nicotine clearly do not meet the classic

4        definitions of addiction. There is no

5        intoxicants --

6             THE HOST: We'll take that as no. And,

7        again, time is short. If you could just --1

8        think each of you believe nicotine is not

9        addictive, and we'd just like to have this for

10        the record.

11              VOICE: I don't believe that nicotine or

12        our products are addictive.

13             VOICE: I believe nicotine is not

14        addictive.

15             VOICE: I believe that nicotine is not

16        addictive.

17             VOICE: I believe that nicotine is not

18        addictive.

19             VOICE: And I, too, believe that nicotine

20        is not addictive.

21              (Thereupon, the video clip ended.)

22     BY MR. SCAROLA:

23        Q.   Who were those people?

24        A.   Those -- that was the congressional

25   hearing in April 1994. They were the executives for 4570

1   major cigarette companies, R.J. Reynolds and Philip

2   Morris, as well as the other manufacturers who

3   appeared and gave sworn testimony to Congress and

4   were asked a variety of questions. And that's what

5   we saw.

6        Q.   And the year of that was 1994?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=229
7        A.   That's correct.

8        Q.   Let's go back in time, 14 years earlier.

9   Exhibit 2184. Do you recognize that document?

10        A.   Yes.

11         Q.   What is it?

12        A.   This is a memorandum from The Tobacco

13   Institute from Mr. Kloepfer, who was the editor of

14   one of the publications distributed by The Tobacco

15   Institute to the vice president of The Tobacco

16   Institute, William Kloepfer. And the date of the

17   document is September 9th, 1980.

18             MR. SCAROLA: I would move the document

19        into evidence.

20             THE COURT: What about 1771?

21              MR. SCAROLA: I would move that into

22        evidence, your Honor.

23             THE COURT: Admitted. 24

25 4571

1              (Thereupon, the referred-to document was

2        marked by the Clerk in evidence as Plaintiff

3        Exhibit 2184 and 1771.)

4             THE COURT: All right. Counsel can

5        approach.

6             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

7        held out of the presence of the jury:)

8             THE COURT: This has to be the last

9        question. This has to be the last question.

10        It's 5:20. I've really extended it. We have

11         three minutes. What's the objection?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: The Shook, Hardy lawyer

13        comment about litigation issues should not be

14        used in this fashion. There was also agreement

15        regarding redaction that has not been followed

16        with respect to this particular document. I

17        don't think the second page should be used. If

18        he wants to use the first page, that's fine.

19             THE COURT: Second page. He can't read

20        the second page. The second page is not

21         admitted.

22             MR. SCAROLA: I don't think this has gone

23        in.

24             THE COURT: This has not gone in. So you

25        are not objecting to the first page, but you're 4572

1         objecting to the second page. The second page

2        is not coming in, and the first page is coming

3        in.

4             And we need to conclude at 5:20.

5             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

6        concluded and the following proceedings were

7        held within the presence of the jury:)

8             MR. SCAROLA: First page is going in?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=230
9             THE COURT: First page.

10             MR. SCAROLA: That's fine.

11              Your Honor, with the understanding that

12        that has been admitted, I will move on, and I

13        would offer into evidence the following

14        documents: Exhibit 4060, Exhibit 2275 --

15             THE CLERK: Counselor, slow down.

16             MR. SCAROLA: 4060,2275,2231,2380,

17        2606,3888.

18             THE COURT: 3888. Okay. From defense, do

19        any of those fall into your special categories?

20             MS. KESSLER: I need a minute.

21              THE COURT: I want to be clear, 2184, even

22        the first page is subject to the same?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor.

24             MR. SCAROLA: I would also move into

25        evidence --4573

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm sorry. Some of these

2        were not designated with this witness. I don't

3        have it here.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I would be happy to deal

5        with those first thing in the morning.

6             THE COURT: Defense has no objection to

7        counsel not doing it on direct?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: If he's moving documents

9        into evidence, if that's all he's doing.

10             MR. SCAROLA: I would just be moving them

11         into evidence at this point.

12             THE COURT: Which other ones? You were

13        about to name another one, I think, after 3888.

14             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, I was.  1166 and 113.

15        Those are Philip Morris annual reports from

16         1956 and 1957.

17             THE COURT: Okay. The Court is going to

18        reserve on those.

19             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

20     BY MR. SCAROLA:

21         Q.   Just one quick last series of questions.

22             Can I have the ELMO, please.

23             You saw these questions before. I want to

24   get your answers to them, and we'll go through them

25   very quickly. 4574

1             Was Charlie Piendle addicted to nicotine

2   in cigarettes made and sold by RJR and Philip

3   Morris?

4             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is cumulative

5        and argumentative at this point.

6             MR. SCAROLA: The questions have not been

7        directly answered, your Honor, and all I am

8        doing is going through these, getting a yes or

9        no response, and I will conclude my

10        examination.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=231
11              THE COURT: Overruled.

12        A.   Yes.

13     BY MR. SCAROLA:

14        Q.   Was that addiction a substantial

15   contributing cause of Charlie's death, understanding

16   that the defendants concede that Charlie died of

17   lung cancer caused by smoking?

18        A.   Yes, it was.

19        Q.   Was the tobacco industry in general, and

20   these defendants in particular significantly

21    contributing to starting Charlie's addiction?

22        A.   Yes, they were.

23        Q.   Keeping him smoking?

24        A.   Yes, they were.

25        Q.   Making it more difficult for him to quit? 4575

1        A.   Yes, they did.

2        Q.   Did the defendants engage in the kind of

3   conduct as follows: Were young people like Charlie

4   specifically targeted by the tobacco industry?

5        A.   Yes, they were.

6        Q.   What did the industry know about the

7   health hazards of smoking while targeting youth, did

8   they know that smoking was hazardous to health?

9        A.   They did know that it was hazardous to

10   health and caused cancer.

11         Q.   What did the industry know about the

12   powerful addictive properties of nicotine while

13   targeting youth, did they know that nicotine was

14   powerfully addictive?

15        A.   Yes, they knew that was the primary reason

16   people continued to smoke.

17        Q.   Did the industry intentionally conceal

18   knowledge and/or purposely create uncertainty about

19   the health hazards of smoking while Charlie smoked?

20        A.   Yes, through a nearly 50-year planful,

21    well-executed, highly-financed campaign, they did

22   that.

23        Q.   Did the industry intentionally conceal

24   knowledge and/or purposely create uncertainty about

25   the strength of smoking addiction while Charlie 4576

1    smoked?

2        A.   Yes, they denied that smoking was

3   addictive, nicotine was addictive.

4        Q.   Did the industry not only withhold

5   information but also actively mislead public

6   health -- public health officials and the general

7   public?

8        A.   Yes, they did.

9        Q.   Last four.

10             Have you told us whether, how, and for how

11    long individual tobacco companies worked together to

12   maximize profits in conscious disregard of Charlie

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=232
13   Piendle's welfare?

14        A.   Yes, the jointly funded organizations, the

15   Tobacco Industry Research Committee and The Tobacco

16   Institute were initiated in the early 1950s, 1954

17   through 1998.

18        Q.   And can you tell us, please, whether

19   cigarette design was manipulated to deceive Charlie

20   Piendle and the general public?

21         A.   Yes, cigarette design was specifically

22   intended to keep people addicted to cigarettes and

23   maximize their satisfaction specifically with

24   regards to nicotine delivery.

25        Q.   Were they then specifically designed and 4577

1   manipulated to maximize the addictive hold of

2   smoking on Charlie Piendle, while Charlie was a

3   smoker?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   How long did the cover up last?

6        A.   Well, between 1954 and 1998, and actually

7   the companies -- these defendants did not change

8   their opinion on smoking and health until November

9   of 2000.

10             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much, Doctor.

11              THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

12        we will conclude for the evening, and that

13        concludes the direct examination by the

14        plaintiff, and we'll resume tomorrow morning

15        with the cross-examination by --

16             Who will go first?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: R.J.Reynolds.

18             THE COURT: --R.J.Reynolds. We will

19        resume tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning. So we

20        look forward to seeing you, with the same

21         instruction this evening, not to discuss your

22        testimony with anyone, not to view any media,

23        no research.

24             Remind our witness you remain under oath,

25        not to discuss the case or your testimony with 4578

1         anyone.

2             Everyone have a good evening. We'll see

3        you back tomorrow morning. Gina wanted me to

4        remind you to sign in in the morning before you

5        come up at 9:30. Thank you.

6             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

7        after which the following proceedings were

8        held:)

9             THE COURT: Okay. We'll resume tomorrow

10        morning at 9:30.

11              MR. HENK: Can we be heard?

12             THE COURT: We're ready to conclude.

13             MR. HENK: I'm trying to respect

14        your Honor's instruction earlier --

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=233
15             MR. SCAROLA: We will waive any delay in

16        making those arguments, your Honor.

17             THE COURT: What is the anticipated time

18        for the cross-examination?

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'll give you a better

20        estimate in the morning, but I think my earlier

21         estimate of three to four was probably on the

22        short, your Honor. The witness went much

23        longer than I anticipated.

24             THE COURT: To the extent you're getting

25        to a witness tomorrow, have you identified who 4579

1        that witness is?

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: We have. It would be

3        Dr. Riddel, if we get to her. I would very

4        much like to get to her. I think her direct

5        will be relatively short. I have every desire

6        to get her on and off the stand tomorrow, but I

7        don't know if we'll be able to do that.

8             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I think if

9        defense were to address what they anticipate

10        the total length of their case to be, it would

11         relieve any concern your Honor might have about

12        our not being on schedule because I think we

13        are.

14             THE COURT: Let's see, I have my notes.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I suspect that maybe the

16        representations at the beginning of the case

17        might have been modified by now, it's only a

18        guess on my part, but perhaps they could tell

19        us.

20             THE COURT: Well, has the defense made any

21         changes to what you had originally?

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: We need to confer about

23        that. We have not had an opportunity to do

24        that. The defense case will go in the time we

25        had suggested to your Honor, I am confident, I 4580

1        think it will likely be shorter than that, but

2        again we need to confer and talk about it. We

3        have not had an opportunity to do that.

4             MR. HENK: Your Honor, we may have to call

5        back witnesses in our case in chief in part

6        over plaintiffs counsels' refusal to stipulate

7        as to the dates of depositions and the dates of

8        interrogatory responses. I tried to get a

9        stipulation. They have refused to stipulate to

10        dates of events that occurred. So we may have

11         to confer internally.

12             THE COURT: Confer internally and then

13        confer with the opposing side before you bring

14        it to the Court's attention.

15             MR. SCAROLA: To the extent that the date

16        of any event may be relevant, material, and

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=234
17        admissible, it will not be necessary to call a

18        witness to establish what the record reflects.

19             MR. SALES: We just don't want them

20        putting it in in our case.

21              THE COURT: If defense would confer, it

22        would be helpful tomorrow to get, if there is a

23        revised or at least updated sequence of who

24        you're calling perhaps and when you're calling

25        and importantly who you're calling and time 4581

1         allotted for that.

2             MR. KELLY: Absolutely.

3             THE COURT: See you tomorrow morning at

4        9:30. Have a good evening.

5             (Thereupon, the proceedings concluded for

6        the day at 5:29 p.m., and will continue in

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=238
15        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

16        A.   Good morning.

17        Q.   In the past, sir, you have described

18   yourself as anti-tobacco, have you not?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   In fact, you wrote an article entitled

21    "The War on Tobacco," true?

22        A.   That's true.

23        Q.   And you have been referred to, at least by

24   the local paper up in Buffalo, as General Cummings,

25   right? 4868

1        A.   I guess I've been at it for a while.

2        Q.   As in the general on the war on tobacco,

3   right?

4        A.   They did use that title in an article that

5   characterized some of my work over the last 30

6   years.

7        Q.   You have spoken to thousands of people

8   about your war against tobacco in various settings;

9   isn't that true?

10        A.   Many thousands, yes.

11         Q.   And you have even advocated the banning of

12   cigarettes altogether.

13        A.   Combustion tobacco products, or taking the

14   nicotine out.

15        Q.   In fact, haven't you written that we are

16   50 years too late in terms of banning tobacco

17   combustion products after the Surgeon General's

18   reports came out in 1964?

19        A.   I think what I said is combustion tobacco

20   products that have nicotine.

21         Q.   You have also advocated thinking

22   creatively about ways to make the tobacco industry

23   less profitable, correct?

24        A.   That's correct.

25        Q.   And eliminating the profitability of the 4869

1   tobacco business altogether, true?

2        A.   That's right.

3        Q.   One way to make cigarette companies less

4   profitable would be to encourage them to sell

5   nicotine-replacement products like the nicotine gum

6   or the nicotine patch, true?

7        A.   I don't think that would make them less

8   profitable. It would make them more profitable,

9   since most customers would leave smoking if they

10   could.

11         Q.   You think that would be a good thing?

12        A.   Yes, absolutely.

13        Q.   Do you know whether or not an affiliate of

14   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has purchased a

15   Swedish company called Niconovum or an interest in

16   it, that makes alternative nicotine delivery systems

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=239
17   like gum and patches?

18        A.   And smokeless products. Yes, I am

19   familiar with that. They also run a company called

20   Targacept. I think a former research director, Don

21    DeBethizy, is the executive of that company. I'm

22   familiar with that.

23        Q.   And you would regard Targacept, the

24   interest that an affiliate has in Niconovum, the

25   nicotine replacement company, as well as the 4870

1   marketing of smokeless tobacco products such as

2   Snus, right, as a good thing, wouldn't you?

3        A.   Well, I think Snus has a lot of problems,

4   particularly when there are much cleaner delivery

5   systems for nicotine, such as gum and lozenge, that

6   would be the preference, but certainly better than

7   selling cigarettes.

8        Q.   Okay. You have identified another

9   strategy for eliminating or reducing the

10   profitability of the tobacco business, and that is

11    to increase the cost of doing business by a

12   regulation in litigation, true?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And plaintiffs lawyers are involved at

15   least in part in that strategy, right?

16        A.   They are.

17        Q.   Plaintiffs expert witnesses like yourself

18   are also involved in that strategy?

19        A.   I've been asked to serve as an expert

20   witness and have been doing it for about 15 years.

21         Q.   Would you agree that you have a fairly

22   significant anti-tobacco bias on the issues in this

23   case?

24        A.   Well, I wouldn't call it a bias. I come

25   in and give truthful testimony about what I know 4871

1    about the effects of smoking, nicotine dependence,

2   my study of the business records, the research that

3   I've done on the products, the marketing. So what I

4   do is I come in and give truthful testimony.

5        Q.   You have taken your war against tobacco

6   into the courtroom, haven't you?

7        A.   I have served as an expert witness, yes.

8        Q.   Okay. And you have testified under oath

9   against tobacco companies more than 50 times?

10        A.   Yes. I've never been asked by a cigarette

11    company to come in and testify on their behalf.

12        Q.   Do you think it could be as many as a

13   hundred times?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   Somewhere between 50 and a hundred?

16        A.   It's about 50 times maybe, maybe more. I

17   haven't counted it all.

18        Q.   So many times you lost track of the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=240
19   number?

20        A.   I just don't bother to count them up.

21    I've been doing this for 15 years, and when you say

22   testify, it includes deposition and trial testimony.

23   I've done about, you know, 25 trials or so.

24        Q.   About 25 trials?

25        A.   Yeah. 4872

1         Q.   In fact, isn't it true that in the last

2   year alone, since I think roughly April of 2009, you

3   have testified in ten or more trials like this?

4        A.   No, not ten. I've done --1 think since

5   March, there were six trials that I've done.

6        Q.   Since March of 2009?

7        A.   2010.

8        Q.   2010. My question was 2009.

9        A.   Sorry.

10        Q.   Would you agree with me it's at least ten

11    times --

12        A.   Yeah.

13        Q.    since April -- let me finish the

14   question, I'm sorry -- since April of 2009?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   All right. Thank you.

17        A.   That's probably about right.

18        Q.   And a whole bunch of those trials have

19   been down here in Florida, right?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   Not limited to tobacco litigation, you

22   have been retained as an expert by plaintiffs

23   lawyers in more than 100 lawsuits throughout your

24   career?

25        A.   That, I don't know. I think I've been 4873

1   listed because I did a generic testimony here in

2   Florida on a lot of cases, and I've given my

3   permission for my generic testimony to be played.

4        Q.   I think you testified on direct

5   examination with Mr. Scarola that you charge $300

6   per hour for time that you spend testifying either

7   in a trial like this one or in deposition; is that

8   right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And $100 an hour in order to review

11    materials and to prepare your testimony?

12        A.   That's correct.

13        Q.   And that includes payment for your travel

14   time?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   Isn't it true that about more than half of

17   the money that you receive as a result of your

18   litigation work goes to you?

19        A.   That's right. Half of it goes to Roswell,

20   I've set up an account there. It goes to our

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=241
21    Roswell Park Alliance, which is our fundraising

22   organization for our cancer center.

23        Q.   And I think you mentioned to Mr. Scarola

24   on direct examination that 20 percent of your time

25   nowadays is devoted to tobacco litigation issues, is 4874

1   that -- did I remember that correctly?

2        A.   Right, in 2010, because there had been

3   this whole host of cases that sort of came up. And

4   since March, I've done six trials. I think this is

5   the seventh trial.

6        Q.   And I don't know if I heard it or not, but

7   would you -- what percentage of your income would

8   that 20 percent of the time nowadays represent?

9        A.   Well, my income is 180,000 a year. I'm a

10   senior scientist, been at Roswell 30 years. So

11    that's my salary at Roswell. So it's about

12   20 percent of that.

13        Q.   So Roswell pays you at approximately the

14   same rate that you charge when you testify in

15   litigation and prepare for litigation?

16        A.   Yeah. Roughly. My fees are pretty much

17   set to the fees that I charge for consulting.

18        Q.   Okay. You were a participant in a

19   workshop in media training conducted, I think, by an

20   outfit called The Advocacy Institute back in, I

21    think, 1988.

22        A.   I attended a conference at the National

23   Cancer Institute, and The Advocacy Institute I think

24   helped organize that for the National Cancer

25   Institute. 4875

1         Q.   Okay. And the workshop brought together

2   experts like yourself in order to discuss how to

3   frame issues concerning smoking and health; is that

4   fair?

5        A.   It was basically to talk about how to give

6   interviews, because The Tobacco Institute used

7   professionals to do interviews, and doctors and

8   scientists were no match really for the experts in

9   public relations. So really what they did is

10   brought in some people who were expert in public

11    relations and talked and gave advice on how to teach

12   people to do these interviews.

13        Q.   And that training would have applicability

14   in courtrooms too in terms of helping you respond to

15   questions that may get asked here.

16        A.   No. I mean, it was about doing media

17   interviews, I think it was about media advocacy,

18   which was just a way of talking about public

19   relations activities to try to get the word out

20   about the dangers of smoking.

21         Q.   Uh-huh. The workshop also covered a topic

22   called creating a controversy, didn't it?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=242
23        A.   It was back in the '80s, there was a

24   booklet that was produced based on the proceedings

25   of that meeting. It might have. 4876

1         Q.   Well, let me see if I can read an excerpt

2   to you and see if it refreshes your recollection.

3        A.   Sure.

4        Q.   Do you recall that according to the

5   workshop --

6             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. I

7        object to reading from a document that has not

8        been marked and is not an exhibit in evidence.

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: I mean, I can show him

10        the transcript of his own prior testimony if

11         that helps.

12             MR. SCAROLA: All I am requesting

13        your Honor, is that the rule of evidence be

14        complied with, and that prohibits reading from

15        a document that has not been marked and not

16        been admitted.

17             It may be, when we see it, that if it's

18        properly listed and it's relevant and material,

19        we'll have no objection. I'm only asking that

20        the rules be complied with.

21              THE COURT: Do you have a transcript to

22        refresh the witness' recollection?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor.

24             THE COURT: So is there something you want

25        to show him? 4877

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, I'd like to have the

2        Gray transcript from January 26th, 2010, in the

3        afternoon.

4             THE COURT: All right. Why don't we give

5        that to the witness then.

6             MR. SCAROLA: May I also request of

7        counsel that we have a copy?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, absolutely. I will

9        do it every time. It just takes me a minute.

10             May I approach?

11              THE COURT: Yes.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, would you

13        like a copy?

14             THE COURT: Yes.

15     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

16        Q.   And let me give you the page. It would be

17   page 1116. And if I could direct your attention to

18   line 7 to 19.

19        A.   Of course.

20        Q.   Now, if you could just read that question,

21    Doctor, to yourself, and then I'll ask a question

22   when you are finished.

23        A.   Okay. I've read it.

24        Q.   Do you recall that one of the topics

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=243
25   covered in The Advocacy Institute's seminar in 1988 4878

1   was creating controversy?

2        A.   Well, it was a workshop, and -- yeah.

3        Q.   Okay. And one of the examples that was

4   discussed about how to create a controversy would be

5   to, for example, film -- send kids into convenience

6   stores and film them when they're underage buying

7   cigarettes, right?

8        A.   That's right. Back at the time that that

9   conference was held, just about anybody could go

10   into a store and buy cigarettes. So they talked

11    about doing that, and they said, well, because of

12   the media aspect of it, perhaps you could actually

13   film it, the kids going in and buying the

14   cigarettes, to show how easy it was for underage

15   individuals to get cigarettes.

16        Q.   Right. And to make it newsworthy and to

17   gain publicity, right?

18        A.   Yes. I mean, to get the message out and,

19   essentially, the message then was, why aren't we

20   enforcing the laws about minors' access to

21    cigarettes. It was quite effective in changing the

22   behavior of retailers, actually, so they are less

23   likely today to sell cigarettes to minors.

24        Q.   Now, you actually put creating controversy

25   into practice, haven't you? 4879

1        A.   Yeah. I actually have done some of these

2   studies in the Buffalo area about sending kids into

3   stores to document how easy it was for kids to buy

4   cigarettes, and we did have a film crew at one point

5   go along with the police officer from the local

6   community as they went around, and I think my son at

7   the time was 12, and went in and was mic'd up to

8   hear the interaction between the clerk and him, and

9   he was able to buy cigarettes, I think, in nine out

10   of ten of the stores.

11         Q.I actually have a somewhat different

12   example in mind. You discussed with the jury

13   yesterday Plaintiffs Exhibit 1433, which was a

14   letter in 1990 from Reynolds to Willow Park

15   Elementary School in Amherst, New York.

16        A.   Willow Ridge.

17        Q.   Willow Ridge, excuse me. I'd like to talk

18   to you a little bit about that.

19        A.   Sure.

20        Q.   That Willow Ridge is -- the school, the

21    elementary school is located in a suburb near

22   Buffalo where you live, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   As I recall, in 1990, a nurse invited you

25   to come give a lecture to the fifth graders at the 4880

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=244
1    elementary school, right?

2        A.   Yes, Beth Shipe.

3        Q.   And you're the one who encouraged the

4   students to write a letter to the tobacco companies?

5        A.   Actually, I asked the teacher when I went

6   in what were the students learning at the time, and

7   she told me that they were learning how to write

8   business letters. So I suggested writing the

9   business letters to the cigarette companies about

10   the brand logos that appeared on toys and candy

11   products and video games at the time, and the

12   students did that because my lecture had talked

13   about the health effects of smoking and some of the

14   marketing of tobacco products, and I lectured to

15   that school because I was invited in, and I do many

16   schools in the area because I work at a cancer

17   center, and that's one of the services that our

18   center provides to the local community.

19        Q.   Okay. So the answer is, you encouraged or

20   suggested that the students write to the tobacco

21    companies?

22        A.   I did.

23        Q.   Let's take this in bite size. The letters

24   were sent to all tobacco companies, not just my

25   client, R.J. Reynolds, right? 4881

1        A.   I don't know.

2        Q.   You do know that R.J. Reynolds is the only

3   company that gave the courtesy of a response?

4        A.   That's correct.

5        Q.   And the response was to the principal of

6   the school, not directly to the students, right?

7        A.   It was.

8        Q.   And the nurse gave you a copy of a letter

9   that had been sent to the principal, right?

10        A.   That's correct.

11         Q.   And now you use it as an exhibit in trials

12   all around the country, right?

13        A.   Well, it's --1 do, and I certainly

14   brought it along as an exhibit. It was never

15   intended to be an exhibit. I mean, I had no clue

16   that I would ever be an expert witness in a tobacco

17   case in 1990 when I had gone in to talk to the fifth

18   graders and received the call from the nurse about

19   the letter.

20        Q.   I think, as you said, the fifth graders

21    were learning how to write business letters as part

22   of their classwork, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And one of the things that you suggested

25   that they write to the tobacco companies about was 4882

1   the use of logos or trademarks on toys and candy

2   cigarettes, right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=245
3        A.   And video games.

4        Q.   And video games, okay. Is trademark

5   infringement a topic that you learned about in the

6   fifth grade?

7        A.   No.

8        Q.   Okay. In fact, R.J. Reynolds has never

9   sold candy cigarettes, has it?

10        A.   No.

11         Q.   Never sold toys?

12        A.   No.

13        Q.   Never sold video games?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   From your research, you know, don't you,

16   that Reynolds has had a consistent policy against

17   the use of its trademarks on products directed to

18   children, such as toys, video games, and candy?

19        A.   Well, all I know is that, at the time, I

20   had pictures of toys, candy tobacco products, and

21    video games that had logos for Reynolds products, as

22   well as Philip Morris products, and I shared those

23   with the students and this was the letter that came

24   back.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that sometimes manufacturers 4883

1    of products, such as candy or toys, will use the

2   trademark of one of the tobacco companies without

3   permission?

4        A.   I don't know how it happens, but you go to

5   the toy aisle and it was very common to see toys,

6   motorcycles with Camel logos on it, racecars with

7   Marlboro logos, Atari Grand Prix racing had images

8   of Marlboro in it. I have, in the past, written

9   letters to the companies to alert them to the fact

10   that their logos were showing up in these games and

11    on products that are aimed at children.

12        Q.   During your review of the historical

13   documents that you talk about and that you have seen

14   during the course of your testimony in cases like

15   this one, isn't it true that Reynolds' in-house

16   lawyers will contact the manufacturers of children's

17   products to demand that they stop using Reynolds'

18   trademarks on candy and toys and video games

19   intended for kids?

20        A.   I have seen those, yeah.

21         Q.   You have seen those?

22        A.   Yeah.

23        Q.   Okay. Are you aware that Reynolds has

24   gone so far as to sue manufacturers of children's

25   products who use their trademarks, Reynolds' 4884

1   trademarks on products for children?

2        A.   I'm not familiar with that.

3        Q.   That's not something you investigated?

4        A.   I'm not familiar with any lawsuits. I'd

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=246
5   be happy to come in and testify on your behalf. I

6   think it's wrong that they use their trademarks on

7   toys, candy products, and video games.

8        Q.   Would you dispute that R.J. Reynolds

9   Tobacco Company actively seeks to prevent candy

10   cigarette manufacturers from using Reynolds'

11    trademarks, for example?

12             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. May

13        we have a time frame for this question?

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Certainly. The 1980s, and certainly at

16   the time that the letter was written from Willow

17   Ridge Elementary School in 1990.

18        A.   In 1990, I'm familiar with responses I've

19   gotten back when I've written to the companies that

20   they would go up and ask the owner of the store to

21    remove --1 think it was Atari Grand Prix racing,

22   which was at a children's mini golf -- miniature

23   golf setup where they had the games, and I had taken

24   down the serial number and they said they would

25   remove the logos on that machine and any other 4885

1   machine that I would locate, one by one.

2        Q.   Now, let's go back to the exhibit that you

3   used with the jury. Let me get the number right, PT

4    1433. That letter was dated, as I recall,

5   January 11th, 1990, right?

6        A.   That's right.

7        Q.   At that time, Mr. Piendle would have been

8   how old?

9        A.   He was dead at that point.

10        Q.   1990? Are you sure about that?

11         A.   No, I'm sorry. He had quit smoking in

12    1989, so he was born in 1941, so he would have

13   been --

14        Q.   48 or 49 years old?

15        A.   Right.

16        Q.   And as you point out, he hadn't quit

17   smoking by that point, right?

18        A.   That's right. He quit in'89.

19        Q.   Now, you showed the jury the first

20   paragraph of the letter after you suggested --

21    relating to your suggestion that the students write

22   to the company about logos that were appearing on

23   candy cigarettes and other products, but there's

24   another paragraph that I'd like to draw to your

25   attention. 4886

1        A.   Sure.

2        Q.   And if we look at the first -- the second

3   paragraph here, and I'll just read it. "As

4   information, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's policy

5   is not to allow our brand names to be used on toys

6   or candy cigarettes, and any current use of our

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=247
7   brand names in this fashion is not sanctioned by our

8   company." You did not read that portion of the

9   letter to the jury, did you?

10        A.   No, I did not read that portion.

11         Q.   And the next paragraph, third paragraph,

12   "Advise the principal of the school that the tobacco

13   industry considers smoking to be a custom for those

14   adults who drive pleasure from it." You see that?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   You didn't read that to the jury either,

17   did you?

18        A.   No.

19        Q.   In Reynolds' response, you read the

20   portion that noted that some of the students also

21    commented about the controversies surrounding

22   cigarette smoking. Do you remember reading that a

23   bit?

24        A.   Some of the students?

25        Q.   Yes, some of the Reynolds' letters said, 4887

1    and some of the students raised in their letters to

2   the company the controversy surrounding cigarette

3   smoking. Do you remember reading that sentence?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   Is that another topic that you suggested

6   students mention in their letter?

7        A.   No.

8        Q.   You told them about smoking and health,

9   didn't you, during the course of your presentation

10   to them?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   Did you tell them about the tobacco

13   industry's position on smoking and health in your

14   letter to them -- in your discussions to them?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And then you suggested that they write a

17   letter to the tobacco companies?

18        A.   Actually, I suggested it to the teacher.

19        Q.   You suggested it to the teacher, fine,

20   thanks.

21              Isn't it true that there are about

22   60 million pages of tobacco company internal

23   documents that are publicly available today?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   And I think you said that you have about 4888

1    16 million pages of those tobacco industry documents

2   at your Roswell Park facility; did I get that right?

3        A.   No.

4        Q.   No, okay. How many --1 thought you

5   received 16 million pages of documents relating to

6   CTR and TIRC and TI?

7        A.   No. I received the holdings from the

8   Council for Tobacco Research and The Tobacco

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=248
9   Institute that amounted to 16 million pages, plus

10   about 3,000 videotapes and audiotapes, but at our

11    institution, we have a server, we have all

12   60 million pages that we run on a server that is

13   available publicly.

14             We designed some ways for people to be

15   able to search the documents more easily across all

16   of the companies and all of the material, like going

17   to a library, and I have hired librarians to come in

18   and educate me about how to literally create a

19   virtual card catalog, making it possible to do the

20   searching on the documents.

21             We OCR'd, optical scan recognition, the

22   documents so keywords can be identified. So if you

23   type in a word like "Marlboro" or "Camel" or

24   whatever, it would bring up all the materials with

25   that word on the scanned documents. So it 4889

1   facilitates the searching process, and that's on the

2   servers at Roswell.

3        Q.   It could be on servers elsewhere too,

4   right?

5        A.   I think University of California,

6   San Francisco and, of course, the companies have put

7   their individual files up online as well and have

8   their own servers.

9        Q.   Isn't it true that you received over

10   $9 million in order to digitize and to research the

11    16 million pages of documents that you received?

12        A.   No, I don't think it's been that much, but

13   I did receive four or five grants that facilitated

14   not only the digitizing of the material and

15   organizing and indexing, but also research based on

16   the documents, and I'm not sure if it totals

17   9 million. I don't think it's 9 million.

18        Q.   You wouldn't dispute that it's millions,

19   would you?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   And certain of the documents that you

22   reviewed as part of that process are used in your

23   testimony with the court, like you used here, right?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   A portion of the money you received in 4890

1    order to digitize and research these documents came

2   from an outfit called the American Legacy Foundation

3   for tobacco document collections through an access

4   of scanning the documents, using the database?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   And that foundation helped provide you

7   resources to do the -- or to create digital images

8   of the documents and to research some of the

9    16 million that you have received, right?

10        A.   That's correct.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=249
11         Q.   Now, the American Legacy Foundation

12   found -- funds, rather, antismoking and

13   anticigarette advertising campaigns, doesn't it?

14        A.   Right. They were created as part of the

15   master settlement to do that.

16        Q.   In fact, one of the ads that the American

17   Legacy Foundation created was one where a truckful

18   of body bags pulls up in front of Philip Morris'

19   headquarters and they start dumping the bodies out

20   on the sidewalk, right?

21         A.   Part of the truth campaign.

22        Q.   Part of the truth campaign.

23             Now, you were also provided resources in

24   order to do your document review and digitizing work

25   from an organization called the Flight Attendant 4891

1   Medical Research Institute, FAMRI?

2        A.   FAMRI, yes.

3        Q.   And FAMRI was something that was created

4   as a result of a class action suit called Broin,

5   right?

6        A.   That's correct.

7        Q.   And it was brought on behalf -- that suit

8   had been brought on behalf of flight attendants,

9   right?

10        A.   That's right, for secondhand smoke

11    exposure.

12        Q.   And you were on FAMRI's medical advisory

13   board for a time, right?

14        A.   I was, for about five years.

15        Q.   And, in fact, you talked, I think, in

16   response to Mr. Scarola about how you had testified

17   in some cases for free, you didn't charge, right?

18        A.   That's right.

19        Q.   And the case on behalf of the flight

20   attendants was one of those cases, right?

21         A.   It was.

22        Q.   In addition to testifying, you have also

23   appeared at seminars as a resource to attorneys who

24   are learning how to sue the tobacco industry, true?

25        A.   I've given lectures to many groups, 4892

1    attorneys, prisoners in prison, to school children,

2   to anyone who will listen.

3        Q.   For example, you participated in a

4   conference in Boston in 2002, didn't you?

5        A.   I did. I was invited by

6   Professor Daynard, who is a law professor at

7   Northeastern University to give talks on some of the

8   document collections that had come to Roswell Park.

9        Q.   The purpose of the conference was for

10   plaintiffs' lawyers to learn how to win lawsuits

11    against tobacco companies, wasn't it?

12        A.   Yes, the purpose, it was primarily for

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=250
13   lawyers learning about the litigation that was going

14   on against the tobacco companies.

15        Q.   In fact, Doctor, wasn't the title of the

16   conference, "How to Win a Just Tobacco Verdict"?

17        A.   I believe that was the title.

18        Q.   Okay. And by "just tobacco verdict," at

19   least in the eyes of the people who participated,

20   that would be a plaintiffs verdict, true?

21         A.   Yes, I would --1 would say that.

22        Q.   And the conference up in Boston wasn't

23   open to just any attorney, was it?

24        A.   No, it was open to anybody who was willing

25   to sign the agreement to come to the conference. 4893

1         Q.   All right. Well, let's talk about that

2   for a minute. The conference was for plaintiffs'

3   attorneys and for witnesses working with plaintiffs'

4   attorneys, wasn't it?

5        A.   I don't believe it was for witnesses. I

6   was asked to come give a talk. It was primarily for

7   law students and attorneys to come learn about the

8   litigation activities going on.

9        Q.   To attend the conference, isn't it true

10   that you had to sign an affidavit stating that you

11    did not and would not work for a tobacco company in

12   litigation?

13        A.   Right. So anybody could go, you could

14   have gone, you could have signed that affidavit.

15        Q.   Okay. Let's switch gears for a minute and

16   talk about nicotine.

17        A.   Sure.

18        Q.   You would agree it has been known for

19   literally hundreds of years that cigarette smoking

20   can be difficult to quit, wouldn't you?

21         A.   I think smokers figure it out after they

22   try to quit and find that it's hard to quit, and I

23   would say that's probably been known for a lot of

24   years.

25        Q.   You don't disagree with the notion that 4894

1   it's been known for hundreds of years that once you

2   start smoking, it could be hard to quit, right?

3        A.   No. Hundreds of years, I'm not sure about

4   that. I mean, really, the inhalable cigarette

5   really didn't come about until the early 1900s.

6        Q.   A long time, Doctor?

7        A.   A long time, I'll agree with that. I'll

8   give you that.

9        Q.   Since before Mr. Piendle started smoking

10   in the 1950s?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   In fact, even -- well, before the 1964

13   Surgeon General's report, isn't it true that

14   laypeople used to describe smoking as an addiction

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=251
15   or addictive?

16        A.   Yes, I've seen reference to smoking talked

17   about as an addiction.

18        Q.   You have seen the Florida Health Notes,

19   which was a publication of the Florida Board of

20   Health in at least the trials; have you not?

21         A.   Primarily at trials.

22        Q.   And isn't it true that in 1906 --1 can

23   show you the document. If you need it, let me know.

24   In 1906, the Florida State Board of Health

25   determined that, "Today, the cigarette is looked 4895

1   upon by all smokers" --

2             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor.

3        Again, a document should not be read from

4        unless and until it's properly marked,

5        identified, shown to opposing counsel, and

6        admitted into evidence.

7             THE COURT: Is there a document you would

8        like to show?

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: If the witness can

10        remember. It's going to slow this down if I

11         have to get it out every time and he has got,

12        as you can see, a fairly good command of his

13        materials.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry.

15             THE COURT: Can you ask the question

16        without referring to the content of the

17        document first?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sure.

19     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

20        Q.   You're familiar with the publication of

21    the Florida State Board of Health called Florida

22   Health Notes from 1906, you've seen it, correct?

23        A.   I've seen it, but it would be useful to

24   have for my recollection.

25        Q.   Let me just give you a copy of defense 4896

1   AHL32.

2             If I may approach, your Honor. Would

3   your Honor like a copy?

4             THE COURT: That's okay.

5        A.   Thank you.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. This

7        is just two pages from a very lengthy document,

8        and I would like, if counsel has it available

9        and is intending to offer any portion of it

10        into evidence, I would like to see the entire

11         document.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm just going to ask him

13        a question.

14             THE COURT: I don't think it needs to come

15        into evidence now, but let's hear what the next

16        question is first.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=252
17     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

18        Q.   Doctor, can you look at the second page of

19   this exhibit, which I think is numbered ten at the

20   top?

21         A.   Sure.

22        Q.   Okay. And let me just ask you a couple of

23   questions. You recognize this as the Florida Health

24   Notes from 1906, right?

25        A.   Yes. 4897

1         Q.   Okay. You've seen it before, yes?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Isn't it true that on page 2 of this

4   exhibit, in 1906 -

5             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

6        That's exactly what counsel cannot do. He may

7        not read from a document, nor refer to the

8        contents of a document that has not been

9        admitted into evidence.

10             THE COURT: Can you ask the question

11         without referring to the content of the

12        document?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sure.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Isn't it true that the Florida Health

16   Notes recognized --

17             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. That

18        predicate clearly is attempting to do what

19        counsel knows he is not permitted to do.

20             THE COURT: Sustained.

21      BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

22        Q.   Doctor, the State of Florida, near the

23   turn of the last century in 1906, used the term

24   "addiction" to describe --

25             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. If I 4898

1        may. A question about what somebody else said,

2        particularly where no speaker is identified,

3        calls for hearsay and secondhand knowledge

4        unless a predicate is laid for the introduction

5        through some exception to the hearsay rule of

6        that statement, that has not been done, I do

7        object.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, it's not

9        being offered for the truth of the matter

10        asserted. It goes to public awareness, the

11         fact the State of Florida said what it said in

12         1906.

13             THE COURT: Can you bring the question as

14        to what the witness' understanding of, I guess,

15        public awareness, if that's the question.

16     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

17        Q.   Isn't it true that based on the

18   information that was available in 1906, the Florida

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=253
19   State Board of Health characterized smoking --

20             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. Same

21         objection, same question.

22             THE COURT: Counsel approach.

23             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

24        held out of the presence of the jury:)

25             THE COURT: If the question is this 4899

1        witness' understanding of what public awareness

2        was, can you just frame the question that way

3        without --

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: I want to be able to

5        direct it to very specific things. This is

6        cross-examination, and I'm perfectly entitled

7        to do this. This document is not being used

8        for hearsay purposes. I think the objections

9        being asserted are ill-founded.

10             THE COURT: What is the basis for relying

11         on the document? What is --

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is just to establish

13        public awareness. You know, he was -- he was

14        able to use --

15             THE COURT: So it would be for the truth?

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: No.

17             THE COURT: That this was out or that this

18        was out in the public domain?

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, yes.

20             THE COURT: Isn't it true - are you

21         seeking to ask him, isn't it true this document

22        was in the public arena?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is true, yes.

24             THE COURT: What is the objection to that?

25             MR. SCAROLA: This is a document that is 4900

1         dated in 1906. There can be no nexus

2        established between this document and Charlie

3        Piendle. The document is hearsay unless and

4        until an appropriate predicate is laid as an

5        exception to the hearsay rule. It cannot be

6        admitted, and unless and until a predicate is

7        made or appropriate exception to the hearsay

8        rule, all of its contents should not be

9        referenced through any witness.

10             THE COURT: What is contained in it? What

11         is in the health notes? What is being argued

12        was in the public domain?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: He has already testified,

14        your Honor, that it's been known for hundreds

15        of years that smoking can be difficult to quit.

16        This is an example of -- or at least a very

17        long time. This is an example of the statement

18        in 1906 from the Florida Board of Health

19        recognizing that smoking is an addiction, okay.

20        He was able to use Tobacco Company documents

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=254
21         that talked about the importance of nicotine

22        and smoking, we objected, had no nexus to

23        Mr. Piendle.

24             THE COURT: Didn't he already testify that

25        it has been for a long time? You didn't get 4901

1        him to say a hundred years that it's been known

2        that nicotine --

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: It existed for a hundred

4        years and been a long time. I want to take him

5        back --

6             THE COURT: To impeach.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Not to impeach. I want

8        to say in 1906, the State of Florida

9        characterized cigarette smoking as an addiction

10        and it's the worst form of addiction, I believe

11         is the language. That's all I want to do. And

12        it is not -- it is not, respectfully,

13        Mr. Scarola, hearsay.

14             MR. KELLY: It's not hearsay. The only

15        foundation that needs to be laid on this

16        witness on cross-examination, is it fair when

17        you gave your testimony on direct that people

18        didn't know.

19             MR. SCAROLA: There is no predicate that

20        this document ever received any public

21         attention, any public attention, and unless and

22        until there is some predicate laid that it

23        received some public attention.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm

25        interrupting, I didn't mean to. 4902

1              MR. SCAROLA: Unless there's some

2        predicate laid that it received some public

3        attention that spilled over into the 1950s,

4        '60s, '70s, or '80s, it could not have any

5        relevance because it doesn't have any nexus.

6        Contrary to counsel's assertion, the witness

7        did not acknowledge a hundred years. What the

8        witness refused to acknowledge was that the

9        addictive properties of nicotine were

10        recognized for hundreds of years, he said since

11         the turn of the century.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me follow up. There

13        was testimony on direct examination how

14        concealment of information by the tobacco

15        industry made a huge difference to public

16        health authorities.

17             I submit, your Honor, the Florida State

18        Board of Health is one of those authorities.

19        I'm entitled to explore with the witness

20        whether or not he was aware, in 1906, they said

21         what they said.

22             THE COURT: I'm going to allow the

23        question, not the content. If on redirect you

24        want to explore whether it was public knowledge

25        or not, you can explore it on redirect. 4903

1              MR. SCAROLA: We'd like to see a copy of

2        the entire document, the entire Florida Health

3        Notes.

4             THE COURT: Do you have it?

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have it somewhere.

6             THE COURT: Before redirect?

7             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, before redirect.

8             THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

9             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

10        concluded and the following proceedings were

11         held within the presence of the jury:)

12     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

13        Q.   Doctor, when you testified yesterday about

14   the information that was available to the public

15   health community regarding addiction, were you aware

16   of the Florida Health Notes from 1906?

17        A.   I wouldn't have considered the Florida

18   Health Notes, which were referencing not something

19   from the Department of Health, but a statement from

20   somebody that got published in their notes, but I've

21    seen this only at trial brought by defendants in the

22   case. It's not something that I was aware of that

23   public health officials were utilizing as evidence.

24   It's not really evidence, it's a commentary.

25        Q.   Let me ask you, this was a publication of 4904

1   the Florida State Board of Health; was it not?

2        A.   It was contained in that Board of Health

3   statement, but it's not the evidence that I was

4   referring to as what the scientific community relied

5   on. I don't believe it's been cited in Surgeon

6   General's report or is among the 80,000 references

7   that are contained on smoking and health in the

8   Office on Smoking and Health CDC database on smoking

9   and health.

10        Q.   Simple question, Doctor: Were you aware,

11    when you gave your testimony over the course of the

12   last two days, that the Florida State Board of

13   Health, in 1906, had characterized smoking as an

14   addiction?

15        A.   I don't believe the Board of Health

16   characterized it. I believe it was an article that

17   was contained in their notes, and I've seen it only

18   at trial presented once to me, I believe.

19        Q.   In the official bulletin of the Florida

20   State Board of Health, right?

21         A.   It was in that bulletin, I believe, yes.

22        Q.   That was over a hundred years ago, right,

23    1906?

24        A.   Yes.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=256
25        Q.   The notion that -- the fact that 4905

1    cigarettes, tobacco cigarettes contain nicotine has

2   also been known for a long time, true?

3        A.   The fact that tobacco contains nicotine,

4   yes.

5        Q.   And including the tobacco in cigarettes,

6   right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Terms like "nicotine fiend" and "little

9   white slaver" date back to the early 1900s in this

10   country, don't they?

11         A.   Yes, they do.

12        Q.   You mentioned the Surgeon General's report

13   in 1988 during the course of your direct testimony,

14   remember that?

15        A.   I did. I reviewed that report, actually,

16   as one of the experts.

17        Q.   Again, I can show you an excerpt if you

18   like, but let me just ask a question, see if you're

19   able to answer it without having to review it.

20   Isn't it true that as early as the 1920s and '30s,

21    the Surgeon General's report in 1988 observed and

22   that some investigators were concluding that

23   nicotine was responsible for the compulsive use of

24   tobacco products, remember that?

25        A.   Yes, they did a review of the history of 4906

1   nicotine in tobacco, that was the subject of the

2   report.

3        Q.   Okay. Isn't it true that in the 1930s,

4   '40s, and '50s, Reader's Digest was the number one

5   publication in the country?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   And Reader's Digest went into hundreds of

8   thousands of households across the country, right?

9        A.   It did.

10        Q.   Reader's Digest published articles in the

11    1930s, '40s and '50s that identified nicotine as one

12   of the reasons that people smoke, right?

13        A.   It published a handful of articles that

14   talked about nicotine as one of the reasons that

15   people smoke, and a handful of articles on smoking

16   and health, out of the tens of thousands of articles

17   that appeared in Reader's Digest.

18        Q.   You don't dispute that Reader's Digest in

19   the 1930s, '40s and '50s sometimes referred to

20   nicotine as a drug, do you?

21         A.   No, I don't dispute that.

22        Q.   And those articles reported that people

23   could be addicted to nicotine, didn't they?

24        A.   They did say that.

25        Q.   And all these Reader's Digest articles 4907

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=257
1   weren't written for scientists, were they?

2        A.   No.

3        Q.   They were written for the general public?

4        A.   That's correct.

5        Q.   And as the number one publication in the

6   United States at the time, those articles weren't

7   using terminology that ordinary people couldn't

8   understand, were they?

9        A.   What time?

10        Q.   In the 1930s, '40s and '50s.

11         A.   Well, in the 1950s, I think True Magazine

12   was actually one of the most popular magazines among

13   men.

14        Q.   Did I ask you about True Magazine, Doctor?

15        A.   You said the most popular magazine. I

16   think Reader's Digest's popularity began to decline.

17        Q.   Are you confident that Reader's Digest got

18   eclipsed by some other magazine as the number one

19   magazine in the country?

20        A.   Not totally confident. That's why I was

21    asking.

22        Q.   Let me ask the question again. I'm not

23   sure if you answered it. I got distracted when you

24   mentioned a different magazine.

25             Isn't it true that the Reader's Digest 4908

1    articles that appeared in the 1930s, '40s and '50s

2   were using terminology that ordinary people could

3   understand?

4        A.   Sure. I mean, it was written so people

5   could -- they were articles for the general public,

6   so they used words that people could understand, and

7   they often covered topics related to smoking and

8   health and tried to present it in a way that the

9   layperson could understand it.

10        Q.   I think one of the exhibits that you

11    talked about over the course of your direct

12   testimony was a document written by a Claude Teague

13   in 1972, Plaintiffs Exhibit PT-1920. Do you

14   remember that?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And I believe that Mr. Teague in that

17   document referred to nicotine as the sine qua non;

18   remember that phrase?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   And that sort of means without which

21    nothing?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   So that nicotine was basically essential

24   to smoking; do you remember that?

25        A.   That's correct. 4909

1         Q.   Isn't it true that Reader's Digest said

2   the same thing about 20 years earlier?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=258
3        A.   Used that terminology?

4        Q.   Yeah, described nicotine as the essential

5   ingredient of tobacco.

6        A.   I don't recall that, but I don't dispute

7   that something like that might have been stated in

8   one of the articles.

9        Q.   Well, let me just ask, isn't it true that

10   the notion that a cigarette is a delivery system for

11    nicotine was not a novel idea in the 1950s?

12        A.   Right, any tobacco product that contained

13   nicotine was a delivery system for nicotine.

14        Q.   In fact, the 1988 Surgeon General's report

15   references a 1942 article by a scientist named

16   Johnston. Do you remember that one? You've seen it

17   before, I know.

18        A.   The Lancet paper, I believe.

19        Q.   Yeah, the Lancet paper.

20             Again, I can show it to you if you wish.

21    Let me know at any time.

22        A.   It would be useful to refresh my memory if

23   you want to talk about it.

24        Q.   Let's get the Surgeon General's report,

25   Defense Exhibit AS34, the 1988 Surgeon General's 4910

1   report.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach, again?

3             THE COURT: You may.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

5     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

6        Q.   And if you'll turn to page 10,1 believe.

7   Yes, the bottom of the first full paragraph on the

8   page, Doctor.

9        A.   Okay.

10        Q.   If you could read that to yourself, and

11    then I'll ask you a question.

12        A.   Okay.

13        Q.   Do you recall, as reported in the 1988

14   Surgeon General's report --

15             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. I'm

16        sorry. If there's going to be a reference to

17        the contents of this document, it should be

18        admitted into evidence. I have absolutely no

19        objection to it being admitted into evidence,

20        but there should be no reference to what the

21         document says unless and until it's admitted.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm only going to ask him

23        if he recalls what Dr. Johnston said in his

24         1942 article, as reflected in the Surgeon

25        General's report that he reviewed. 4911

1              MR. SCAROLA: I'm not objecting to it

2        being admitted. It can come in, but until it

3        comes in, we shouldn't be talking about what's

4        in the document.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=259
5             THE COURT: Is there an objection to it

6        being admitted into evidence?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, he relied

8        upon it as a part of his direct examination. I

9        think I'm entitled to ask him questions based

10        on it.

11              THE COURT: You don't want to move it in?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Well, it has not yet been

13        moved into evidence, and it is my understanding

14        that at least during plaintiffs case, I wasn't

15        supposed to be moving stuff into evidence.

16        They objected yesterday with respect to some

17        other matters.

18             THE COURT: Let me have counsel approach.

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: If the expert relied upon the

22        document in rendering his opinion, counsel

23        should be able to explore.

24             MR. KELLY: Say it again.

25             THE COURT: If counsel relied on this in 4912

1        rendering his opinion on certain documents,

2        then counsel should be able to ask him about

3        those documents that he reviewed.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I absolutely agree.

5             THE COURT: I don't know they need to be

6        in evidence to ask him about documents he

7        relied upon in rendering his opinion.

8             MR. SCAROLA: Respectfully, I think the

9        fact that -- his reliance does permit the

10        document to be admitted into evidence, but

11         until it's admitted into evidence, the contents

12        of the document should not be referenced,

13        that's plaintiffs position. I have no

14        objection to it coming in.

15             THE COURT: Just to clear up, does defense

16        object to it coming in?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't object to it

18        coming in. Plaintiffs are putting up as

19        demonstrative exhibits all sorts of things that

20        weren't in evidence, including the Fagerstrom

21         test that was a demonstrative that they had

22        Mrs. Piendle fill out on the stand, and that is

23        absurd.

24             THE COURT: I'm going to take a look at

25        that issue, but as a timesaver, if there's not 4913

1         an objection to it coming in, let's have it in.

2        I will take a closer look, and maybe over the

3        break we can explore that, whether the exhibit

4        has to be in evidence before he can testify

5        about it.

7        report is that big. There might be portions

8        that shouldn't come in. The particular part

9        we're talking about, I don't think anybody has

10        an objection to that part coming in.

11              THE COURT: I'm going to allow the

12        questions, understanding there's no objections

13        to at least this portion coming in, and take a

14        look at this here.

15             MR. SCAROLA: Our objection is that any

16        portion, it should be the entire document.

17             THE COURT: We'll take that up at the

18        break.

19             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

20        concluded and the following proceedings were

21         held within the presence of the jury:)

22     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

23        Q.   Ready?

24        A.   I'm ready.

25        Q.   Okay. So am I. 4914

1              Do you recall, Doctor, that the 1988

2   Surgeon General's report reported --

3             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. For

4        the record, the record should reflect that all

5        of the portions to which counsel is referencing

6        are being offered into evidence, they're being

7        admitted without objection, so I don't have any

8        problem with that, with the understanding that

9        we'll have an opportunity to offer any

10        additional segments we choose to at the

11         appropriate time.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: If I could have Defense

13        Exhibit AS34, please.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   This is a segment from the 1988 Surgeon

16   General's report that you were a reviewer for?

17        A.   Right.

18        Q.   The one that you discussed during the

19   course of your direct examination with Mr. Scarola,

20   right?

21         A.   Correct.

22        Q.   And let's just talk about it.

23             The whole yellow, please. Great. Thanks.

24             And it is reported there that as early as

25   the 1920s and '30s, some investigators were 4915

1    concluding that nicotine was responsible for the

2   compulsive use of tobacco products, and it cites a

3   number of publications, right?

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And then it goes on to report that

6   Johnston in 1942 concluded that smoking is

7   essentially a means of administering nicotine, just

8   as smoking opium is a means of administering

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=261
9   morphine.

10             First of all, do you see that?

11         A.   I do.

12        Q.   Secondly, 1942 was 30 years before

13   Dr. Claude Teague wrote in an internal document that

14   nicotine was the sine qua non of cigarette smoking,

15   right?

16        A.   That's right. His document was 1972.

17        Q.   Hardly a new idea in 1972, would you

18   agree?

19        A.   I would agree that Dr. Teague's article

20   was authored in 1972.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I'm not sure

22        that we've given this exhibit a number.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: I actually read it out.

24        I'll read it again.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I apologize. 4916

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: AS, apple, Sam, 34.

2             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

3             THE COURT: I'm sorry, AS --

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: AS34.

5             You can take that down as well. Thanks.

6     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

7        Q.   Isn't it true that over the years, smoking

8   behavior had been characterized a number of

9   different ways?

10        A.   Yes.

11         Q.   For example, you know, that the Diagnostic

12   and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric

13   Association refers to it as -- uses the term

14   "dependence" to discuss smoking and other drugs --

15        A.   Correct.

16        Q.   --right?

17             You yourself have used the terms

18    "addiction" and "dependence" interchangeably,

19   correct?

20        A.   That's correct.

21         Q.   And at times you have used the word

22   "habit" interchangeably with "addiction" and

23    "dependence"?

24        A.   Right. I think I said that yesterday.

25        Q.   You did. And you agree, and I think you 4917

1    said this yesterday as well, that no matter what

2   label you use, it's the behavior, not the label that

3   is important, right?

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And I think you said, "I don't care what

6   you call it," right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   And the behavior that you're talking

9   about, whether you call it a habit or an addiction

10   or a dependence, is that it can be difficult to quit

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=262
11    smoking, true?

12        A.   I think what I said was drug-reinforced.

13        Q.   Okay. And that it can be difficult to

14   quit?

15        A.   It surely is, yes.

16        Q.   Now, this 1964 Surgeon General's report

17   that you also discussed briefly during your direct

18   examination acknowledged, did it not, that smoking

19   can be difficult to quit?

20        A.   It did.

21         Q.   The Surgeon General's report in 1964 also

22   acknowledged that nicotine could have an affect in

23   the central nervous system including the brain,

24   didn't it?

25        A.   It did. 4918

1         Q.   The Surgeon General also recognized that

2   cigarette smoking -- that nicotine, rather, was an

3   important reason why people smoked cigarettes,

4   right?

5        A.   It did.

6        Q.   And didn't the Surgeon General's report in

7    1964 also observe that cigarettes that did not

8   contain nicotine had not found general public

9   acceptance?

10        A.   It did. In other words, people would be

11    able to stop smoking.

12        Q.   Isn't it true that over the years, based

13   upon your review of the various Surgeon General's

14   reports, the Surgeon General has referred to smoking

15   as a personal choice behavior?

16        A.   They have used that terminology.

17        Q.   Do you recall whether or not that that

18   terminology was used in the 1977, 1978 Surgeon

19   General's report?

20        A.   I don't know which reports it's been used

21    in, but I know in some of my testimony it's been

22   brought up that that terminology was used, and I've

23   heard it referenced before.

24        Q.   Do you know whether or not in 1986 the

25   Surgeon General referred to cigarette smoking as an 4919

1    addictive behavior that the individual must decide

2   whether to continue or not?

3        A.   No, the '86 report was on involuntary

4   smoking.

5        Q.   You don't remember that?

6        A.   I don't know. That was on the health

7   effects of secondhand smoke, so I'm not sure whether

8   they talked about it in that regard. They may have.

9        Q.   You want to -- may I show you to see if

10   you can recall it?

11         A.   Sure. There have been 30 reports. I

12   haven't memorized every word in the thousand pages

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=263
13   of each report.

14        Q.   Fair enough.

15             If I can have AS33, please.

16        A.   Thank you.

17        Q.   The last page of the exhibit is what I

18   wanted to have you take a look at, Doctor.

19        A.   Sure.

20        Q.   And for the record, it's Roman numeral --

21    little Roman numeral XII. And I'm looking at the

22   first sentence of the last paragraph, the

23   introduction by Surgeon General Koop. You see it?

24        A.   I do.

25        Q.   Does that refresh your recollection as to 4920

1   whether or not in 1986 the Surgeon General describes

2   cigarette smoking as an addictive behavior that the

3   individual smoker must decide whether to continue --

4   to decide whether to continue?

5             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

6        Again, I have no objection to this document,

7        but before the contents of the document are

8        referenced, it should be admitted into

9        evidence.

10             THE COURT: Counsel, you want to approach?

11              (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

12        held out of the presence of the jury:)

13             THE COURT: My understanding of the law is

14        that as long as an expert witness has relied

15        upon it, and as long as it's the kind of

16        information reasonably relied upon by experts,

17        the evidence does not need to be admitted in

18        order for the witness to testify about it.

19             I am going to allow the witness to testify

20        about it. We can take up whether there's no

21         objection to portions being admitted, but I am

22        going to allow him to testify about it. I

23        don't think there's any dispute he relied upon

24        it, and it's the type of information reasonably

25        relied upon. 4921

1              MR. SCAROLA: I don't think that predicate

2        has been laid yet.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: The Surgeon General's

4        report, if I need to do it.

5             THE COURT: Which predicate, that he's

6        relied upon it?

7             MR. SCAROLA: That he's relied upon it.

8             THE COURT: Why don't you lay that

9        predicate. You need to bring counsel back.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Jack.

11              MR. HENK: Both yesterday as to

12        photographs, and today on two occasions now,

13        plaintiffs counsel has suggested that

14        documents be admitted into evidence during the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=264
15        plaintiffs case in chief that the defendants

16        were not requested to be admitted in the

17        plaintiffs case in chief.

18             I know your Honor has admitted them, but

19        it was not for the record the defendants that

20        were seeking --

21              THE COURT: Has admitted what?

22             MR. HENK: Those documents.

23             THE COURT: Which documents?

24             MR. HENK: The two paragraphs.

25             THE COURT: I haven't admitted anything 4922

1        right now. We're talking about whether counsel

2        can ask the witness about the Surgeon General's

3        report, and I said he can.

4             MR. HENK: I think you thought Mr. Scarola

5        said a document was admitted without objection.

6             THE COURT: Counsel at the previous

7        sidebar indicated that the portion he was

8        asking the witness about they didn't object to.

9        I don't think I made an official ruling, but

10        they both decided that they didn't object to

11         that portion.

12             But my ruling at that point, having

13        studied the law, is it need not be admitted as

14        long as a predicate is laid.

15             MR. HENK: I agree with you, he did not

16        move anything into evidence.

17             THE COURT: Okay.

18             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

19        concluded and the following proceedings were

20        held within the presence of the jury:)

21      BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

22        Q.   Ready?

23        A.   Ready.

24        Q.   Let me ask the question again because I

25   think -- I've lost the thread, and I'm sure others 4923

1   may have to.

2             Isn't it true that in 1986, the Surgeon

3   General's report, in the preface by Dr. Koop, the

4   then Surgeon General, said that cigarette smoking --

5             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. He's

6        supposed to ask the reliance question first.

7             THE COURT: You may lay the predicate.

8     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

9        Q.   Doctor, you have reviewed the Surgeon

10   General's reports?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   You rely upon them routinely in your

13   testimony, do you not?

14        A.   I do.

15        Q.   You recognize them as authoritative?

16        A.   I do.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=265
17             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much.

18             THE COURT: You may proceed.

19     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

20        Q.   Isn't it true that in 1986, the Surgeon

21    General of the United States, then Surgeon General

22   Koop, right?

23        A.   C. Everett Koop, yes.

24        Q.   Yes. Reported that cigarette smoking is

25   an addictive behavior, and the individual smoker 4924

1   must decide whether or not to continue that

2   behavior?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Thank you.

5             Now, as I think you discussed in your

6   direct testimony, in 1988, the Surgeon General for

7   the very first time decided that smoking should be

8   called an addiction.

9        A.   Well, apparently not, because he said it

10   was an addiction in 1986.

11         Q.   Yes. And as we discussed, the terms are

12   oftentimes used interchangeably, "addiction,"

13    "dependence," "habit," right?

14        A.   Well, the report in 1988 was unique

15   because it focused on smoking behavior. So it was

16   the first of the Surgeon General's reports to be

17   devoted to the behavioral effects of smoking, in

18   other words, why people smoke. All the other

19   reports up to that time had been on the health

20   consequences of smoking.

21         Q.   And so it's the first time, in 1988, that

22   the Surgeon General focused on smoking as a behavior

23   as a principal focus of the report?

24        A.   That's right.

25        Q.   And in 1988, as I think you discussed, the 4925

1    Surgeon General used a different definition of

2   addiction that would be the classic definition that

3   had been used in the 1964 report, when there was a

4   chapter devoted to the subject, right?

5        A.   Well, the classic definition you're

6   referring to, the American Psychiatric Association

7   in 1964 included intoxication, so a drug had to be

8   intoxicating in order to be addictive. That

9   definition went out of favor actually by the World

10   Health Organization a few years later.

11              And then in 1988 when they did the report

12   devoted to tobacco use, they included the experts

13   who put that report together, you know, reviewed the

14   history and looked at the prevailing evidence that

15   had accumulated at that time to look at, and

16   classified cigarette smoking as addictive. And they

17   talked about various criteria for defining nicotine

18   addiction, which was quite relevant to defining

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=266
19   treatments for smokers.

20        Q.   Doctor, my only question was in 1988, the

21    definition changed from the classic definition used

22   in 1964, yes or no?

23        A.   That would be a no. The definition didn't

24   change, it was just the first time they had devoted

25   a report to it. 4926

1         Q.   Well, the Surgeon General in 1964 used the

2   definition of addiction. You're not disputing that,

3   are you?

4        A.   They did, they used the American

5   Psychiatric definition, which defined addictive

6   drugs as having to be intoxicated.

7        Q.   You don't dispute that in 1988, the

8   Surgeon General used a different definition?

9        A.   They did. They reviewed the history of

10   the various definitions that had been used, and they

11    used a different definition. But it wasn't like it

12   changed in 1988. Actually, the World Health

13   Organization changed the definition, I believe, in

14    1968.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Move to strike the

16        response of the last portion of the answer,

17        your Honor.

18             THE COURT: I will grant that.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, I don't know what

20        the last portion means, your Honor. I'm not

21         sure what's been stricken at this point.

22             THE COURT: Counsel, why don't you just

23        state what portion you are seeking.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't have the

25        real-time, so I can't do it. I certainly can't 4927

1         do it from memory.

2             THE COURT: If you want to rephrase the

3        question or ask the question again so that the

4        witness can answer only that question which was

5        posed to the witness.

6     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

7        Q.   In 1988, the Surgeon General used a

8   different definition of addiction than had been used

9   in the 1964 report, wherever it may have come from,

10   it was different, right?

11         A.   It was different.

12        Q.   And one of the differences, I think you

13   pointed out, was that no longer was an addictive

14   drug required to be intoxicating, right?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   There were other differences as well,

17   true?

18        A.   That's correct.

19        Q.   Isn't it true that there were addiction

20   experts at the time who said that the definition

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=267
21    should not be changed in 1988?

22        A.   Well, there were people who in 1988 didn't

23   agree with the criteria that were articulated in the

24    1988 report. I don't think the definitions changed

25   in '88. They changed earlier. 4928

1         Q.   There were people who disagreed, who were

2   addiction experts, in 1988 with the definition that

3   was used in the 1988 Surgeon General's report, true?

4        A.   There were, yeah.

5        Q.   And those were experts who were not

6   associated with the tobacco industry, right?

7        A.   Yes. I mean, Surgeon General's reports

8   are built on evidence, so they represent the

9   prevailing scientific view, but not everybody

10   necessarily agrees with that. It's the prevailing

11    view, weight of evidence.

12        Q.   Now, you were shown a video clip during

13   the course of your direct examination yesterday of

14   the 1994 Congressional hearing where executives from

15   the tobacco companies were asked whether or not

16   nicotine was addictive. Do you remember that?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   Okay. And that included testimony from

19   Mr. Jim Johnston, who at that time was the chief

20   executive officer of my client, R.J. Reynolds

21    Tobacco Company, right?

22        A.   That's correct.

23        Q.   And you may recall that Mr. Johnston was

24   asked, "Do you believe that nicotine is addictive?"

25   And that his answer was, "Smoking and nicotine 4929

1    clearly do not meet the classic definition of

2   addiction," and then he started to go on and talk

3   about how nicotine is not intoxicating. Do you

4   remember that?

5        A.   That's correct.

6        Q.   Okay. And then Congressman Wyden

7   interrupted him and stopped him from answering

8   further. Do you remember that?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   When Mr. Johnston testified that smoking

11    and nicotine did not meet the classic definition of

12   addiction in part because nicotine was not

13   intoxicating, that was true, wasn't it?

14        A.   Nicotine is not intoxicating, true.

15        Q.   Mr. Johnston never testified that quitting

16   smoking was easy, did he?

17        A.   No, he said it was not addictive.

18        Q.   He never denied that quitting smoking

19   could be hard, did he?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   In fact, during the course of your direct

22   examination, did you show the ladies and gentlemen

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimo^pgNbr=268
23   of the jury a single statement from any tobacco

24   company employee or representative that denied that

25   smoking could be hard to quit? 4930

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   Thank you.

3        A.   Except -- I'll just correct that. Yes, I

4   did.

5        Q.   You did?

6        A.   I did.

7        Q.   Which one was that?

8        A.   There was a Tobacco Institute press

9   release that was May 16th, 1988, Brendan Moran and

10   Walker Merryman talking about the Surgeon General's

11    report, and said that all people had to do was make

12   up their mind to quit, and it was easy to do.

13   40 million Americans had done it, and characterizing

14   cigarette smoking as an addiction was a disservice

15   to the American public.

16        Q.   Okay. Well, that's in evidence, we can

17   look at it. But you would agree, would you not,

18   that just because someone is addicted doesn't mean

19   they cannot quit smoking?

20        A.   I would agree with that.

21         Q.   You would agree that addicted smokers can

22   and do quit smoking every day?

23        A.   Yes, they can. I help them to quit. I

24   run the Quitline.

25        Q.   And over one million Americans quit 4931

1    smoking every year, true?

2        A.   I don't know that number, per se, but I

3   don't dispute that.

4        Q.   You don't dispute that?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report,

7   isn't it true that somewhere in the neighborhood of

8   60 million people have quit smoking?

9        A.   Well, the definition of "quit" is

10   something I pay attention to because those are based

11    on cross-sectional studies, and you really have to

12   look at it longitudinally because many people report

13   that they're not smoking on a given day, and may be

14   smoking again because relapse is part of the

15   addictive process.

16             So I do know the government has put out

17   various statistics on how many former smokers there

18   are, and I think I gave the jury the definition. A

19   hundred cigarettes a day? Do you smoke every day,

20   some days, or not at all? If you're a hundred

21    cigarettes and you're not at all, then you're

22   classified as a former smoker.

23        Q.   Okay. Do you disagree that there are

24   60 million former smokers that has been reported by

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=269
25   the Surgeon General of the United States? 4932

1        A.   I don't disagree with that.

2        Q.   And that would be since 1964, correct?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Okay. Would you agree that at least by

5   your definition, tens of millions of addicted

6   smokers have quit smoking?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Isn't it true that during the time period

9   that Mr. Piendle was -- quit smoking, which I think

10   would have been 1989, right?

11         A.   That's right.

12        Q.   That at that time, approximately

13   90 percent of the millions of people that had quit

14   smoking did so cold turkey?

15        A.   Yes, based on the surveys at that time.

16        Q.   Okay. You mention in your direct

17   examination that you teach a smoking cessation

18   clinic, right?

19        A.   That's right.

20        Q.   And you teach the folks who attend that

21    smoking cessation class that anyone can quit

22   smoking, don't you?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   You have written in pamphlets and other

25   documents that you hand out to smokers that all 4933

1    smokers have the ability to quit, right?

2        A.   Well, they come for treatment. So, yeah,

3   I don't turn anybody away.

4        Q.   Well, a pamphlet that you wrote for the

5   American Cancer Society was entitled "Smart Move, a

6   Stop Smoking Guide." Do you remember that one?

7        A.   That's right.

8        Q.   Again, you can get it out if you want.

9   But the "Smart Move" pamphlet provides guidance to

10   people who want to quit smoking, doesn't it?

11         A.   Right. It talks about the health effects

12   of smoking, nicotine dependence, withdrawal, as well

13   as tips for trying to stay off of cigarettes.

14        Q.   Okay. And you believe at one time that

15   that pamphlet was the most widely disseminated

16   stop-smoking booklet ever, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   Now, why don't we actually get it out.

19   That would be AN 133.

20             May I approach, your Honor?

21              THE COURT: Yes.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

23        A.   Thank you.

24     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

25        Q.   And I wanted to direct your attention --1 4934

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=270
1    don't think our pages are numbered, but that would

2   be the fourth page in. The page that has, at the

3   top, "Do you have what it takes to stop smoking?"

4             If you could pull it up for them.

5             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry. Has this been

6        admitted into evidence?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: No. It's something that

8        had been written. I'm entitled to ask him

9        about it.

10             MR. SCAROLA: I have no objection to it

11         going into evidence, your Honor --

12             THE COURT: The question was, is this

13        something that the witness has written?

14             THE WITNESS: It is.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is.

16             THE COURT: Okay. Perhaps, just lay the

17        predicate that he -- regarding his reliance

18        on -- is this something that he has relied upon

19        in giving his opinion?

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Doctor, this is -

21              MR. SCAROLA: I'm not concerned about that

22        predicate, your Honor. It's just that if it's

23        going to be shown to the jury, it should be

24        marked as an exhibit and admitted into

25        evidence, and I have no objection to that. 4935

1              THE COURT: Okay. I'll have it marked.

2        If you're not seeking to have it admitted into

3        evidence at this time, I'm not going to admit

4        it into evidence at this time, but I will ask

5        you to mark it --

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is marked already,

7        your Honor, as AN, apple, Nancy, 133.

8             THE COURT: Okay.

9     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

10        Q.   Ready, Doctor?

11         A.   I'm ready.

12        Q.   Okay. Good. And you write in big letters

13   at the top of this page "Do you have what it takes

14   to quit smoking?" Right?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   And the first sentence under the heading

17   says "There is no magic cure that can help you stop.

18   Take this short quiz to find out if you have what it

19   takes," right?

20        A.   That's right.

21         Q.   And that's true, isn't it, there's no

22   magic cure?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And then let's take a look at the short

25   quiz to find out if you have what it takes, and it 4936

1    consists of three questions, right?

2        A.   Right.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=271
3        Q.   And the first question is:  "Do you want

4   to stop smoking?" Correct?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   The second question is:  "Are you willing

7   to make some changes in your daily routine?" Right?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   And the third question is:  "Are you

10   willing to put up with some uneasy moments after

11    stopping?" Correct?

12        A.   Correct.

13        Q.   And if we go down just a little bit --

14   yes -- you say, "If you can answer yes to all three

15   questions, you can stop smoking," right?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   Okay. And isn't it true that you believe

18   that anybody can quit smoking if they set their mind

19   to it, if they want to do it, if they're willing to

20   change their daily routines, and they're willing to

21   put up with some uneasy moments after they quit?

22        A.   Well, they can make a quit attempt, but

23   most of the people who attempt to quit, end up

24   quitting for a brief period and relapsing back to

25   smoking, that's been my experience clinically 4937

1   working with thousands and thousands of smokers over

2   the years, but certainly we -- this is really just

3   to assess whether the person is ready to make the

4   quit attempt, and what I've found is that predictors

5   of making a quit attempt are very different than

6   those that predict who is able to sustain that

7   attempt and be off of cigarettes.

8        Q.   Doctor, you didn't tell the folks who

9   answered "yes" to the question, do you want to stop

10   smoking, to the question are you willing to make

11    some changes in your daily routine, and are you

12   willing to put up with some uneasy moments, that

13   they can make a quit attempt, you tell them, you can

14   stop smoking. Do you disagree with that?

15        A.   I said that, but I also then go on to talk

16   about nicotine dependence later on in the document.

17        Q.   Doctor, the answer is -- the question is:

18   Do you disagree that the pamphlet you wrote and what

19   you told smokers, do you disagree that if you can

20   answer "yes" to these three questions, you can stop

21    smoking?

22        A.   I wrote that and I gave the explanation of

23   what it means. It's basically trying to identify

24   people are ready to make a quit attempt, which is

25   the first step in the process of moving towards 4938

1   quitting smoking.

2        Q.   And you believe that they can stop

3   smoking?

4        A.   Yes, I work with people to help them quit.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=272
5        Q.   You also agreed that a smoker is fully

6   responsible for making the decision to quit smoking,

7   didn't you?

8        A.   Yes, a person has to make the decision to

9   quit. Their ability to quit is another matter.

10        Q.   I was about to switch gears and talk a

11    little bit about Mr. Piendle, and why don't we start

12   there. Mr. Piendle was physically capable of

13   quitting smoking for good during any year that he

14   smoked from the 1950s all the way through 1988,

15   true?

16        A.   Well, sure. I mean, he was -- he had to

17   make up his mind to try to quit. He tried to quit

18   many times and then quit for good in 1989.

19        Q.   There was no period of time in which you

20   believe that Mr. Piendle was unable to quit smoking,

21    right?

22        A.   Unable, but he was constrained in his

23   choice is my opinion because as I stated yesterday,

24   he was addicted to nicotine.

25        Q.   He couldn't quit like that? 4939

1        A.   It was not easy for him to quit smoking,

2   that's right.

3        Q.   As I think you noted in 1989, he did quit

4   smoking, true?

5        A.   That's true.

6        Q.   He never relapsed, did he?

7        A.   After '89, that's true.

8        Q.   There's no evidence that he ever smoked a

9   cigarette again after 1989?

10        A.   Right, but he did relapse beforehand.

11         Q.   When Mr. Piendle quit smoking in 1989, he

12   did so without any assistance from anyone else; did

13   he not?

14        A.   I believe he chewed gum and toothpicks, as

15   I recall, but those were the aids that he used,

16   which are common, oral aids that people use for

17   trying to stay away from cigarettes.

18        Q.   Right. He didn't use any antismoking

19   medications, like nicotine gum, which would have

20   been available, I believe, at that time by

21   prescription, right?

22        A.   That was the only stop smoking medication

23   available at the time was the gum, and he did not

24   use the nicotine gum from my review of the records.

25        Q.   In fact, do you remember whether the patch 4940

1   became available in 1992; is that right?

2        A.   December of 1992.

3        Q.   Mr. Piendle didn't try hypnosis, right?

4        A.   No.

5        Q.   He didn't go to a smoking cessation

6   clinic, did he?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=273
7        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

8        Q.   In 1989, he did not ask a doctor, at least

9   based upon your review of the records, for any

10   assistance in quitting smoking, did he?

11         A.   No.

12        Q.   Do you know if he ever asked a doctor for

13   assistance in quitting smoking, based upon the

14   records that you reviewed?

15        A.   Based upon the records I reviewed, no, I

16   don't know that.

17        Q.   He had not yet been diagnosed with his

18   lung cancer in 1989, that occurred six years later,

19   right?

20        A.   '95.

21         Q.   And he hadn't yet been diagnosed with any

22   disease that is a smoking-related disease when he

23   quit in 1989, true?

24        A.   I don't believe that he had been formally

25   diagnosed, no. 4941

1         Q.   He didn't tell his wife that he was

2   planning to quit, did he?

3        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

4        Q.   You didn't tell her that he had quit

5   initially, right?

6        A.   I recall that, yes.

7        Q.   He didn't ask Mrs. Piendle to quit with

8   him, right?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   Okay. And Mrs. Piendle noticed that he

11    had quit a couple of days later when she saw he

12   wasn't smoking anymore, right?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   Now, pharmacology is the branch of science

15   that studies the effects of drugs on the human body,

16   right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   And when you talked to this jury about how

19   nicotine affects the brain, you are not speaking as

20   an expert in pharmacology, are you?

21         A.   No, I'm not a pharmacologist, I'm an

22   expert in human smoking behavior.

23        Q.   Would you defer to Dr. Benowitz on issues

24   like the effect of nicotine on the brain?

25        A.   I consider Dr. Benowitz an expert in the 4942

1    area of nicotine addiction, certainly.

2        Q.   Okay. So would you defer to him on issues

3   that are outside of your expertise?

4        A.   I don't know what issues I'm deferring to

5   him.

6        Q.   The effects of nicotine on the brain.

7        A.   I would certainly rely on Dr. Benowitz's

8   expertise in that area.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=274
9        Q.   You think he has superior expertise to

10   your own in that area, sir?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   Thank you.

13             Psychiatrists, in their practice,

14   typically diagnose dependence and addiction, right?

15        A.   Well, doctors diagnose nicotine and

16   dependence, and psychiatry is one branch of

17   medicine, and mostly it's family doctors who do the

18   diagnosing, though.

19        Q.   Let me just ask you, you're not a

20   psychiatrist, correct?

21         A.   No.

22        Q.   You're not a clinical psychologist, are

23   you?

24        A.   No, I'm not.

25        Q.   If a smoker comes to your smoking 4943

1    cessation class and asks for a prescription drug to

2   help him or her quit smoking like, say, Chantix,

3   right, you can't prescribe it, can you?

4        A.   No, I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't

5   prescribe medications.

6        Q.   And when you tell the ladies and gentlemen

7   of this jury that a smoker, Mr. Piendle, was

8   addicted, you can't call that a diagnosis, can you?

9        A.   No. It's an assessment, and I have a lot

10   of experience in doing assessments of smoking

11   behavior.

12        Q.   And that's because medical doctors make

13   diagnoses, right?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   And you're not a medical doctor, right?

16        A.   That's correct.

17        Q.   And you know, from your review of

18   plaintiffs responses to interrogatories in this

19   case -- which was part of the materials you

20   reviewed, right?

21         A.   That's correct.

22        Q.    that the plaintiff takes the position

23   that addiction is a medical diagnosis, correct?

24        A.   I've seen that, yes.

25        Q.   You've mentioned you're not a medical 4944

1    doctor and you don't have a license to practice

2   medicine anywhere, do you?

3        A.   No. Not being a medical doctor, I don't

4   have a license to practice medicine.

5        Q.   And like Mrs. Piendle, you are not a

6   doctor who is qualified to give a medical diagnosis

7   of addiction, true?

8        A.   Well, I don't give a diagnosis, I do an

9   assessment, and I've assessed tens of thousands of

10   smokers and actually do teaching of doctors that are

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=275
11    in medical school or dental school, school of

12   pharmacy, school of nursing, to educate other health

13   professionals how to do a diagnosis.

14        Q.   Is that a "yes," Doctor?

15        A.   That's an explanation of what I do.

16        Q.   Is the answer "yes," that you are not

17   qualified to give a medical diagnosis that

18   Mr. Piendle was addicted?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. The

20        witness is not obliged to answer yes or no if

21         such a response is not complete and might be

22        misleading to the jury.

23             THE COURT: Well, if the witness needs to

24        explain his answer, certainly he may. 25

4945

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   Isn't it true that you are not qualified

3   to give a medical diagnosis of addiction?

4        A.   I am not qualified to give any medical

5   diagnosis because I am not a doctor of medicine.

6        Q.   And we know that none of Mr. Piendle's

7   medical doctors ever treated him for any addiction

8   to cigarettes, true?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   And is it not also true that none of his

11    medical doctors ever diagnosed him as addicted to or

12   dependent upon cigarettes or nicotine?

13        A.   They didn't use that language. They

14   certainly described his smoking status as a heavy

15   smoker. Most doctors don't use that terminology in

16   the medical records, has been my experience in

17   reviewing medical records, thousands of them.

18        Q.   Dr. Cummings, you did testify on direct

19   regarding your nonmedical assessment that

20   Mr. Piendle was addicted, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   And I'd like to talk about that a little

23   bit.

24             THE COURT: Okay. Would this be a

25        convenient breaking point? 4946

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: This would be a

2        convenient time.

3             THE COURT: We'll take our midmorning

4        break right now, and I would ask everyone to be

5        back just a little bit before 11:30, so a

6         15-minute break. Remember the important

7        instruction not to discuss the case, not to

8        talk with anyone associated with the case,

9        avoid any media, do not do any research.

10             Remind the witness you're under oath, do

11         not discuss your testimony with anyone, and

12        we'll see you back a little bit before 11:30.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=276
13        Thank you.

14             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

15        after which the following proceedings were

16        held:)

17             THE COURT: The issue regarding the

18        admissibility of the documents that were shown

19        by defense to which plaintiffs expert has

20        relied upon. My understanding of 704 is that,

21         reading from part of it, if the facts or data

22        are the type reasonably relied upon by experts

23        on subjects for the opinion expressed, the

24        facts or data --

25             THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry, your 4947

1        Honor.

2             THE COURT: -- if the facts or data are of

3        the type reasonably relied upon by experts on

4        the subject to support the opinion expressed,

5        the facts or data need not be admissible in

6        evidence.

7             So I just want to clarify what everyone's

8        position is on this. Does defense take the

9        position you need not admit them into evidence?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think I've been given

11         free reign to cross-examine this witness. In

12        fact, I think that that specific reference

13        under the rules is only limited to those

14        instances when you're trying to impeach the

15        witness' testimony.

16             In this case, I'm not even trying to do

17        that. Look, the man has a significant command,

18        he's relied upon a lot of stuff. I think I'm

19        entitled to ask him. If he doesn't remember,

20        I'm entitled to show it to him, and I'm

21         entitled to elicit that information and even to

22        show it in front of the jury as part of my

23        cross-examination, whether or not he has relied

24        upon it and it was authoritative. But almost

25        all the materials would fall under that 4948

1        umbrella anyway.

2             THE COURT: Anything from the defense

3        before I hear from the plaintiff?

4             MR. KELLY: Yes, your Honor.

5             Unlike some types of technical information

6        that might be used to impeach an opinion

7        because it's different or contrary to the

8        opinion, most of this technical material is

9        being offered as a fact of historical

10        significance in the historical development of

11         the information available to the scientific

12        community, medical community, public health

13        community, and public at large with respect to

14        smoking and health, the topic this witness

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=277
15        talked about. So it's a fact which is relevant

16        and that's a little different than 704 talks

17        about -- if I got the number right there,

18        your Honor--

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: You did.

20             MR. KELLY: -- with respect to using

21         technical material to impeach a witness. So

22        much of this is a fact which is being

23        established as opposed to impeachment of an

24        opinion by a contrary opinion by an

25        authoritative source. 4949

1              THE COURT: Actually, 704 doesn't speak to

2        impeachment. This is actually just the basis

3        of an expert opinion, 704.

4             MR. HENK: May I just add one thing more,

5        your Honor, because it didn't end up on the

6        record when we spoke at the bench, which is at

7        no point during the plaintiffs case in chief

8        have defendants moved into evidence any

9        document.

10             The plaintiffs, I believe, on three

11         occasions have asked for documents to be

12        admitted during their own case in chief, during

13        our cross-examination, so I just wanted that

14        clear for the record.

15             THE COURT: Okay. Plaintiff.

16             MR. SCAROLA: I will start just briefly

17        responding to Mr. Henk. Mr. Henk was not at

18        the bench conference, so he was probably not

19        aware of the fact that there was a stipulation

20        with regard to a document to be admitted into

21         evidence, and the same is true with regard to

22        the photographs. I don't think I need to

23        respond to that further.

24             THE COURT: Right. Just so there's

25        clarification on -- let's see. All I have 4950

1        is -- there is one document and that was AS34,

2        which was one of the Surgeon General's report,

3        and there was an agreement that only the

4        portions testified to by the witness would be

5        admissible. Plaintiff indicated that plaintiff

6        wanted all -- the entire document in evidence,

7        but I have not ruled that the entire document

8        is in evidence.

9             MR. SCAROLA: That's correct.

10             THE COURT: And I didn't make any other

11         rulings, including on AS33 or 133, because of

12        the position that I am suggesting for

13        discussion at this point. So I'm going to let

14        the plaintiff respond now.

15             MR. SCAROLA: Yes.

16             Your Honor, it is our position that you

17        don't get to introduce the contents of a

18        document unless the document is admitted into

19        evidence. You can't put it up on the screen

20        and show it to the jury unless the document is

21         first admitted into evidence, at least the --

22        whatever you're going to show the jury needs to

23        first be admitted.

24             Now, the fact that the witness has relied

25        upon it provides a predicate for the admission 4951

1         of that document. The fact that it may be a

2        prior inconsistent statement may provide a

3        basis for the introduction of the document.

4        Obviously, if it's the witness' own statement,

5        you can read it to him, just as you would a

6        deposition. You get the answer from him first

7        and you say, isn't it a fact that you wrote

8        something inconsistent with this. On page 4 of

9        this document, didn't you say the following?

10             Now, that's fine. But just like you don't

11         get to put the deposition on the screen to get

12        that portion that is inconsistent before the

13        jury, you don't get to put the pamphlet on the

14        screen unless you introduce it.

15             I don't have an objection to its

16        introduction, but I don't believe we should be

17        showing documents to the jury unless and until

18        the document is admitted in evidence. I don't

19        contest its admissibility. My concern is with

20        the procedure, and the procedure should be mark

21         it for identification, show it to opposing

22        counsel, offer it into evidence before it goes

23        up on the screen. That's my concern.

24             THE COURT: Okay. What I would ask is if

25        plaintiff has any cases to support their 4952

1        position. My understanding of 704, having

2        looked at a number of cases during the

3        testimony, is that these documents need not be

4        admitted. So I'm going to reserve at this

5        point.

6             I am going to ask if you have a case that

7        suggests otherwise, bring it to the Court's

8        attention, but at this point, I am going to

9        allow the testimony to continue in the fashion

10        it has, and with the exception of the agreement

11         as to that one section of the Surgeon

12        General's, I am not admitting any of the other

13        documents, but invite plaintiffs counsel to

14        provide the Court with the authority for

15        position it has taken.

16             MR. SALES: I did want to add one thing.

17        As your Honor knows, there's thousands of these

18        documents. Experience has taught in this

19        courtroom for both sides that sometimes a part

20        of a document used with one witness helps one

21         side and another part of a document with the

22        same witness would help the other.

23             And what counsel has done in the crossing

24        of these witnesses is during the examination,

25        and we're trying to help one another, given us 4953

1         only the page or a portion of the document that

2        they're interested in.

3             THE COURT: Let me interrupt for a moment.

4        I think plaintiffs counsel has agreed -- this

5        much, I don't believe is in dispute -- that if

6        a portion of a document is referenced, even if

7        it's not put into evidence, that you'll provide

8        plaintiffs counsel with the entire document,

9        correct? Mr. Biersteker, you agree with that?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: They're on our exhibit

11         list and I have no objection. I was trying to

12        conserve on the amount of paper we had to

13        wrestle with in the courtroom.

14             THE COURT: I understand, but plaintiffs

15        counsel should be entitled at least to have the

16        entirety of the document that you're utilizing.

17             MR. SALES: The economy of this courtroom

18        doesn't permit, and the number of thousands of

19        pages don't permit every single thing exchanged

20        by the parties to be in the courtroom.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: That's the problem.

22             MR. SALES: It's reasonable to require,

23        when impeaching a witness, that the whole

24        document be given to the opponent so that the

25        opponent can be looking at it before he has to 4954

1         give up --

2             THE COURT: Well, AS34, 33, and 133,

3        defense counsel, is it possible, over this

4        break, to give those three documents to

5        plaintiffs?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: They have got the full

7        document on pamphlet. That was the last one

8        used.

9             MR. SALES: That one is full.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Two Surgeon General's

11         reports, we will get them for them. I don't

12        know if it's possible to do it in whatever time

13        remains on this break.

14             THE COURT: Your cocounsel, Ms. Kessler,

15        says yes.

16             Are you anticipating any other documents?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, and I will provide

18        them full copies to the best of my ability, but

19        none of this is any surprise.

20             THE COURT: So we'll be in brief recess

21         for a few more minutes.

22             MR. HENK: May I tender a bench brief on

23        the issue of using counsel's submissions during

24        voir dire --

25             THE COURT: Yes. 4955

1              MR. HENK: -- and note for the record

2        plaintiffs have not stated what their objection

3        is to their use.

4             THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. We'll be in

5        recess for a few minutes.

6             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

7         11:22 a.m. until 11:36 a.m., after which the

8        following proceedings were held:)

9             THE COURT: Are you anticipating you may

10        finish before the lunch hour?

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Not a chance.

12             THE COURT: No uncertainty about that.

13        What if I made lunch at 2:00 o'clock?

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: If you starve me, maybe,

15        or I fall from exhaustion. But no, not a

16        chance. It's taken longer than I had

17        anticipated it would.

18             THE BAILIFF: Jury entering.

19             (Thereupon, the jury entered the

20        courtroom, after which the following

21        proceedings were held:)

22             THE COURT: Okay. Welcome back. You may

23        be seated, and counsel may proceed.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I proceed,

25        your Honor? 4956

1              THE COURT: Yes, you may.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

3     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

4        Q.   Okay. We were about ready to talk about

5   Mr. Piendle a little bit and your nonmedical

6   assessment that he was addicted. And if I

7   understood your testimony on direct examination,

8   what you look at to determine whether or not a

9   smoker is addicted are two things. First, whether

10   they have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their

11    lifetime, and second, whether they are smoking

12   daily. Did I get that right?

13        A.   Those are part of it. There are obviously

14   additional things that I testified to that I do as

15   part of the assessment.

16        Q.   Yes, you did talk about other things, but

17   I thought that those were in reference to the

18   severity of the dependence as opposed to whether or

19   not somebody was addicted.

20        A.   That's right.

21         Q.   So on the threshold issue of whether

22   somebody is addicted or not, your assessment is they

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=281
23   are addicted if they smoke more than 100 cigarettes

24   in a lifetime and they are smoking daily?

25        A.   Yes, regular daily smoker. 4957

1         Q.   Regular daily smoker. And that's not a

2   definition of addiction that is found in any medical

3   textbook or treatise, is it?

4        A.   No. It's what we use in New York State to

5   basically screen people for treatments so we can

6   match the treatments to a smoker.

7        Q.   That's what you use on the Quitline,

8   right?

9        A.   Quitline, and also utilized in some of our

10   studies where we tracked thousands and thousands of

11    smokers to look at predictors of quitting.

12        Q.   It is on that basis that you assessed

13   Mr. Piendle to be addicted in high school, right?

14        A.   Well, it's --1 look at, as I said, daily

15   use versus nondaily use. Most cigarette smokers are

16   daily users, and then I look at the severity of

17   nicotine dependence or addiction, however you want

18   to label it, which is based on a variety of criteria

19   that I described, such as the amount that somebody

20   smokes per day, the time to first cigarette in the

21    morning. That's an index called the Heaviness of

22   Smoking Index that I utilize because it's validated

23   as a predictor of struggles in quilting smoking, and

24   it's a very quick screen, useful for treatment

25   matching, and it is utilized in a number of the 4958

1    clinical trials that I have going on. So we don't

2   bring people in for clinical trials like our

3   nicotine vaccine trial if they're nondaily smokers.

4        Q.   Again, just to separate the two issues,

5   the first issue in your mind is whether somebody is

6   addicted, and that's 100 cigarettes plus smoking

7   daily, right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And then there's the second issue, which

10   we'll get to in a moment, about the severity of

11    addiction, fair enough?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   It is on the basis of the first part, the

14    100 cigarettes plus smoking daily, that you decided

15   or assessed Mr. Piendle to be addicted in 19 --1

16   think you said '55 or '57, right?

17        A.   I believe he started smoking somewhere

18   between the ages of 13 and 15.

19        Q.   13 and 15. Now, you reviewed depositions,

20   you told us that, right?

21         A.   That's correct.

22        Q.   And you know that Mr. Cabral testified

23   that at least in high school, Mr. Piendle was

24   smoking once in a while, right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=282
25        A.   I think every day before and after school 4959

1   is what I recall.

2        Q.   Do you remember Ms. Worobel testifying

3   that he smoked socially?

4        A.   I recall her primarily talking about the

5   brands of cigarettes she recalled him smoking.

6        Q.   It doesn't surprise you, does it, that an

7   athlete like Mr. Piendle in high school would smoke

8   once in a while or socially?

9        A.   It doesn't surprise me, back at the time

10   that Mr. Piendle was in high school, that he was

11    smoking. I believe it was characterized every day

12   after school or before school, as I recall from one

13   of his friends.

14        Q.   One of his friends?

15        A.   Mr. Cabral, I believe.

16        Q.   Do you know -- there's no record of when

17   Mr. Piendle smoked his first cigarette in the

18   morning when he was in high school, is there?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   And, in fact, I think you probably saw

21    this in the deposition, but Mr. Piendle's mother at

22   least spoke to his brother, Mr. Edward Piendle,

23   about not smoking, right? Do you remember reading

24   that?

25        A.   I don't recall that specifically, but I 4960

1    don't dispute that that might have been mentioned in

2   one of the thousands of pages of deposition records

3   that I reviewed.

4        Q.   Would you expect Mrs. Piendle --

5   Mr. Piendle's mom might be a better way to say it.

6        A.   Right.

7        Q.   Would you expect Mr. Piendle's mom back

8   when he was in high school to let him get away with

9   smoking his first cigarette in the morning over

10   breakfast in the home?

11         A.   No. Generally my experience is that

12   junior high students are not going downstairs to

13   smoke a cigarette with their breakfast in the

14   morning.

15        Q.   In connection with assessing severity of

16   addiction, you talked about withdrawal symptoms,

17   right?

18        A.   That's right.

19        Q.   Okay. And addicted smokers, I think you

20   said when they quit, typically experience withdrawal

21    symptoms, right?

22        A.   That's right.

23        Q.   Okay. And people who are more heavily

24   addicted, I believe you said on direct examination,

25   experience more withdrawal symptoms than people who 4961

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=283
1    are not as severely addicted, right?

2        A.   It's -- the reports of withdrawal, we have

3   to have that they are more likely to be reported by

4   people who are heavier smokers, more frequent per

5   day smokers.

6        Q.   All right. So people who smoke more

7   cigarettes a day are more likely to report more

8   significant withdrawal symptoms than people who

9   smoke fewer cigarettes per day?

10        A.   Frequency of withdrawal.

11         Q.   Frequency of withdrawal?

12        A.   Right.

13        Q.   Isn't it true that withdrawal symptoms

14   usually peak within a few days after quitting, and

15   then decline thereafter?

16        A.   It's been my experience.

17        Q.   And that withdrawal symptoms typically

18   include things like insomnia, right?

19        A.   That's right.

20        Q.   Headaches, isn't that one of them?

21         A.   I have a whole list of them here in the

22   "Smart Move" book. Irritability, tired, trouble

23   sleeping, hunger --

24        Q.   Let's take them one at time. Would you

25   agree that insomnia is one of the symptoms of 4962

1   withdrawal?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Would you agree that headaches are one of

4   the symptoms of withdrawal?

5        A.   Some people report having headaches, yes.

6        Q.   Would you agree that an inability to

7   concentrate is one of the symptoms of withdrawal?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   Would you agree that irritability is one

10   of the symptoms of withdrawal?

11         A.   Yeah, moody, irritability is fairly

12   common.

13        Q.   And I think your "Smart Move" booklet also

14   lists sore throat as one of the symptoms of

15   withdrawal, right?

16        A.   Actually, a dry throat. Because mucous

17   secretion turns off because smoke stimulates mucous

18   secretion, which is one of the reasons people have

19   smoker's cough.

20        Q.   And there are other withdrawal symptoms as

21    well?

22        A.   Yes, there are.

23        Q.   Now, there's no evidence that Mr. Piendle

24   in 1989, when he quit smoking, suffered from

25   insomnia, is there? 4963

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   There is no evidence that he had headaches

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=284
3   when he quit smoking in 1989, is there?

4        A.   Not in'89, no.

5        Q.   There's no evidence that he said he had an

6   inability to concentrate when he quit smoking in

7    1989, correct?

8        A.   That's correct.

9        Q.   There's no evidence that he had a sore or

10   dry throat when he quit smoking in 1989?

11         A.   True.

12        Q.   Isn't it true that Mrs. Piendle in the

13   deposition materials you read said that he was kind

14   of moody when he quit, I think was the quote?

15        A.   She did say that.

16        Q.   Do you remember that she based her

17   observation -- she based her conclusion that

18   Mr. Piendle was kind of moody on the fact that

19   Mr. Piendle didn't talk to her as much when he quit

20   as he had done beforehand? Do you remember that?

21         A.   She did state that he got moody when he

22   quit smoking.

23        Q.   And she did say that because Mr. Piendle

24   wasn't talking to her as much. Do you remember

25   that? 4964

1        A.   Not specifically that statement, I don't

2   recall that. I don't dispute it, but I don't recall

3   that one.

4        Q.   You don't dispute it?

5        A.   Right.

6        Q.   Let me just ask, assuming that the basis

7   for the conclusion that Mr. Piendle was kind of

8   moody was that he wasn't talking to Mrs. Piendle as

9   much as he had before he quit. Are you with me?

10        A.   Sure.

11         Q.   Isn't it true that based upon your review

12   of all the evidentiary record, there are alternative

13   explanations for why Mr. Piendle might have talked

14   less to Mrs. Piendle when he quit smoking?

15        A.   Such as?

16        Q.   Let me give you an example. First, isn't

17   it true that when Mrs. Piendle discovered that

18   Mr. Piendle had quit smoking without her, she was a

19   little upset with him?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   And doesn't our common sense teach us that

22   couples who are a little bit upset with each other

23   might not talk to each other as much?

24        A.   Some people don't talk with each other,

25   and some people talk too much. 4965

1         Q.   So one of the ways that upset might

2   express itself in a relationship is people might not

3   talk to each other as much until they get over it,

4   right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=285
5        A.   Sure.

6        Q.   Second, you, I think, teach in your

7   smoking cessation classes that smokers who are

8   trying to quit should avoid triggers for smoking,

9   right?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   And you would agree with me that a trigger

12   would be being around other people who are smoking?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   In fact, that's probably one of the more

15   powerful triggers out there, right?

16        A.   So we advise people to avoid the triggers

17   as a coping mechanism.

18        Q.   And you specifically advise people who are

19   trying to quit to avoid being around people who are

20   smoking, right?

21         A.   Well, we actually advise them to throw out

22   their cigarettes, that's the most important thing,

23   and sometimes you can't avoid being around other

24   people who smoke.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that you advise them to 4966

1    avoid triggers, including being around other people

2   who are smoking?

3        A.   We advise them to stay away from triggers,

4   including other people who might be smokers, if they

5   can do it. It often comes up that there are other

6   family members who smoke, so it's not always

7   feasible.

8        Q.   Not always feasible. In fact, don't you

9   recommend that people who are trying to quit smoking

10   put "no smoking" signs in their cars or in their

11    work areas or in their homes?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   And as you know from reviewing the

14   evidentiary -- the depositions, rather, in this

15   case, Mrs. Piendle continued to smoke in 1989 when

16   Mr. Piendle quit, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   And do you remember Mrs. Piendle saying in

19   her deposition that Mr. Piendle would get up and

20   leave the room sometimes when she would light up a

21    cigarette in front of him, particularly after he

22   first quit?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Do you remember Mrs. Piendle testifying in

25   her deposition that Mr. Piendle just didn't want to 4967

1   be around her because she was smoking?

2        A.   I believe that's true.

3        Q.   Is it possible that Mr. Piendle was

4   speaking less to Mrs. Piendle after he quit smoking

5   because he was trying to avoid being around her

6   because she was smoking?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=286
7        A.   I don't --1 have no knowledge of why he

8   would not be wanting to be around her, but -- so I

9   don't know.

10        Q.   Don't know. Okay. Not even possible in

11    your view?

12        A.   It's possible.

13        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

14             Now, you talked in your direct examination

15   about prior quit attempts. Do you remember that?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   So let's talk about those. Isn't it true

18   that there is no evidence that Mr. Piendle tried to

19   quit smoking in the 1950s?

20        A.   It's true.

21         Q.   And likewise, there's no evidence that he

22   tried to quit smoking in the 1960s, right?

23        A.   There's no record of it, that's true.

24        Q.   No record. And you mentioned some events

25   in the 1970s and '80s, remember? 4968

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   And there were New Year's resolutions, as

3   I recall.

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And those New Year's resolutions were

6   attempts to quit that were related to health

7   concerns in part?

8        A.   In part.

9        Q.   But isn't it true that based upon your

10   review of the depositions in this case, those

11    various quit attempts weren't all that memorable to

12   Mrs. Piendle?

13        A.   No, I think they were reported that they

14   quit -- made New Year's resolutions to quit, which

15   is a very common time that a lot of people try to

16   change their smoking behavior, and it typically

17   lasted a short duration. And that's what I recall.

18        Q.   Okay. Well, you have notes that you've

19   kept of the deposition materials that you reviewed,

20   right?

21         A.   I have them right here.

22        Q.   And, in fact, during your deposition you

23   would sometimes refer to them, right?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   Do you recall jotting down notes, based on 4969

1   your review of Mrs. Piendle's deposition testimony,

2   that the best she could do was to recall at least

3   one New Year's resolution to quit smoking that she

4   and Mr. Piendle made during the 12-year period from

5    1968 to 1980?

6        A.   What my notes say is prior to 1989, he

7   made many unsuccessful attempts to stop smoking, and

8   I reference various pages of Mrs. Piendle's

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=287
9   transcript, and then additional pages of Tracy

10   Piendle's transcript.

11              Then I go on to say, most quit attempts

12   were of brief duration, although his daughter said

13   he was able to quit for a couple of weeks one time.

14   And then I gave the page numbers there.

15        Q.   It wasn't clear, based upon your review,

16   was it, what years the Piendles attempted to quit

17   smoking around New Year's Eve, was it?

18        A.   No, I don't think they had -- it wasn't

19   clear, as it rarely is when you ask people to recall

20   back decades, the specific dates of quit attempts.

21    They just recall that there are multiple quit

22   attempts, which is fairly common.

23        Q.   Now, there's a notion in your profession

24   that a quit attempt is something that lasts for 24

25   hours or more, right? 4970

1        A.   Well, a quit attempt is when somebody

2   tries to quit smoking. And, you know, typically you

3   can look at duration of quitting of 24 hours if you

4   want to try to characterize withdrawal symptoms. So

5   typically that's what the 24-hour criteria is used

6   to do.

7        Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that the Centers for

8   Disease Control defines a quit attempt as somebody

9   not smoking for 24 hours?

10        A.   The Centers for Disease Control defines

11    quitting, have you ever made a quit attempt, and

12   then they say, have you ever made a quit attempt for

13   24 hours or longer, a day or longer?

14             We actually assess days as well. So I'm

15   quite familiar with their surveys because I advise

16   them about the questions that they put in their

17   surveys.

18        Q.   Good. So one of the ways the Centers for

19   Disease Control characterizes a quit attempt is

20   whether somebody has abstained and not used

21    cigarettes for 24 hours, correct?

22        A.   That's one of the ways, yes.

23        Q.   Isn't it true that the Surgeon General in

24   the 1988 report that you reviewed used a 24 period

25   of continuous abstinence from tobacco to define 4971

1   initial cessation. Do you remember that?

2        A.   Some people have done that, yes. I recall

3   studies that have done that and have been cited in

4   Surgeon General's reports.

5        Q.   Okay. Now, isn't it true that some of the

6   recommendations that you make in your "Smart Move"

7   pamphlet was that folks need to commit themselves to

8   quitting?

9        A.   Sure.

10        Q.   And one of the things you sort of

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=288
11    recommend that smokers do is to actually fill out a

12   stop-smoking contract and have a family member or

13   friend sign the contract with them.

14        A.   It's in the guide. We use, in my clinic,

15   a contract. We actually ask people to put in ten

16   dollars, which we give them back a month later if

17   they are not smoking. The guide was actually

18   developed based on my clinic, but it is in the

19   booklet.

20        Q.   Okay.

21         A.   And-

22        Q.   I'm sorry, were you finished?

23        A.   Well, it's a self-help guide. So,

24   obviously, you can't do it like we do it,

25   face-to-face, at our clinics. 4972

1         Q.   And there's no evidence that the Piendles

2   ever made any such contract when they engaged in

3   these various New Year's resolutions, however many

4   there were, right?

5        A.   My experience is rarely outside the

6   confines of my clinic do people ever do the

7   contract. But we do it in the clinic to sort of

8   build up to the quit date. We prepare people for

9   quitting, and then on the date that they quit, we

10   have them sign the contract. We put in ten dollars,

11    they get the ten dollars back a month later. It

12   gives us an excuse to call them back.

13             And because many people come with family

14   members to quit smoking or friends, we actually pool

15   the money. We make a little joke that you can make

16   money by quitting smoking, because the people who go

17   back to smoking forfeit the ten dollars, and then we

18   divide up the remains among those who quit and stay

19   off. So we get the Rocky fight song out, and they

20   throw their cigarettes in the garbage.

21    Unfortunately, most of the people end up back

22   smoking again.

23        Q.   Let me just ask you a few questions.

24   Isn't it true that as part of the smoking cessation

25   class, you encourage people to throw away their 4973

1    ashtrays and their lighters?

2        A.   Yes. Most importantly their cigarettes.

3        Q.   We'll get to that in a moment.

4             Mr. Piendle did not throw out his lighter

5   when he made these various New Year's resolutions,

6   did he?

7        A.   Not that I recall.

8        Q.   Nor the ashtrays, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And you -- another thing you suggest that

11    smokers do is to tell family members and friends

12   that they either have or are going to stop smoking,

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=289
13   right?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And Mr. and Mrs. Piendle didn't do that in

16   connection with any of these New Year's resolutions,

17   as far as you could tell from the depositions you've

18   read, true?

19        A.   That's not true. No, they told each other

20   they were quitting.

21         Q.   They would tell each other. Fine.

22        A.   That would be the most important thing.

23        Q.   They didn't tell others beyond themselves?

24        A.   I don't know whether they did or not. I

25   don't know if that question was asked. 4974

1         Q.   Do you recall reading that they didn't

2   tell anybody because they didn't want to be

3   embarrassed if they failed? Do you remember reading

4   that?

5        A.   I don't, but that's a common reason that

6   some people, in my experience, are afraid to tell

7   other people that they're trying to quit, because

8   they've had the experience before trying to quit and

9   failed, and don't want to get people's expectations

10   up and be viewed as a failure.

11         Q.   Is it fair to say that the Piendles, in

12   making these various New Year's resolutions,

13   assuming that they did not tell other friends and

14   family members that they were doing it, and did not

15   throw away their ashtrays and did not throw away

16   their lighters, if all that is true, is it fair to

17   say that they were hedging their bets?

18        A.   No, I don't think those are uncommon.

19   People keep their lighters around, sometimes they're

20   gifts, there are other uses of lighters, and if

21    there are other smokers in the home, you're usually

22   not throwing the ashtrays out.

23             When my mom quit smoking, she saved the

24   ashtrays, they became candy dishes. So people are

25   not throwing out stuff. Although we advise people 4975

1   to get rid of all the reminders, but it's just

2   advice and people have to figure it out on their

3   own.

4        Q.   And you advise them to do that as symbols

5   of their commitment to quit?

6        A.   Most important symbol is making a quit

7   attempt.

8        Q.   Doctor, if you can answer the question,

9   please. You advise them to throw away their

10   cigarettes, their ashtrays, their lighters, and to

11    tell people and to make the contract in order to

12   ensure that they are committed to quitting?

13        A.   Those are all suggestions in the "Smart

14   Move" guide, yes.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=290
15        Q.   And they are suggestions -- you may answer

16   the question, please -- in order to make sure that

17   the smoker is as committed as possible to quitting,

18   as symbols of that commitment, aren't they?

19        A.   No. They're trying to remove the common

20   triggers and cues that are around that remind people

21    about their smoking because we know that those

22   symbols and cues become triggers to relapse back to

23   smoking. That's why we advise people to remove

24   them.

25        Q.   I see. Telling your family and friends is 4976

1    a trigger?

2        A.   Being around other people who are smokers

3   is a trigger or committing, obviously, telling

4   others that you're going to quit smoking is --

5        Q.   Telling others that you're -- I'm sorry, I

6   interrupted. Are you finished?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Okay. Telling others that you are going

9   to quit smoking is a form of -- an expression of

10   commitment to quitting; would you agree?

11         A.   I would agree.

12        Q.   Signing a contract is an expression of a

13   commitment to quit; would you agree?

14        A.   I would agree.

15        Q.   Now, when the Piendles made these various

16   New Year's resolutions, they did not attempt to get

17   any prescription for any smoking cessation aid that

18   might have been available at the time, and I realize

19   that there were limited choices.

20        A.   There was the gum, and no, there's no

21    record of getting nicotine gum.

22        Q.   They didn't try hypnosis in connection

23   with any of these quit attempts, correct?

24        A.   They didn't try hypnosis, but probably a

25   good thing because there is no evidence that 4977

1   hypnosis helps you quit smoking.

2        Q.   They didn't go to a smoking cessation

3   clinic like the one you run, did they?

4        A.   No.

5        Q.   And they never asked for any assistance

6   from anyone, as far as you could tell, right?

7        A.   No, just each other to make the resolution

8   to quit smoking.

9        Q.   And do you believe the Piendles were

10   committed to quitting in association with these

11    various New Year's resolutions, even though they

12   didn't do most of the things or maybe none of the

13   things that you recommend as part of your "Smart

14   Move" pamphlet?

15        A.   Yes, I do. I think they were committed

16   and there were a variety of strategies used by

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=291
17   Mr. Piendle, such as chewing gum, chewed on straws

18   and toothpicks, not having cigarettes in the house,

19   cutting back or delaying lighting up, these are all

20   kinds of strategies that are used for quitting

21    smoking.

22        Q.   If a student in one of your smoking

23   cessation classes came to you and said, you know, I

24   want some advice on how to quit smoking, but the

25   student said, I don't want to fill out that 4978

1    contract, I don't want to throw out my lighters, I

2   don't want to throw out my ashtrays, I don't want to

3   tell anyone that I'm going to try to quit, I don't

4   want to take any medication, I don't even want to

5   participate in the class, would you take his quit

6   attempt seriously?

7        A.   Sure.

8        Q.   And from your perspective to judge whether

9   or not somebody has made a serious attempt to quit

10   smoking, you just ask them whether they have ever

11    attempted, right?

12        A.   Well, I certainly ask that question

13   because that's an important marker, and I've done

14   research where we've looked at the experience that

15   people have quitting for less than 24 hours and more

16   than 24 hours, and we find that people who tend to

17   be most addicted often don't make it 24 hours, it's

18   a very common thing. I tracked the relapse profiles

19   of smokers and have written papers on that topic.

20        Q.   Let me try to do this in bites. Isn't it

21    true that you judge whether a particular attempt to

22   quit is serious or not by asking the person whether

23   they tried to quit smoking?

24        A.   It's one basis for it, yes.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that all they have to do is 4979

1    say, yes, I have tried to quit smoking and the

2   attempt is a serious one, in your opinion?

3        A.   Yes, because behavior is the best

4   predictor of future behavior.

5        Q.   Okay. So in your view, literally any

6   attempt to quit smoking is a serious one; is that

7   right?

8        A.   Any attempt that's reported as trying to

9   quit smoking, yeah, absolutely.

10        Q.   Thank you.

11              You discussed yesterday during your --

12   well, maybe not yesterday. It might have been the

13   day before. You discussed in your direct testimony

14   that one of the things you look at in assessing

15   severity of addiction was the smoker's ability to

16   control their smoking in various settings. Do you

17   remember that?

18        A.   Yes.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=292
19        Q.   Okay. And you know that Mr. Piendle would

20   sit through entire meals without smoking, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   You know that there's no evidence that he

23   got up in the middle of the night to smoke, true?

24        A.   That's right.

25        Q.   You know he would go to church services 4980

1    and he wouldn't get up and leave during the service

2   in order to smoke, right?

3        A.   Correct.

4        Q.   Same thing is true of movies, he would go

5   to the movies and sit through the entire movie and

6   didn't go out to smoke during the middle of it,

7   right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And you also know that his family referred

10   to him repeatedly as being a strong-willed and

11    decisive guy?

12        A.   Correct.

13        Q.   Do you recall Mr. Piendle saying,

14   Mr. Piendle, once he sets his mind to something, he

15   can do it?

16        A.   I recall that.

17        Q.   Okay.

18        A.   Except for quitting smoking.

19        Q.   Well, he did it, didn't he?

20        A.   Eventually.

21         Q.   Okay. Mr. Piendle never told anybody he

22   was unable to quit smoking, did he?

23        A.   Not that I recall.

24        Q.   He never told anybody, I can't quit

25   smoking, did he? 4981

1        A.   I don't recall any testimony to that

2   effect.

3        Q.   There's no evidence that he ever went to

4   somebody and said, hey, I'm addicted?

5        A.   I think his daughter felt that her dad was

6   addicted to cigarettes.

7        Q.   Answer the question, please.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: I move to strike as

9        nonresponsive, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: I will strike the testimony.

11         The question was whether Mr. Piendle had told

12        anyone whether he was addicted, not what his

13        daughter had said.

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: That's correct.

15     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

16        Q.   Let me just reask the question. There's

17   no evidence that Mr. Piendle said to anyone ever,

18   I'm addicted?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Thank you.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=293
21              Now, you talked about a couple of

22   different tests, I think, during the course of your

23   direct examination, one of them was the DSM-IV, the

24   manual that the psychiatrists use, the diagnostic

25   and statistical manual? 4982

1        A.   I'm not sure we talked about it, but I'm

2   familiar with it.

3        Q.   Let me just ask the question: You did not

4   apply that particular diagnostic tool used by

5   psychiatrists and psychologists in order to assess

6   whether or not Mr. Piendle was addicted, did you?

7        A.   I did not apply it because it's not as

8   valid as the tool that I applied.

9        Q.   Okay. You did not use the Fagerstrom test

10   to assess the severity of Mr. Piendle's dependence,

11    did you?

12        A.   Well, I'm familiar with the Fagerstrom

13   test and I used elements of Fagerstrom, which are

14   contained in the Heaviness of Smoking Index.

15        Q.   Sir, my question was: Did you use the

16   Fagerstrom test to assess the level of Mr. Piendle's

17   dependence?

18        A.   No.

19        Q.   Thank you.

20        A.   That's not entirely correct, actually.

21    I'm familiar with all these measures, they're all

22   very similar. But I explicitly talk about, in my

23   notes, which I testified to in my deposition, the

24   Heaviness of Smoking Index.

25        Q.   You know, sir, isn't it true, and I can 4983

1    get it out, if you want, that in your deposition you

2   said you didn't use the Fagerstrom test in this

3   particular case?

4        A.   I did not use the six-item Fagerstrom

5   Tolerance Scale, no.

6        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

7             Now, what you did use was what you refer

8   to as the Heaviness of Smoking Index, right?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   And the Fagerstrom test and your Heaviness

11    of Smoking Index is used to assess the level of

12   addiction, right?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And your Heaviness of Smoking Index

15   basically consists of two of the six questions that

16   are in the Fagerstrom test, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   It's how much you smoke every day and when

19   you have your first cigarette in the morning?

20        A.   Right.

21         Q.   Isn't it true that any smoker to whom your

22   Heaviness of Smoking Index is given will get a score

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=294
23   between zero and six?

24        A.   Well, the scale goes from zero to six,

25   that's right. 4984

1         Q.   So if it's applied to somebody, they get a

2   score between zero and six, right?

3        A.   If it's applied to you, you'd get a score

4   between zero and six. If you apply it to anybody,

5   you get a score between zero and six.

6        Q.   If you get a six, you're dependent, right?

7        A.   Actually, labels that are applied are

8   depending on where you fall with the score. A six

9   would be, you know, the highest level on that scale

10   or heavily dependent.

11         Q.   And if you get a zero, you are dependent?

12        A.   If you get a zero, you're not dependent.

13        Q.   Don't you have a light nicotine dependence

14   if you have a zero?

15        A.   It goes, I believe, up to ten cigarettes,

16   and if you're smoking zero cigarettes, then you

17   would get a zero.

18        Q.   Ten or fewer cigarettes gives you a zero,

19   right?

20        A.   Well, ten or fewer. If you're smoking

21    zero, you get a zero.

22        Q.   You get a zero. And if you get a zero,

23   you have light dependence, right?

24        A.   That's just a label that they apply

25   because it's applied to smokers, it's not applied to 4985

1   nonsmokers.

2        Q.   And that's the point, isn't it? If you

3   apply this test, if one were, and I realize you may

4   disagree and say this is something that shouldn't be

5   done, but if you gave your Heaviness of Smoking

6   Index test to someone who had never smoked a

7   cigarette in their life, the answer would be zero,

8   right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And they would be lightly dependent?

11         A.   No, that's a label. I didn't put the

12   label on there. They would be a zero.

13        Q.   Isn't it true that regardless of what his

14   smoking behavior was, at least on the Heaviness of

15   Smoking Index, Mr. Piendle could not have escaped

16   being labeled as dependent or addicted?

17        A.   Well, he was a daily smoker, which is the

18   first criteria that I looked at, and then I applied

19   the Heaviness of Smoking Index, and by my

20   assessment, he would score either a five or six,

21    which was among the highest categories on that

22   scale, which has been validated through studies that

23   I've done on others, against the DSM-IV, against

24   Fagerstrom, tends to be a better predictor of

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=295
25   struggles that people have to quit smoking. 4986

1         Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that there's no

2   category on the Heaviness of Smoking Index that says

3   not addicted?

4        A.   That is true.

5        Q.   So at least as to somebody like

6   Mr. Piendle, who is smoking, there's no way that

7   they can take that test and avoid being anything

8   other than dependent?

9        A.   Well, the labels are meaningless, it's

10   really just the scores. It means the five, where

11    you fall on that scale.

12        Q.   It's your test, Doctor, isn't it?

13        A.   Actually, it's a test that was developed

14   by Lynn Kozlowski.

15        Q.   And it's a test you use?

16        A.   Yeah, it's an excellent test. It's a very

17   good screener of --

18        Q.   It's a test you use, yes, thank you.

19             You talked about cigarette companies'

20   design modification to cigarettes related to

21    nicotine. Do you remember that?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   And, of course, you've never designed a

24   commercial cigarette, have you?

25        A.   No. 4987

1         Q.   You've never designed even a prototype

2   cigarette, right?

3        A.   No, I don't design cigarettes.

4        Q.   You don't hold any patents in cigarette

5   design or construction, do you?

6        A.   No, I don't.

7        Q.   You don't have a degree in chemistry,

8   right?

9        A.   No.

10        Q.   Or biology, right?

11         A.   No.

12        Q.   Or physics?

13        A.   Or physics.

14        Q.   Right? And you talked a little bit, I

15   thought, about tar to nicotine ratios?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   And the strategy to reduce the tar to

18   nicotine ratio, to increase nicotine relative to tar

19   in a cigarette, wasn't a secret, was it?

20        A.   No, it has been discussed for about 40

21    years.

22        Q.   Right. And it was a strategy that had

23   been discussed by scientists and members of the

24   public health community for potentially making

25   cigarettes safer, right? 4988

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=296
1        A.   Right, essentially, giving people nicotine

2   without tar.

3        Q.   Right. Exactly. Because it is the tar in

4   cigarette smoke that is thought to contribute to

5   most of the smoking-related diseases, not the

6   nicotine, right?

7        A.   That's true.

8        Q.   All right. So the idea was smokers smoke

9   for nicotine, right?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   And what you'd like to try and do is to

12   design a cigarette that would provide smokers with

13   nicotine, but with as little of the harmful tar as

14   possible, right?

15        A.   Yeah, without the smoke.

16        Q.   Without the smoke, right, okay. And that

17   was something that was published in leading

18   journals, such as the Lancet and the British Medical

19   Journal back in the 1970s, wasn't it?

20        A.   Yes, Dr. Russell.

21         Q.   Dr. Russell, you got it. And it's also

22   something that Sir Richard Doll suggested, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And that was also in the 1970s, wasn't it,

25   if you remember? 4989

1        A.   He's published hundreds of papers. I

2   don't know which of his papers might have mentioned

3   that.

4        Q.   Do you remember whether or not the idea of

5   altering this tar to nicotine ratio was something

6   that was discussed in the 1981 Surgeon General's

7   report as a potential approach for making a safer

8   cigarette?

9        A.   It was, that was the report on the

10   changing cigarette.

11         Q.   Now, isn't it true that at least my

12   client, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, attempted to

13   do that, to change that tar and nicotine ratio?

14        A.   They certainly had a large number of

15   studies that talked about maintaining nicotine

16   levels while trying to lower tar.

17        Q.   And that was the reasonable thing for them

18   to try and do, wasn't it?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. May

20        we have a time frame?

21              THE COURT: Yes.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: Starting in the 1970s.

23        A.   They did talk about it in the 1970s. I

24   just saw a document in 1970s, I believe authored by

25   Dr. Teague to Dr. Senkus. 4990

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   That's correct. And you talked about that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=297
3   in your direct examination.

4        A.   Correct.

5        Q.   Okay. Here is my question: That was a

6   reasonable thing for the company to try and do,

7   wasn't it?

8        A.   To maintain nicotine dependence, no.

9        Q.   No, I didn't ask that question. I said to

10   alter the tar to nicotine ratio.

11         A.   Well, they -- it was something they talked

12   about. I wouldn't say it was a reasonable thing to

13   do. The reasonable thing to do would be to remove

14   the one chemical in the cigarettes, which would be

15   nicotine, that kept people smoking.

16        Q.   Is it your testimony that it was not a

17   reasonable thing for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

18   to follow suggestions that were being made in the

19   scientific literature on how to make a safer -- a

20   potentially safer cigarette?

21         A.   No, that would mischaracterize my

22   testimony. My testimony in my characterization of

23   the scientific literature, because of the massive

24   health problems related to smoking, would be to make

25   a product that did not deliver the smoke, if you 4991

1   were going to give the nicotine, or take the

2   nicotine out so that people wouldn't repeatedly

3   expose themselves to the smoke.

4        Q.   So it's got to be all or nothing, black or

5   white, in your view?

6        A.   Yes, it does.

7        Q.   There's no room for marginal error?

8        A.   That was pretty well-defined, I believe,

9   in another document that I shared from Dr. Senkus

10   that talked about smoking compensation.

11         Q.   With all respect, Doctor, I'm not asking

12   you about other documents, I'm asking you for your

13   opinions. I'm asking you, you're saying it would be

14   unreasonable for tobacco companies to attempt to

15   make marginal improvements in the safety or

16   riskiness of their products?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

19             Another document from Reynolds you talked

20   about in your direct examination related to design,

21    which was Plaintiffs Exhibit 1233, which was a 1973

22   memo from Frank Colby to Mr. Blevins regarding a

23   larger share of the youth market. Do you remember

24   that one?

25        A.   I do. 4992

1         Q.   Now, Mr. Piendle was 32 when that memo was

2   written, right?

3        A.   That's correct.

4        Q.   He was certainly not a youth, right?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=298
5        A.   No.

6        Q.   And you know that the author of that memo,

7   Dr. Colby, spent his career in the research and

8   development department at Reynolds, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   Like Dr. Teague, Dr. Colby was not ever in

11    the marketing department of the company, correct?

12        A.   He was in the research part of the

13   department, is my understanding.

14        Q.   Yes. He was not in the marketing

15   department, correct?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   No-

18        A.   He was not in the marketing.

19        Q.   It might be partially my fault for the

20   question. Dr. Colby never worked in the marketing

21    department; is that true?

22        A.   That's my understanding, that's true.

23        Q.   I think you said yesterday that you

24   thought Dr. Colby was Dr. Teague's boss. Do you

25   remember that? 4993

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   Are you confident of that? Wasn't it the

3   other way around?

4        A.   I believe at the time this memo was

5   written, he was the boss, but I'm not perfectly

6   confident about it, but I believe he was more senior

7   than Dr. Teague.

8        Q.   Isn't it true that you have no information

9   available to you to suggest that Reynolds ever

10   implemented the suggestion that was made in that

11    memo?

12        A.   That's true. The design of the cigarettes

13   is proprietary.

14        Q.   Well, you're reverse engineering all the

15   time, aren't you?

16        A.   We started our reverse engineering in 2004

17   and have the largest lab doing that, but that was in

18   2004. So we don't have the products back to the

19   time that this memo was written in 1973.

20        Q.   Uh-huh. You reviewed company documents,

21    didn't you?

22        A.   The company documents that I have reviewed

23   on product designs, I've had to sign confidentiality

24   agreements for because it's considered proprietary

25   information. 4994

1         Q.   Sir, isn't it true that you can find no

2   evidence in any of the materials that you reviewed,

3   including the internal documents of R.J. Reynolds

4   Tobacco Company, that Dr. Colby's recommendations

5   that were made in the memo that you discussed in

6   your direct examination were ever followed up on in

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=299
7   any way?

8             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

9             I would like a statement for the record

10        that R.J. Reynolds is releasing this witness

11         from any obligation of a confidentiality

12        agreement that has previously been imposed upon

13        him to allow him to freely answer that question

14        in its entirety.

15             THE COURT: Response.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have no idea what

17        Mr. Scarola is talking about. But if he makes

18        that representation, I am not in a position to

19        dispute it. I am just asking the gentleman

20        questions.

21              MR. SCAROLA: May we approach?

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: It's interrupting the

23        cross-examination.

24             THE COURT: The pending question is? 25

4995

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   The pending question is: In fact, based

3   upon your review of R.J. Reynolds' documents,

4   whether they were subject to a confidentiality

5   agreement or not, based upon the reverse engineering

6   work that you described to the ladies and gentlemen

7   of the jury, you have no evidence, do you, that

8   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company followed up in any way

9   on the suggestion that was made in the Colby

10   exhibit, Plaintiffs Exhibit 1233, that you

11    discussed with the jury yesterday?

12             MR. SCAROLA: And my request, your Honor,

13        is a clear statement from R.J. Reynolds that

14        this witness is released from any contractual

15        obligation R.J. Reynolds imposed upon him.

16             THE COURT: Let me ask --

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let's address this at

18        sidebar, I think, your Honor.

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: Well, first, I'd like to know

22        whether the question is even covered.

23        Shouldn't the witness answer the question as to

24        whether it's covered by confidentiality? If

25        it's not, it's a nonissue and we don't need to 4996

1        take it up. I think we should ask the witness

2        whether it's covered by confidentiality.

3             MR. SCAROLA: That's fine.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: This witness had

5        consulted with the company in connection with

6        the cigarettes that he did, but did not burn

7        tobacco. I do not intend to ask him questions

8        that would call for him to reveal confidential

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=300
9        information he may have learned as part of that

10        consultation. However, later, not in

11         connection with this question, but later, when

12        it comes to talking about the level of

13        cooperation that the company's gave -- engaged

14        with the public health community, I do intend

15        to elicit from him testimony that he, in fact,

16        consulted on that, but again, I do not intend

17        to get into proprietary information.

18             THE COURT: So you want a yes or no

19        whether --

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Whether the idea

21         expressed in Dr. Colby's memo --

22             THE COURT: Was followed up.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Followed up on, that's

24        right.

25             THE COURT: If the witness says it calls 4997

1        for disclosure --

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: It really doesn't. He

3        may say that, but it really doesn't.

4             MR. KELLY: I would suggest, since it's

5        almost lunch, dismiss the jury, find out what

6        he's going to say outside the presence of the

7        jury. If it's not within confidentiality, we

8        move on back.

9             THE COURT: Any preference how long we

10        break for lunch, keeping in mind I want to

11         finish with this witness today? How much

12        longer does R.J. think?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, he was on the

14        stand for almost two days.

15             THE COURT: I'm not limiting, I'm just

16        asking.

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think I can give you a

18        guess, maybe a better read after lunch, my

19        guess is I'm about halfway.

20             THE COURT: Is an hour too short for lunch

21         for everyone?

22             MR. SCAROLA: As long as Mr. Henk doesn't

23        have a variety of mistrial motions that consume

24        a significant portion of the hour, an hour is

25        fine. 4998

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4             THE COURT: Is the jury okay with just an

5        hour today?

6             Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going

7        to take our lunchtime break now. I would like

8        to ask -- is an hour sufficient time for lunch?

9        We'll do an hour today. We'll be back at 1:25.

10             Remember my important instruction not to

11         discuss the case with anyone, not to view any

12        media, should there be any media coverage you

13        come in contact with. No contact with anyone

14        associated with the case, and we'll be back at

15         1:25.

16             I'll remind our witness that you are under

17        oath, not to discuss your testimony with anyone

18        over the break, and we'll see you back at 1:25.

19        Thank you.

20             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

21         after which the following proceedings were

22        held:)

23             THE COURT: Okay. We'll spend a moment on

24        the issue that we just left off with.

25             Dr. Cummings, there was a question, the 4999

1        last pending question from counsel for

2        R.J. Reynolds regarding your review of the

3        Colby Exhibit 1233, whether there was any

4        evidence that R.J. Reynolds followed up on any

5        of the suggestions in this exhibit, and the

6        question is, in answering that question, which

7        may be a yes or a no, does that call for you to

8        disclose anything that you believe is covered

9        by this confidentiality agreement, and would

10        you like the question asked again so you can be

11         clear?

12             THE WITNESS: I can answer the question,

13        and the answer would be no. I can answer the

14        question without disclosing information.

15             THE COURT: Okay. So I'll permit counsel,

16        when we return, to ask that question. Was

17        there anything else you wanted to discuss in

18        that regard so we can get that cleared up as it

19        relates to confidentiality?

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't think I'm going

21         to ask him anything that would elicit

22        confidential information and that has not

23        already been asked of him in a public forum.

24             THE COURT: Okay. So with respect to that

25        question, I'll allow that question to be asked. 5000

1        Was there anything further on that topic?

2             MR. SCAROLA: Not directly on that topic,

3        but Mr. Biersteker seems to be going in a

4        direction that is attempting to develop good

5        company evidence, and to the extent that he is,

6        it is plaintiffs position that good company

7        evidence in this phase of the proceeding must

8        have some nexus to Charlie Piendle. In the

9        absence of that nexus, good company evidence,

10        that is evidence to indicate a lesser degree of

11         reprehensibility, is evidence that is second

12        stage, not first stage evidence. You don't get

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=302
13        into general good conduct until the second

14        phase. If it relates to Charlie Piendle, we

15        can get it in in the first phase.

16             THE COURT: Response.

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, that is

18        preposterous. These are the same exhibits that

19        the witness used. What's good for the goose is

20        good for the gander. If he wants to talk about

21         exhibits to suggest reprehensibility, which

22        your Honor allowed over objection based upon

23        the nexus issue, I am certainly entitled to

24        follow up on the very same exhibits in my

25        cross-examination to suggest that there was 5001

1         good company conduct.

2             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, the -

3             THE COURT: Just on that issue, I am not

4        going to make a ruling until there's a

5        particular question to which there's a

6        particular objection based on that issue.

7             MR. SCAROLA: I can give your Honor just a

8        broad example so we can place this in context.

9        If we are talking about some evidence about

10        disclosures the company made during the period

11         of time that Charlie Piendle was smoking, that

12        would tend to reduce reprehensibility of the

13        acts that have a nexus to Charlie Piendle. If

14        we're talking about changes in cigarette design

15        that occurred after Charlie Piendle stopped

16        smoking, that could have no nexus. If we're

17        talking about all these new products we're

18        trying to develop in the year 2010 that we

19        weren't trying to develop --

20             MR. SALES: In Sweden.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Sorry, in Sweden that we

22        weren't trying to develop prior to 1989, there

23        could be no nexus to Charlie Piendle. That's

24        just an illustration of the concern that I

25        have. 5002

1              MR. KELLY: Your Honor, it is my view, our

2        view, Philip Morris' view, that much of the

3        testimony that Dr. Cummings gave that postdated

4         1989, which in large part involved allegations

5        of the company's misconduct, in some instances

6        up to the current time, with respect to their

7        product design specifically, was objected to

8        when the question was asked and when the answer

9        was given on direct examination, and motions to

10        strike were made on the grounds that such

11         testimony violated Williams and State Farm and

12        had no nexus to Mr. Piendle.

13             Those objections were overruled and those

14        motions to strike were denied, and the

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=303
15        testimony came in before the jury.

16             It is only because the objections were

17        overruled and the motions were denied and the

18        jury was allowed to hear that evidence that

19        this same scope of information is going to be

20        covered on cross-examination.

21              If our objections had been sustained, if

22        the scope of the witness' testimony had been

23        restricted, as we believe it should have been,

24        only that conduct that caused harm to

25        Mr. Piendle, whatever that might have been, 5003

1        then there wouldn't be any necessity to ask

2        questions beyond 1989.

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4             MR. KELLY: So in light of that objection,

5        in light of that admission, admission now that

6        the evidence the plaintiffs adduced from this

7        witness on direct examination is irrelevant to

8        this phase of the case, we move for a mistrial,

9        your Honor.

10             Obviously, a due process violation of

11        Williams/State Farm. It's now admitted. It's

12        now admitted, your Honor. We knew they were

13        doing it improperly, and now it's been

14        admitted. We need a mistrial, your Honor.

15        This is an abuse of the system and violation of

16        our due process rights.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Would you like me to respond

18        to the mistrial motion?

19             THE COURT: Brief response.

20             MR. SCAROLA: Brief response is that every

21         element of proof adduced during the plaintiffs

22        case had a nexus to Charlie Piendle, including

23        that evidence as to conduct that occurred

24        subsequent to 1989, because that evidence was

25        evidence of the continuation of exactly the 5004

1         same kind of conduct that had caused harm to

2        Charlie Piendle.

3             Design of products after Charlie Piendle

4        stopped smoking in 1989 has no nexus to Charlie

5        Piendle. That's the important distinction. We

6        have, in fact, limited our testimony during

7        this phase to evidence that is relevant and

8        material to the reprehensibility of the conduct

9        that caused injury to Charlie Piendle and the

10        length of time that that very conduct

11         continued. And that's the important

12        distinction that I think counsel has

13        overlooked, your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Okay.

15             MR. SCAROLA: The basis upon which I

16        understood the Court was admitting that

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=304
17        evidence.

18             THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to deny the

19        motion for mistrial. I'll entertain objections

20        as they are raised with respect to evidence

21         elicited at any point, but particularly if

22        there is evidence elicited post 1989 that

23        plaintiff may believe is good conduct evidence,

24        I'll have to hear it, rule on it step by step.

25             Motion for mistrial denied, and we'll come 5005

1        back at 1:25.

2             MR. HENK: Your Honor, Philip Morris would

3        make a request that Mr. Scarola cease in front

4        of the jury offering things like a waiver of a

5        confidentiality provision. That is totally

6        inappropriate in any courtroom in the United

7        States to do that in front of a jury.

8        Mr. Scarola knows that.

9             Whenever I wanted to do anything in the

10        cross-examination of the plaintiff, he ran up

11         to the bench as quickly as he could, even

12        though Mr. Scarola wasn't on the witness, and

13        he was permitted to do it, and he's doing this

14        repeatedly in front of the jury, knowing that

15        it prejudices us. It's totally inappropriate.

16             I ask that he be instructed not to do it

17        anymore, and that the jury be instructed that

18        what Mr. Scarola did was inappropriate, and

19        they should disregard it.

20             THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to

21         instruct the jury on that, and I believe we

22        curtailed the discussion of the

23        confidentiality, and that's why we're having

24        our lunch break at this time, so we can discuss

25        it outside the hearing of the jury. 5006

1              MR. HENK: My request for an instruction

2        as to Mr. Scarola is denied?

3             THE COURT: We'll be in recess until 1:25.

4             Yes, that request is denied.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm sorry, what time,

6        your Honor?

7             THE COURT:  1:25.

8             (Thereupon, a lunch recess was had at

9         12:35 p.m., after which the proceedings

10        continued in Volume XXXII.) 11

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

16        A.   Good morning.

17        Q.   In the past, sir, you have described

18   yourself as anti-tobacco, have you not?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   In fact, you wrote an article entitled

21    "The War on Tobacco," true?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=309
22        A.   That's true.

23        Q.   And you have been referred to, at least by

24   the local paper up in Buffalo, as General Cummings,

25   right? 4868

1        A.   I guess I've been at it for a while.

2        Q.   As in the general on the war on tobacco,

3   right?

4        A.   They did use that title in an article that

5   characterized some of my work over the last 30

6   years.

7        Q.   You have spoken to thousands of people

8   about your war against tobacco in various settings;

9   isn't that true?

10        A.   Many thousands, yes.

11         Q.   And you have even advocated the banning of

12   cigarettes altogether.

13        A.   Combustion tobacco products, or taking the

14   nicotine out.

15        Q.   In fact, haven't you written that we are

16   50 years too late in terms of banning tobacco

17   combustion products after the Surgeon General's

18   reports came out in 1964?

19        A.   I think what I said is combustion tobacco

20   products that have nicotine.

21         Q.   You have also advocated thinking

22   creatively about ways to make the tobacco industry

23   less profitable, correct?

24        A.   That's correct.

25        Q.   And eliminating the profitability of the 4869

1   tobacco business altogether, true?

2        A.   That's right.

3        Q.   One way to make cigarette companies less

4   profitable would be to encourage them to sell

5   nicotine-replacement products like the nicotine gum

6   or the nicotine patch, true?

7        A.   I don't think that would make them less

8   profitable. It would make them more profitable,

9   since most customers would leave smoking if they

10   could.

11         Q.   You think that would be a good thing?

12        A.   Yes, absolutely.

13        Q.   Do you know whether or not an affiliate of

14   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has purchased a

15   Swedish company called Niconovum or an interest in

16   it, that makes alternative nicotine delivery systems

17   like gum and patches?

18        A.   And smokeless products. Yes, I am

19   familiar with that. They also run a company called

20   Targacept. I think a former research director, Don

21    DeBethizy, is the executive of that company. I'm

22   familiar with that.

23        Q.   And you would regard Targacept, the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=310
24   interest that an affiliate has in Niconovum, the

25   nicotine replacement company, as well as the 4870

1   marketing of smokeless tobacco products such as

2   Snus, right, as a good thing, wouldn't you?

3        A.   Well, I think Snus has a lot of problems,

4   particularly when there are much cleaner delivery

5   systems for nicotine, such as gum and lozenge, that

6   would be the preference, but certainly better than

7   selling cigarettes.

8        Q.   Okay. You have identified another

9   strategy for eliminating or reducing the

10   profitability of the tobacco business, and that is

11    to increase the cost of doing business by a

12   regulation in litigation, true?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And plaintiffs lawyers are involved at

15   least in part in that strategy, right?

16        A.   They are.

17        Q.   Plaintiffs expert witnesses like yourself

18   are also involved in that strategy?

19        A.   I've been asked to serve as an expert

20   witness and have been doing it for about 15 years.

21         Q.   Would you agree that you have a fairly

22   significant anti-tobacco bias on the issues in this

23   case?

24        A.   Well, I wouldn't call it a bias. I come

25   in and give truthful testimony about what I know 4871

1    about the effects of smoking, nicotine dependence,

2   my study of the business records, the research that

3   I've done on the products, the marketing. So what I

4   do is I come in and give truthful testimony.

5        Q.   You have taken your war against tobacco

6   into the courtroom, haven't you?

7        A.   I have served as an expert witness, yes.

8        Q.   Okay. And you have testified under oath

9   against tobacco companies more than 50 times?

10        A.   Yes. I've never been asked by a cigarette

11    company to come in and testify on their behalf.

12        Q.   Do you think it could be as many as a

13   hundred times?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   Somewhere between 50 and a hundred?

16        A.   It's about 50 times maybe, maybe more. I

17   haven't counted it all.

18        Q.   So many times you lost track of the

19   number?

20        A.   I just don't bother to count them up.

21    I've been doing this for 15 years, and when you say

22   testify, it includes deposition and trial testimony.

23   I've done about, you know, 25 trials or so.

24        Q.   About 25 trials?

25        A.   Yeah.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=311
4872

1         Q.   In fact, isn't it true that in the last

2   year alone, since I think roughly April of 2009, you

3   have testified in ten or more trials like this?

4        A.   No, not ten. I've done --1 think since

5   March, there were six trials that I've done.

6        Q.   Since March of 2009?

7        A.   2010.

8        Q.   2010. My question was 2009.

9        A.   Sorry.

10        Q.   Would you agree with me it's at least ten

11    times --

12        A.   Yeah.

13        Q.    since April -- let me finish the

14   question, I'm sorry -- since April of 2009?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   All right. Thank you.

17        A.   That's probably about right.

18        Q.   And a whole bunch of those trials have

19   been down here in Florida, right?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   Not limited to tobacco litigation, you

22   have been retained as an expert by plaintiffs

23   lawyers in more than 100 lawsuits throughout your

24   career?

25        A.   That, I don't know. I think I've been 4873

1   listed because I did a generic testimony here in

2   Florida on a lot of cases, and I've given my

3   permission for my generic testimony to be played.

4        Q.   I think you testified on direct

5   examination with Mr. Scarola that you charge $300

6   per hour for time that you spend testifying either

7   in a trial like this one or in deposition; is that

8   right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And $100 an hour in order to review

11    materials and to prepare your testimony?

12        A.   That's correct.

13        Q.   And that includes payment for your travel

14   time?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   Isn't it true that about more than half of

17   the money that you receive as a result of your

18   litigation work goes to you?

19        A.   That's right. Half of it goes to Roswell,

20   I've set up an account there. It goes to our

21    Roswell Park Alliance, which is our fundraising

22   organization for our cancer center.

23        Q.   And I think you mentioned to Mr. Scarola

24   on direct examination that 20 percent of your time

25   nowadays is devoted to tobacco litigation issues, is 4874

1   that -- did I remember that correctly?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=312
2        A.   Right, in 2010, because there had been

3   this whole host of cases that sort of came up. And

4   since March, I've done six trials. I think this is

5   the seventh trial.

6        Q.   And I don't know if I heard it or not, but

7   would you -- what percentage of your income would

8   that 20 percent of the time nowadays represent?

9        A.   Well, my income is 180,000 a year. I'm a

10   senior scientist, been at Roswell 30 years. So

11    that's my salary at Roswell. So it's about

12   20 percent of that.

13        Q.   So Roswell pays you at approximately the

14   same rate that you charge when you testify in

15   litigation and prepare for litigation?

16        A.   Yeah. Roughly. My fees are pretty much

17   set to the fees that I charge for consulting.

18        Q.   Okay. You were a participant in a

19   workshop in media training conducted, I think, by an

20   outfit called The Advocacy Institute back in, I

21    think, 1988.

22        A.   I attended a conference at the National

23   Cancer Institute, and The Advocacy Institute I think

24   helped organize that for the National Cancer

25   Institute. 4875

1         Q.   Okay. And the workshop brought together

2   experts like yourself in order to discuss how to

3   frame issues concerning smoking and health; is that

4   fair?

5        A.   It was basically to talk about how to give

6   interviews, because The Tobacco Institute used

7   professionals to do interviews, and doctors and

8   scientists were no match really for the experts in

9   public relations. So really what they did is

10   brought in some people who were expert in public

11    relations and talked and gave advice on how to teach

12   people to do these interviews.

13        Q.   And that training would have applicability

14   in courtrooms too in terms of helping you respond to

15   questions that may get asked here.

16        A.   No. I mean, it was about doing media

17   interviews, I think it was about media advocacy,

18   which was just a way of talking about public

19   relations activities to try to get the word out

20   about the dangers of smoking.

21         Q.   Uh-huh. The workshop also covered a topic

22   called creating a controversy, didn't it?

23        A.   It was back in the '80s, there was a

24   booklet that was produced based on the proceedings

25   of that meeting. It might have. 4876

1         Q.   Well, let me see if I can read an excerpt

2   to you and see if it refreshes your recollection.

3        A.   Sure.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=313
4        Q.   Do you recall that according to the

5   workshop --

6             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. I

7        object to reading from a document that has not

8        been marked and is not an exhibit in evidence.

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: I mean, I can show him

10        the transcript of his own prior testimony if

11         that helps.

12             MR. SCAROLA: All I am requesting

13        your Honor, is that the rule of evidence be

14        complied with, and that prohibits reading from

15        a document that has not been marked and not

16        been admitted.

17             It may be, when we see it, that if it's

18        properly listed and it's relevant and material,

19        we'll have no objection. I'm only asking that

20        the rules be complied with.

21              THE COURT: Do you have a transcript to

22        refresh the witness' recollection?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, your Honor.

24             THE COURT: So is there something you want

25        to show him? 4877

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, I'd like to have the

2        Gray transcript from January 26th, 2010, in the

3        afternoon.

4             THE COURT: All right. Why don't we give

5        that to the witness then.

6             MR. SCAROLA: May I also request of

7        counsel that we have a copy?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, absolutely. I will

9        do it every time. It just takes me a minute.

10             May I approach?

11              THE COURT: Yes.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, would you

13        like a copy?

14             THE COURT: Yes.

15     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

16        Q.   And let me give you the page. It would be

17   page 1116. And if I could direct your attention to

18   line 7 to 19.

19        A.   Of course.

20        Q.   Now, if you could just read that question,

21    Doctor, to yourself, and then I'll ask a question

22   when you are finished.

23        A.   Okay. I've read it.

24        Q.   Do you recall that one of the topics

25   covered in The Advocacy Institute's seminar in 1988 4878

1   was creating controversy?

2        A.   Well, it was a workshop, and -- yeah.

3        Q.   Okay. And one of the examples that was

4   discussed about how to create a controversy would be

5   to, for example, film -- send kids into convenience

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=314
6   stores and film them when they're underage buying

7   cigarettes, right?

8        A.   That's right. Back at the time that that

9   conference was held, just about anybody could go

10   into a store and buy cigarettes. So they talked

11    about doing that, and they said, well, because of

12   the media aspect of it, perhaps you could actually

13   film it, the kids going in and buying the

14   cigarettes, to show how easy it was for underage

15   individuals to get cigarettes.

16        Q.   Right. And to make it newsworthy and to

17   gain publicity, right?

18        A.   Yes. I mean, to get the message out and,

19   essentially, the message then was, why aren't we

20   enforcing the laws about minors' access to

21    cigarettes. It was quite effective in changing the

22   behavior of retailers, actually, so they are less

23   likely today to sell cigarettes to minors.

24        Q.   Now, you actually put creating controversy

25   into practice, haven't you? 4879

1        A.   Yeah. I actually have done some of these

2   studies in the Buffalo area about sending kids into

3   stores to document how easy it was for kids to buy

4   cigarettes, and we did have a film crew at one point

5   go along with the police officer from the local

6   community as they went around, and I think my son at

7   the time was 12, and went in and was mic'd up to

8   hear the interaction between the clerk and him, and

9   he was able to buy cigarettes, I think, in nine out

10   of ten of the stores.

11         Q.I actually have a somewhat different

12   example in mind. You discussed with the jury

13   yesterday Plaintiffs Exhibit 1433, which was a

14   letter in 1990 from Reynolds to Willow Park

15   Elementary School in Amherst, New York.

16        A.   Willow Ridge.

17        Q.   Willow Ridge, excuse me. I'd like to talk

18   to you a little bit about that.

19        A.   Sure.

20        Q.   That Willow Ridge is -- the school, the

21    elementary school is located in a suburb near

22   Buffalo where you live, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   As I recall, in 1990, a nurse invited you

25   to come give a lecture to the fifth graders at the 4880

1    elementary school, right?

2        A.   Yes, Beth Shipe.

3        Q.   And you're the one who encouraged the

4   students to write a letter to the tobacco companies?

5        A.   Actually, I asked the teacher when I went

6   in what were the students learning at the time, and

7   she told me that they were learning how to write

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=315
8   business letters. So I suggested writing the

9   business letters to the cigarette companies about

10   the brand logos that appeared on toys and candy

11   products and video games at the time, and the

12   students did that because my lecture had talked

13   about the health effects of smoking and some of the

14   marketing of tobacco products, and I lectured to

15   that school because I was invited in, and I do many

16   schools in the area because I work at a cancer

17   center, and that's one of the services that our

18   center provides to the local community.

19        Q.   Okay. So the answer is, you encouraged or

20   suggested that the students write to the tobacco

21    companies?

22        A.   I did.

23        Q.   Let's take this in bite size. The letters

24   were sent to all tobacco companies, not just my

25   client, R.J. Reynolds, right? 4881

1        A.   I don't know.

2        Q.   You do know that R.J. Reynolds is the only

3   company that gave the courtesy of a response?

4        A.   That's correct.

5        Q.   And the response was to the principal of

6   the school, not directly to the students, right?

7        A.   It was.

8        Q.   And the nurse gave you a copy of a letter

9   that had been sent to the principal, right?

10        A.   That's correct.

11         Q.   And now you use it as an exhibit in trials

12   all around the country, right?

13        A.   Well, it's --1 do, and I certainly

14   brought it along as an exhibit. It was never

15   intended to be an exhibit. I mean, I had no clue

16   that I would ever be an expert witness in a tobacco

17   case in 1990 when I had gone in to talk to the fifth

18   graders and received the call from the nurse about

19   the letter.

20        Q.   I think, as you said, the fifth graders

21    were learning how to write business letters as part

22   of their classwork, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And one of the things that you suggested

25   that they write to the tobacco companies about was 4882

1   the use of logos or trademarks on toys and candy

2   cigarettes, right?

3        A.   And video games.

4        Q.   And video games, okay. Is trademark

5   infringement a topic that you learned about in the

6   fifth grade?

7        A.   No.

8        Q.   Okay. In fact, R.J. Reynolds has never

9   sold candy cigarettes, has it?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=316
10        A.   No.

11         Q.   Never sold toys?

12        A.   No.

13        Q.   Never sold video games?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   From your research, you know, don't you,

16   that Reynolds has had a consistent policy against

17   the use of its trademarks on products directed to

18   children, such as toys, video games, and candy?

19        A.   Well, all I know is that, at the time, I

20   had pictures of toys, candy tobacco products, and

21    video games that had logos for Reynolds products, as

22   well as Philip Morris products, and I shared those

23   with the students and this was the letter that came

24   back.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that sometimes manufacturers 4883

1    of products, such as candy or toys, will use the

2   trademark of one of the tobacco companies without

3   permission?

4        A.   I don't know how it happens, but you go to

5   the toy aisle and it was very common to see toys,

6   motorcycles with Camel logos on it, racecars with

7   Marlboro logos, Atari Grand Prix racing had images

8   of Marlboro in it. I have, in the past, written

9   letters to the companies to alert them to the fact

10   that their logos were showing up in these games and

11    on products that are aimed at children.

12        Q.   During your review of the historical

13   documents that you talk about and that you have seen

14   during the course of your testimony in cases like

15   this one, isn't it true that Reynolds' in-house

16   lawyers will contact the manufacturers of children's

17   products to demand that they stop using Reynolds'

18   trademarks on candy and toys and video games

19   intended for kids?

20        A.   I have seen those, yeah.

21         Q.   You have seen those?

22        A.   Yeah.

23        Q.   Okay. Are you aware that Reynolds has

24   gone so far as to sue manufacturers of children's

25   products who use their trademarks, Reynolds' 4884

1   trademarks on products for children?

2        A.   I'm not familiar with that.

3        Q.   That's not something you investigated?

4        A.   I'm not familiar with any lawsuits. I'd

5   be happy to come in and testify on your behalf. I

6   think it's wrong that they use their trademarks on

7   toys, candy products, and video games.

8        Q.   Would you dispute that R.J. Reynolds

9   Tobacco Company actively seeks to prevent candy

10   cigarette manufacturers from using Reynolds'

11    trademarks, for example?

12             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. May

13        we have a time frame for this question?

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Certainly. The 1980s, and certainly at

16   the time that the letter was written from Willow

17   Ridge Elementary School in 1990.

18        A.   In 1990, I'm familiar with responses I've

19   gotten back when I've written to the companies that

20   they would go up and ask the owner of the store to

21    remove --1 think it was Atari Grand Prix racing,

22   which was at a children's mini golf -- miniature

23   golf setup where they had the games, and I had taken

24   down the serial number and they said they would

25   remove the logos on that machine and any other 4885

1   machine that I would locate, one by one.

2        Q.   Now, let's go back to the exhibit that you

3   used with the jury. Let me get the number right, PT

4    1433. That letter was dated, as I recall,

5   January 11th, 1990, right?

6        A.   That's right.

7        Q.   At that time, Mr. Piendle would have been

8   how old?

9        A.   He was dead at that point.

10        Q.   1990? Are you sure about that?

11         A.   No, I'm sorry. He had quit smoking in

12    1989, so he was born in 1941, so he would have

13   been --

14        Q.   48 or 49 years old?

15        A.   Right.

16        Q.   And as you point out, he hadn't quit

17   smoking by that point, right?

18        A.   That's right. He quit in'89.

19        Q.   Now, you showed the jury the first

20   paragraph of the letter after you suggested --

21    relating to your suggestion that the students write

22   to the company about logos that were appearing on

23   candy cigarettes and other products, but there's

24   another paragraph that I'd like to draw to your

25   attention. 4886

1        A.   Sure.

2        Q.   And if we look at the first -- the second

3   paragraph here, and I'll just read it. "As

4   information, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's policy

5   is not to allow our brand names to be used on toys

6   or candy cigarettes, and any current use of our

7   brand names in this fashion is not sanctioned by our

8   company." You did not read that portion of the

9   letter to the jury, did you?

10        A.   No, I did not read that portion.

11         Q.   And the next paragraph, third paragraph,

12   "Advise the principal of the school that the tobacco

13   industry considers smoking to be a custom for those

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=318
14   adults who drive pleasure from it." You see that?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   You didn't read that to the jury either,

17   did you?

18        A.   No.

19        Q.   In Reynolds' response, you read the

20   portion that noted that some of the students also

21    commented about the controversies surrounding

22   cigarette smoking. Do you remember reading that a

23   bit?

24        A.   Some of the students?

25        Q.   Yes, some of the Reynolds' letters said, 4887

1    and some of the students raised in their letters to

2   the company the controversy surrounding cigarette

3   smoking. Do you remember reading that sentence?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   Is that another topic that you suggested

6   students mention in their letter?

7        A.   No.

8        Q.   You told them about smoking and health,

9   didn't you, during the course of your presentation

10   to them?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   Did you tell them about the tobacco

13   industry's position on smoking and health in your

14   letter to them -- in your discussions to them?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And then you suggested that they write a

17   letter to the tobacco companies?

18        A.   Actually, I suggested it to the teacher.

19        Q.   You suggested it to the teacher, fine,

20   thanks.

21              Isn't it true that there are about

22   60 million pages of tobacco company internal

23   documents that are publicly available today?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   And I think you said that you have about 4888

1    16 million pages of those tobacco industry documents

2   at your Roswell Park facility; did I get that right?

3        A.   No.

4        Q.   No, okay. How many --1 thought you

5   received 16 million pages of documents relating to

6   CTR and TIRC and TI?

7        A.   No. I received the holdings from the

8   Council for Tobacco Research and The Tobacco

9   Institute that amounted to 16 million pages, plus

10   about 3,000 videotapes and audiotapes, but at our

11    institution, we have a server, we have all

12   60 million pages that we run on a server that is

13   available publicly.

14             We designed some ways for people to be

15   able to search the documents more easily across all

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=319
16   of the companies and all of the material, like going

17   to a library, and I have hired librarians to come in

18   and educate me about how to literally create a

19   virtual card catalog, making it possible to do the

20   searching on the documents.

21             We OCR'd, optical scan recognition, the

22   documents so keywords can be identified. So if you

23   type in a word like "Marlboro" or "Camel" or

24   whatever, it would bring up all the materials with

25   that word on the scanned documents. So it 4889

1   facilitates the searching process, and that's on the

2   servers at Roswell.

3        Q.   It could be on servers elsewhere too,

4   right?

5        A.   I think University of California,

6   San Francisco and, of course, the companies have put

7   their individual files up online as well and have

8   their own servers.

9        Q.   Isn't it true that you received over

10   $9 million in order to digitize and to research the

11    16 million pages of documents that you received?

12        A.   No, I don't think it's been that much, but

13   I did receive four or five grants that facilitated

14   not only the digitizing of the material and

15   organizing and indexing, but also research based on

16   the documents, and I'm not sure if it totals

17   9 million. I don't think it's 9 million.

18        Q.   You wouldn't dispute that it's millions,

19   would you?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   And certain of the documents that you

22   reviewed as part of that process are used in your

23   testimony with the court, like you used here, right?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   A portion of the money you received in 4890

1    order to digitize and research these documents came

2   from an outfit called the American Legacy Foundation

3   for tobacco document collections through an access

4   of scanning the documents, using the database?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   And that foundation helped provide you

7   resources to do the -- or to create digital images

8   of the documents and to research some of the

9    16 million that you have received, right?

10        A.   That's correct.

11         Q.   Now, the American Legacy Foundation

12   found -- funds, rather, antismoking and

13   anticigarette advertising campaigns, doesn't it?

14        A.   Right. They were created as part of the

15   master settlement to do that.

16        Q.   In fact, one of the ads that the American

17   Legacy Foundation created was one where a truckful

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=320
18   of body bags pulls up in front of Philip Morris'

19   headquarters and they start dumping the bodies out

20   on the sidewalk, right?

21         A.   Part of the truth campaign.

22        Q.   Part of the truth campaign.

23             Now, you were also provided resources in

24   order to do your document review and digitizing work

25   from an organization called the Flight Attendant 4891

1   Medical Research Institute, FAMRI?

2        A.   FAMRI, yes.

3        Q.   And FAMRI was something that was created

4   as a result of a class action suit called Broin,

5   right?

6        A.   That's correct.

7        Q.   And it was brought on behalf -- that suit

8   had been brought on behalf of flight attendants,

9   right?

10        A.   That's right, for secondhand smoke

11    exposure.

12        Q.   And you were on FAMRI's medical advisory

13   board for a time, right?

14        A.   I was, for about five years.

15        Q.   And, in fact, you talked, I think, in

16   response to Mr. Scarola about how you had testified

17   in some cases for free, you didn't charge, right?

18        A.   That's right.

19        Q.   And the case on behalf of the flight

20   attendants was one of those cases, right?

21         A.   It was.

22        Q.   In addition to testifying, you have also

23   appeared at seminars as a resource to attorneys who

24   are learning how to sue the tobacco industry, true?

25        A.   I've given lectures to many groups, 4892

1    attorneys, prisoners in prison, to school children,

2   to anyone who will listen.

3        Q.   For example, you participated in a

4   conference in Boston in 2002, didn't you?

5        A.   I did. I was invited by

6   Professor Daynard, who is a law professor at

7   Northeastern University to give talks on some of the

8   document collections that had come to Roswell Park.

9        Q.   The purpose of the conference was for

10   plaintiffs' lawyers to learn how to win lawsuits

11    against tobacco companies, wasn't it?

12        A.   Yes, the purpose, it was primarily for

13   lawyers learning about the litigation that was going

14   on against the tobacco companies.

15        Q.   In fact, Doctor, wasn't the title of the

16   conference, "How to Win a Just Tobacco Verdict"?

17        A.   I believe that was the title.

18        Q.   Okay. And by "just tobacco verdict," at

19   least in the eyes of the people who participated,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=321
20   that would be a plaintiffs verdict, true?

21         A.   Yes, I would --1 would say that.

22        Q.   And the conference up in Boston wasn't

23   open to just any attorney, was it?

24        A.   No, it was open to anybody who was willing

25   to sign the agreement to come to the conference. 4893

1         Q.   All right. Well, let's talk about that

2   for a minute. The conference was for plaintiffs'

3   attorneys and for witnesses working with plaintiffs'

4   attorneys, wasn't it?

5        A.   I don't believe it was for witnesses. I

6   was asked to come give a talk. It was primarily for

7   law students and attorneys to come learn about the

8   litigation activities going on.

9        Q.   To attend the conference, isn't it true

10   that you had to sign an affidavit stating that you

11    did not and would not work for a tobacco company in

12   litigation?

13        A.   Right. So anybody could go, you could

14   have gone, you could have signed that affidavit.

15        Q.   Okay. Let's switch gears for a minute and

16   talk about nicotine.

17        A.   Sure.

18        Q.   You would agree it has been known for

19   literally hundreds of years that cigarette smoking

20   can be difficult to quit, wouldn't you?

21         A.   I think smokers figure it out after they

22   try to quit and find that it's hard to quit, and I

23   would say that's probably been known for a lot of

24   years.

25        Q.   You don't disagree with the notion that 4894

1   it's been known for hundreds of years that once you

2   start smoking, it could be hard to quit, right?

3        A.   No. Hundreds of years, I'm not sure about

4   that. I mean, really, the inhalable cigarette

5   really didn't come about until the early 1900s.

6        Q.   A long time, Doctor?

7        A.   A long time, I'll agree with that. I'll

8   give you that.

9        Q.   Since before Mr. Piendle started smoking

10   in the 1950s?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   In fact, even -- well, before the 1964

13   Surgeon General's report, isn't it true that

14   laypeople used to describe smoking as an addiction

15   or addictive?

16        A.   Yes, I've seen reference to smoking talked

17   about as an addiction.

18        Q.   You have seen the Florida Health Notes,

19   which was a publication of the Florida Board of

20   Health in at least the trials; have you not?

21         A.   Primarily at trials.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=322
22        Q.   And isn't it true that in 1906 --1 can

23   show you the document. If you need it, let me know.

24   In 1906, the Florida State Board of Health

25   determined that, "Today, the cigarette is looked 4895

1   upon by all smokers" --

2             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor.

3        Again, a document should not be read from

4        unless and until it's properly marked,

5        identified, shown to opposing counsel, and

6        admitted into evidence.

7             THE COURT: Is there a document you would

8        like to show?

9             MR. BIERSTEKER: If the witness can

10        remember. It's going to slow this down if I

11         have to get it out every time and he has got,

12        as you can see, a fairly good command of his

13        materials.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry.

15             THE COURT: Can you ask the question

16        without referring to the content of the

17        document first?

18             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sure.

19     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

20        Q.   You're familiar with the publication of

21    the Florida State Board of Health called Florida

22   Health Notes from 1906, you've seen it, correct?

23        A.   I've seen it, but it would be useful to

24   have for my recollection.

25        Q.   Let me just give you a copy of defense 4896

1   AHL32.

2             If I may approach, your Honor. Would

3   your Honor like a copy?

4             THE COURT: That's okay.

5        A.   Thank you.

6             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. This

7        is just two pages from a very lengthy document,

8        and I would like, if counsel has it available

9        and is intending to offer any portion of it

10        into evidence, I would like to see the entire

11         document.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm just going to ask him

13        a question.

14             THE COURT: I don't think it needs to come

15        into evidence now, but let's hear what the next

16        question is first.

17     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

18        Q.   Doctor, can you look at the second page of

19   this exhibit, which I think is numbered ten at the

20   top?

21         A.   Sure.

22        Q.   Okay. And let me just ask you a couple of

23   questions. You recognize this as the Florida Health

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=323
24   Notes from 1906, right?

25        A.   Yes. 4897

1         Q.   Okay. You've seen it before, yes?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Isn't it true that on page 2 of this

4   exhibit, in 1906 -

5             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

6        That's exactly what counsel cannot do. He may

7        not read from a document, nor refer to the

8        contents of a document that has not been

9        admitted into evidence.

10             THE COURT: Can you ask the question

11         without referring to the content of the

12        document?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sure.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Isn't it true that the Florida Health

16   Notes recognized --

17             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. That

18        predicate clearly is attempting to do what

19        counsel knows he is not permitted to do.

20             THE COURT: Sustained.

21      BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

22        Q.   Doctor, the State of Florida, near the

23   turn of the last century in 1906, used the term

24   "addiction" to describe --

25             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. If I 4898

1        may. A question about what somebody else said,

2        particularly where no speaker is identified,

3        calls for hearsay and secondhand knowledge

4        unless a predicate is laid for the introduction

5        through some exception to the hearsay rule of

6        that statement, that has not been done, I do

7        object.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, it's not

9        being offered for the truth of the matter

10        asserted. It goes to public awareness, the

11         fact the State of Florida said what it said in

12         1906.

13             THE COURT: Can you bring the question as

14        to what the witness' understanding of, I guess,

15        public awareness, if that's the question.

16     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

17        Q.   Isn't it true that based on the

18   information that was available in 1906, the Florida

19   State Board of Health characterized smoking --

20             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. Same

21         objection, same question.

22             THE COURT: Counsel approach.

23             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

24        held out of the presence of the jury:)

25             THE COURT: If the question is this

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=324
4899

1        witness' understanding of what public awareness

2        was, can you just frame the question that way

3        without --

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: I want to be able to

5        direct it to very specific things. This is

6        cross-examination, and I'm perfectly entitled

7        to do this. This document is not being used

8        for hearsay purposes. I think the objections

9        being asserted are ill-founded.

10             THE COURT: What is the basis for relying

11         on the document? What is --

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is just to establish

13        public awareness. You know, he was -- he was

14        able to use --

15             THE COURT: So it would be for the truth?

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: No.

17             THE COURT: That this was out or that this

18        was out in the public domain?

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, yes.

20             THE COURT: Isn't it true - are you

21         seeking to ask him, isn't it true this document

22        was in the public arena?

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is true, yes.

24             THE COURT: What is the objection to that?

25             MR. SCAROLA: This is a document that is 4900

1         dated in 1906. There can be no nexus

2        established between this document and Charlie

3        Piendle. The document is hearsay unless and

4        until an appropriate predicate is laid as an

5        exception to the hearsay rule. It cannot be

6        admitted, and unless and until a predicate is

7        made or appropriate exception to the hearsay

8        rule, all of its contents should not be

9        referenced through any witness.

10             THE COURT: What is contained in it? What

11         is in the health notes? What is being argued

12        was in the public domain?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: He has already testified,

14        your Honor, that it's been known for hundreds

15        of years that smoking can be difficult to quit.

16        This is an example of -- or at least a very

17        long time. This is an example of the statement

18        in 1906 from the Florida Board of Health

19        recognizing that smoking is an addiction, okay.

20        He was able to use Tobacco Company documents

21         that talked about the importance of nicotine

22        and smoking, we objected, had no nexus to

23        Mr. Piendle.

24             THE COURT: Didn't he already testify that

25        it has been for a long time? You didn't get 4901

1        him to say a hundred years that it's been known

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=325
2        that nicotine --

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: It existed for a hundred

4        years and been a long time. I want to take him

5        back --

6             THE COURT: To impeach.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Not to impeach. I want

8        to say in 1906, the State of Florida

9        characterized cigarette smoking as an addiction

10        and it's the worst form of addiction, I believe

11         is the language. That's all I want to do. And

12        it is not -- it is not, respectfully,

13        Mr. Scarola, hearsay.

14             MR. KELLY: It's not hearsay. The only

15        foundation that needs to be laid on this

16        witness on cross-examination, is it fair when

17        you gave your testimony on direct that people

18        didn't know.

19             MR. SCAROLA: There is no predicate that

20        this document ever received any public

21         attention, any public attention, and unless and

22        until there is some predicate laid that it

23        received some public attention.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm

25        interrupting, I didn't mean to. 4902

1              MR. SCAROLA: Unless there's some

2        predicate laid that it received some public

3        attention that spilled over into the 1950s,

4        '60s, '70s, or '80s, it could not have any

5        relevance because it doesn't have any nexus.

6        Contrary to counsel's assertion, the witness

7        did not acknowledge a hundred years. What the

8        witness refused to acknowledge was that the

9        addictive properties of nicotine were

10        recognized for hundreds of years, he said since

11         the turn of the century.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let me follow up. There

13        was testimony on direct examination how

14        concealment of information by the tobacco

15        industry made a huge difference to public

16        health authorities.

17             I submit, your Honor, the Florida State

18        Board of Health is one of those authorities.

19        I'm entitled to explore with the witness

20        whether or not he was aware, in 1906, they said

21         what they said.

22             THE COURT: I'm going to allow the

23        question, not the content. If on redirect you

24        want to explore whether it was public knowledge

25        or not, you can explore it on redirect. 4903

1              MR. SCAROLA: We'd like to see a copy of

2        the entire document, the entire Florida Health

4             THE COURT: Do you have it?

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have it somewhere.

6             THE COURT: Before redirect?

7             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, before redirect.

8             THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

9             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

10        concluded and the following proceedings were

11         held within the presence of the jury:)

12     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

13        Q.   Doctor, when you testified yesterday about

14   the information that was available to the public

15   health community regarding addiction, were you aware

16   of the Florida Health Notes from 1906?

17        A.   I wouldn't have considered the Florida

18   Health Notes, which were referencing not something

19   from the Department of Health, but a statement from

20   somebody that got published in their notes, but I've

21    seen this only at trial brought by defendants in the

22   case. It's not something that I was aware of that

23   public health officials were utilizing as evidence.

24   It's not really evidence, it's a commentary.

25        Q.   Let me ask you, this was a publication of 4904

1   the Florida State Board of Health; was it not?

2        A.   It was contained in that Board of Health

3   statement, but it's not the evidence that I was

4   referring to as what the scientific community relied

5   on. I don't believe it's been cited in Surgeon

6   General's report or is among the 80,000 references

7   that are contained on smoking and health in the

8   Office on Smoking and Health CDC database on smoking

9   and health.

10        Q.   Simple question, Doctor: Were you aware,

11    when you gave your testimony over the course of the

12   last two days, that the Florida State Board of

13   Health, in 1906, had characterized smoking as an

14   addiction?

15        A.   I don't believe the Board of Health

16   characterized it. I believe it was an article that

17   was contained in their notes, and I've seen it only

18   at trial presented once to me, I believe.

19        Q.   In the official bulletin of the Florida

20   State Board of Health, right?

21         A.   It was in that bulletin, I believe, yes.

22        Q.   That was over a hundred years ago, right,

23    1906?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   The notion that -- the fact that 4905

1    cigarettes, tobacco cigarettes contain nicotine has

2   also been known for a long time, true?

3        A.   The fact that tobacco contains nicotine,

4   yes.

5        Q.   And including the tobacco in cigarettes,

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=327
6   right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Terms like "nicotine fiend" and "little

9   white slaver" date back to the early 1900s in this

10   country, don't they?

11         A.   Yes, they do.

12        Q.   You mentioned the Surgeon General's report

13   in 1988 during the course of your direct testimony,

14   remember that?

15        A.   I did. I reviewed that report, actually,

16   as one of the experts.

17        Q.   Again, I can show you an excerpt if you

18   like, but let me just ask a question, see if you're

19   able to answer it without having to review it.

20   Isn't it true that as early as the 1920s and '30s,

21    the Surgeon General's report in 1988 observed and

22   that some investigators were concluding that

23   nicotine was responsible for the compulsive use of

24   tobacco products, remember that?

25        A.   Yes, they did a review of the history of 4906

1   nicotine in tobacco, that was the subject of the

2   report.

3        Q.   Okay. Isn't it true that in the 1930s,

4   '40s, and '50s, Reader's Digest was the number one

5   publication in the country?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   And Reader's Digest went into hundreds of

8   thousands of households across the country, right?

9        A.   It did.

10        Q.   Reader's Digest published articles in the

11    1930s, '40s and '50s that identified nicotine as one

12   of the reasons that people smoke, right?

13        A.   It published a handful of articles that

14   talked about nicotine as one of the reasons that

15   people smoke, and a handful of articles on smoking

16   and health, out of the tens of thousands of articles

17   that appeared in Reader's Digest.

18        Q.   You don't dispute that Reader's Digest in

19   the 1930s, '40s and '50s sometimes referred to

20   nicotine as a drug, do you?

21         A.   No, I don't dispute that.

22        Q.   And those articles reported that people

23   could be addicted to nicotine, didn't they?

24        A.   They did say that.

25        Q.   And all these Reader's Digest articles 4907

1   weren't written for scientists, were they?

2        A.   No.

3        Q.   They were written for the general public?

4        A.   That's correct.

5        Q.   And as the number one publication in the

6   United States at the time, those articles weren't

7   using terminology that ordinary people couldn't

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=328
8   understand, were they?

9        A.   What time?

10        Q.   In the 1930s, '40s and '50s.

11         A.   Well, in the 1950s, I think True Magazine

12   was actually one of the most popular magazines among

13   men.

14        Q.   Did I ask you about True Magazine, Doctor?

15        A.   You said the most popular magazine. I

16   think Reader's Digest's popularity began to decline.

17        Q.   Are you confident that Reader's Digest got

18   eclipsed by some other magazine as the number one

19   magazine in the country?

20        A.   Not totally confident. That's why I was

21    asking.

22        Q.   Let me ask the question again. I'm not

23   sure if you answered it. I got distracted when you

24   mentioned a different magazine.

25             Isn't it true that the Reader's Digest 4908

1    articles that appeared in the 1930s, '40s and '50s

2   were using terminology that ordinary people could

3   understand?

4        A.   Sure. I mean, it was written so people

5   could -- they were articles for the general public,

6   so they used words that people could understand, and

7   they often covered topics related to smoking and

8   health and tried to present it in a way that the

9   layperson could understand it.

10        Q.   I think one of the exhibits that you

11    talked about over the course of your direct

12   testimony was a document written by a Claude Teague

13   in 1972, Plaintiffs Exhibit PT-1920. Do you

14   remember that?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And I believe that Mr. Teague in that

17   document referred to nicotine as the sine qua non;

18   remember that phrase?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   And that sort of means without which

21    nothing?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   So that nicotine was basically essential

24   to smoking; do you remember that?

25        A.   That's correct. 4909

1         Q.   Isn't it true that Reader's Digest said

2   the same thing about 20 years earlier?

3        A.   Used that terminology?

4        Q.   Yeah, described nicotine as the essential

5   ingredient of tobacco.

6        A.   I don't recall that, but I don't dispute

7   that something like that might have been stated in

8   one of the articles.

9        Q.   Well, let me just ask, isn't it true that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=329
10   the notion that a cigarette is a delivery system for

11    nicotine was not a novel idea in the 1950s?

12        A.   Right, any tobacco product that contained

13   nicotine was a delivery system for nicotine.

14        Q.   In fact, the 1988 Surgeon General's report

15   references a 1942 article by a scientist named

16   Johnston. Do you remember that one? You've seen it

17   before, I know.

18        A.   The Lancet paper, I believe.

19        Q.   Yeah, the Lancet paper.

20             Again, I can show it to you if you wish.

21    Let me know at any time.

22        A.   It would be useful to refresh my memory if

23   you want to talk about it.

24        Q.   Let's get the Surgeon General's report,

25   Defense Exhibit AS34, the 1988 Surgeon General's 4910

1   report.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach, again?

3             THE COURT: You may.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

5     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

6        Q.   And if you'll turn to page 10,1 believe.

7   Yes, the bottom of the first full paragraph on the

8   page, Doctor.

9        A.   Okay.

10        Q.   If you could read that to yourself, and

11    then I'll ask you a question.

12        A.   Okay.

13        Q.   Do you recall, as reported in the 1988

14   Surgeon General's report --

15             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. I'm

16        sorry. If there's going to be a reference to

17        the contents of this document, it should be

18        admitted into evidence. I have absolutely no

19        objection to it being admitted into evidence,

20        but there should be no reference to what the

21         document says unless and until it's admitted.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm only going to ask him

23        if he recalls what Dr. Johnston said in his

24         1942 article, as reflected in the Surgeon

25        General's report that he reviewed. 4911

1              MR. SCAROLA: I'm not objecting to it

2        being admitted. It can come in, but until it

3        comes in, we shouldn't be talking about what's

4        in the document.

5             THE COURT: Is there an objection to it

6        being admitted into evidence?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, he relied

8        upon it as a part of his direct examination. I

9        think I'm entitled to ask him questions based

10        on it.

11              THE COURT: You don't want to move it in?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=330
12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Well, it has not yet been

13        moved into evidence, and it is my understanding

14        that at least during plaintiffs case, I wasn't

15        supposed to be moving stuff into evidence.

16        They objected yesterday with respect to some

17        other matters.

18             THE COURT: Let me have counsel approach.

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: If the expert relied upon the

22        document in rendering his opinion, counsel

23        should be able to explore.

24             MR. KELLY: Say it again.

25             THE COURT: If counsel relied on this in 4912

1        rendering his opinion on certain documents,

2        then counsel should be able to ask him about

3        those documents that he reviewed.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I absolutely agree.

5             THE COURT: I don't know they need to be

6        in evidence to ask him about documents he

7        relied upon in rendering his opinion.

8             MR. SCAROLA: Respectfully, I think the

9        fact that -- his reliance does permit the

10        document to be admitted into evidence, but

11         until it's admitted into evidence, the contents

12        of the document should not be referenced,

13        that's plaintiffs position. I have no

14        objection to it coming in.

15             THE COURT: Just to clear up, does defense

16        object to it coming in?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't object to it

18        coming in. Plaintiffs are putting up as

19        demonstrative exhibits all sorts of things that

20        weren't in evidence, including the Fagerstrom

21         test that was a demonstrative that they had

22        Mrs. Piendle fill out on the stand, and that is

23        absurd.

24             THE COURT: I'm going to take a look at

25        that issue, but as a timesaver, if there's not 4913

1         an objection to it coming in, let's have it in.

2        I will take a closer look, and maybe over the

3        break we can explore that, whether the exhibit

4        has to be in evidence before he can testify

5        about it.

6             MR. KELLY: The '88 Surgeon General's

7        report is that big. There might be portions

8        that shouldn't come in. The particular part

9        we're talking about, I don't think anybody has

10        an objection to that part coming in.

11              THE COURT: I'm going to allow the

12        questions, understanding there's no objections

13        to at least this portion coming in, and take a

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=331
14        look at this here.

15             MR. SCAROLA: Our objection is that any

16        portion, it should be the entire document.

17             THE COURT: We'll take that up at the

18        break.

19             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

20        concluded and the following proceedings were

21         held within the presence of the jury:)

22     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

23        Q.   Ready?

24        A.   I'm ready.

25        Q.   Okay. So am I. 4914

1              Do you recall, Doctor, that the 1988

2   Surgeon General's report reported --

3             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. For

4        the record, the record should reflect that all

5        of the portions to which counsel is referencing

6        are being offered into evidence, they're being

7        admitted without objection, so I don't have any

8        problem with that, with the understanding that

9        we'll have an opportunity to offer any

10        additional segments we choose to at the

11         appropriate time.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: If I could have Defense

13        Exhibit AS34, please.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   This is a segment from the 1988 Surgeon

16   General's report that you were a reviewer for?

17        A.   Right.

18        Q.   The one that you discussed during the

19   course of your direct examination with Mr. Scarola,

20   right?

21         A.   Correct.

22        Q.   And let's just talk about it.

23             The whole yellow, please. Great. Thanks.

24             And it is reported there that as early as

25   the 1920s and '30s, some investigators were 4915

1    concluding that nicotine was responsible for the

2   compulsive use of tobacco products, and it cites a

3   number of publications, right?

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And then it goes on to report that

6   Johnston in 1942 concluded that smoking is

7   essentially a means of administering nicotine, just

8   as smoking opium is a means of administering

9   morphine.

10             First of all, do you see that?

11         A.   I do.

12        Q.   Secondly, 1942 was 30 years before

13   Dr. Claude Teague wrote in an internal document that

14   nicotine was the sine qua non of cigarette smoking,

15   right?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=332
16        A.   That's right. His document was 1972.

17        Q.   Hardly a new idea in 1972, would you

18   agree?

19        A.   I would agree that Dr. Teague's article

20   was authored in 1972.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I'm not sure

22        that we've given this exhibit a number.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: I actually read it out.

24        I'll read it again.

25             MR. SCAROLA: I apologize. 4916

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: AS, apple, Sam, 34.

2             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.

3             THE COURT: I'm sorry, AS --

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: AS34.

5             You can take that down as well. Thanks.

6     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

7        Q.   Isn't it true that over the years, smoking

8   behavior had been characterized a number of

9   different ways?

10        A.   Yes.

11         Q.   For example, you know, that the Diagnostic

12   and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric

13   Association refers to it as -- uses the term

14   "dependence" to discuss smoking and other drugs --

15        A.   Correct.

16        Q.   --right?

17             You yourself have used the terms

18    "addiction" and "dependence" interchangeably,

19   correct?

20        A.   That's correct.

21         Q.   And at times you have used the word

22   "habit" interchangeably with "addiction" and

23    "dependence"?

24        A.   Right. I think I said that yesterday.

25        Q.   You did. And you agree, and I think you 4917

1    said this yesterday as well, that no matter what

2   label you use, it's the behavior, not the label that

3   is important, right?

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And I think you said, "I don't care what

6   you call it," right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   And the behavior that you're talking

9   about, whether you call it a habit or an addiction

10   or a dependence, is that it can be difficult to quit

11    smoking, true?

12        A.   I think what I said was drug-reinforced.

13        Q.   Okay. And that it can be difficult to

14   quit?

15        A.   It surely is, yes.

16        Q.   Now, this 1964 Surgeon General's report

17   that you also discussed briefly during your direct

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=333
18   examination acknowledged, did it not, that smoking

19   can be difficult to quit?

20        A.   It did.

21         Q.   The Surgeon General's report in 1964 also

22   acknowledged that nicotine could have an affect in

23   the central nervous system including the brain,

24   didn't it?

25        A.   It did. 4918

1         Q.   The Surgeon General also recognized that

2   cigarette smoking -- that nicotine, rather, was an

3   important reason why people smoked cigarettes,

4   right?

5        A.   It did.

6        Q.   And didn't the Surgeon General's report in

7    1964 also observe that cigarettes that did not

8   contain nicotine had not found general public

9   acceptance?

10        A.   It did. In other words, people would be

11    able to stop smoking.

12        Q.   Isn't it true that over the years, based

13   upon your review of the various Surgeon General's

14   reports, the Surgeon General has referred to smoking

15   as a personal choice behavior?

16        A.   They have used that terminology.

17        Q.   Do you recall whether or not that that

18   terminology was used in the 1977, 1978 Surgeon

19   General's report?

20        A.   I don't know which reports it's been used

21    in, but I know in some of my testimony it's been

22   brought up that that terminology was used, and I've

23   heard it referenced before.

24        Q.   Do you know whether or not in 1986 the

25   Surgeon General referred to cigarette smoking as an 4919

1    addictive behavior that the individual must decide

2   whether to continue or not?

3        A.   No, the '86 report was on involuntary

4   smoking.

5        Q.   You don't remember that?

6        A.   I don't know. That was on the health

7   effects of secondhand smoke, so I'm not sure whether

8   they talked about it in that regard. They may have.

9        Q.   You want to -- may I show you to see if

10   you can recall it?

11         A.   Sure. There have been 30 reports. I

12   haven't memorized every word in the thousand pages

13   of each report.

14        Q.   Fair enough.

15             If I can have AS33, please.

16        A.   Thank you.

17        Q.   The last page of the exhibit is what I

18   wanted to have you take a look at, Doctor.

19        A.   Sure.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=334
20        Q.   And for the record, it's Roman numeral --

21    little Roman numeral XII. And I'm looking at the

22   first sentence of the last paragraph, the

23   introduction by Surgeon General Koop. You see it?

24        A.   I do.

25        Q.   Does that refresh your recollection as to 4920

1   whether or not in 1986 the Surgeon General describes

2   cigarette smoking as an addictive behavior that the

3   individual smoker must decide whether to continue --

4   to decide whether to continue?

5             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

6        Again, I have no objection to this document,

7        but before the contents of the document are

8        referenced, it should be admitted into

9        evidence.

10             THE COURT: Counsel, you want to approach?

11              (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

12        held out of the presence of the jury:)

13             THE COURT: My understanding of the law is

14        that as long as an expert witness has relied

15        upon it, and as long as it's the kind of

16        information reasonably relied upon by experts,

17        the evidence does not need to be admitted in

18        order for the witness to testify about it.

19             I am going to allow the witness to testify

20        about it. We can take up whether there's no

21         objection to portions being admitted, but I am

22        going to allow him to testify about it. I

23        don't think there's any dispute he relied upon

24        it, and it's the type of information reasonably

25        relied upon. 4921

1              MR. SCAROLA: I don't think that predicate

2        has been laid yet.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: The Surgeon General's

4        report, if I need to do it.

5             THE COURT: Which predicate, that he's

6        relied upon it?

7             MR. SCAROLA: That he's relied upon it.

8             THE COURT: Why don't you lay that

9        predicate. You need to bring counsel back.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Jack.

11              MR. HENK: Both yesterday as to

12        photographs, and today on two occasions now,

13        plaintiffs counsel has suggested that

14        documents be admitted into evidence during the

15        plaintiffs case in chief that the defendants

16        were not requested to be admitted in the

17        plaintiffs case in chief.

18             I know your Honor has admitted them, but

19        it was not for the record the defendants that

20        were seeking --

21              THE COURT: Has admitted what?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=335
22             MR. HENK: Those documents.

23             THE COURT: Which documents?

24             MR. HENK: The two paragraphs.

25             THE COURT: I haven't admitted anything 4922

1        right now. We're talking about whether counsel

2        can ask the witness about the Surgeon General's

3        report, and I said he can.

4             MR. HENK: I think you thought Mr. Scarola

5        said a document was admitted without objection.

6             THE COURT: Counsel at the previous

7        sidebar indicated that the portion he was

8        asking the witness about they didn't object to.

9        I don't think I made an official ruling, but

10        they both decided that they didn't object to

11         that portion.

12             But my ruling at that point, having

13        studied the law, is it need not be admitted as

14        long as a predicate is laid.

15             MR. HENK: I agree with you, he did not

16        move anything into evidence.

17             THE COURT: Okay.

18             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

19        concluded and the following proceedings were

20        held within the presence of the jury:)

21      BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

22        Q.   Ready?

23        A.   Ready.

24        Q.   Let me ask the question again because I

25   think -- I've lost the thread, and I'm sure others 4923

1   may have to.

2             Isn't it true that in 1986, the Surgeon

3   General's report, in the preface by Dr. Koop, the

4   then Surgeon General, said that cigarette smoking --

5             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, your Honor. He's

6        supposed to ask the reliance question first.

7             THE COURT: You may lay the predicate.

8     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

9        Q.   Doctor, you have reviewed the Surgeon

10   General's reports?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   You rely upon them routinely in your

13   testimony, do you not?

14        A.   I do.

15        Q.   You recognize them as authoritative?

16        A.   I do.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you very much.

18             THE COURT: You may proceed.

19     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

20        Q.   Isn't it true that in 1986, the Surgeon

21    General of the United States, then Surgeon General

22   Koop, right?

23        A.   C. Everett Koop, yes.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=336
24        Q.   Yes. Reported that cigarette smoking is

25   an addictive behavior, and the individual smoker 4924

1   must decide whether or not to continue that

2   behavior?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Thank you.

5             Now, as I think you discussed in your

6   direct testimony, in 1988, the Surgeon General for

7   the very first time decided that smoking should be

8   called an addiction.

9        A.   Well, apparently not, because he said it

10   was an addiction in 1986.

11         Q.   Yes. And as we discussed, the terms are

12   oftentimes used interchangeably, "addiction,"

13    "dependence," "habit," right?

14        A.   Well, the report in 1988 was unique

15   because it focused on smoking behavior. So it was

16   the first of the Surgeon General's reports to be

17   devoted to the behavioral effects of smoking, in

18   other words, why people smoke. All the other

19   reports up to that time had been on the health

20   consequences of smoking.

21         Q.   And so it's the first time, in 1988, that

22   the Surgeon General focused on smoking as a behavior

23   as a principal focus of the report?

24        A.   That's right.

25        Q.   And in 1988, as I think you discussed, the 4925

1    Surgeon General used a different definition of

2   addiction that would be the classic definition that

3   had been used in the 1964 report, when there was a

4   chapter devoted to the subject, right?

5        A.   Well, the classic definition you're

6   referring to, the American Psychiatric Association

7   in 1964 included intoxication, so a drug had to be

8   intoxicating in order to be addictive. That

9   definition went out of favor actually by the World

10   Health Organization a few years later.

11              And then in 1988 when they did the report

12   devoted to tobacco use, they included the experts

13   who put that report together, you know, reviewed the

14   history and looked at the prevailing evidence that

15   had accumulated at that time to look at, and

16   classified cigarette smoking as addictive. And they

17   talked about various criteria for defining nicotine

18   addiction, which was quite relevant to defining

19   treatments for smokers.

20        Q.   Doctor, my only question was in 1988, the

21    definition changed from the classic definition used

22   in 1964, yes or no?

23        A.   That would be a no. The definition didn't

24   change, it was just the first time they had devoted

25   a report to it.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=337
4926

1         Q.   Well, the Surgeon General in 1964 used the

2   definition of addiction. You're not disputing that,

3   are you?

4        A.   They did, they used the American

5   Psychiatric definition, which defined addictive

6   drugs as having to be intoxicated.

7        Q.   You don't dispute that in 1988, the

8   Surgeon General used a different definition?

9        A.   They did. They reviewed the history of

10   the various definitions that had been used, and they

11    used a different definition. But it wasn't like it

12   changed in 1988. Actually, the World Health

13   Organization changed the definition, I believe, in

14    1968.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: Move to strike the

16        response of the last portion of the answer,

17        your Honor.

18             THE COURT: I will grant that.

19             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry, I don't know what

20        the last portion means, your Honor. I'm not

21         sure what's been stricken at this point.

22             THE COURT: Counsel, why don't you just

23        state what portion you are seeking.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't have the

25        real-time, so I can't do it. I certainly can't 4927

1         do it from memory.

2             THE COURT: If you want to rephrase the

3        question or ask the question again so that the

4        witness can answer only that question which was

5        posed to the witness.

6     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

7        Q.   In 1988, the Surgeon General used a

8   different definition of addiction than had been used

9   in the 1964 report, wherever it may have come from,

10   it was different, right?

11         A.   It was different.

12        Q.   And one of the differences, I think you

13   pointed out, was that no longer was an addictive

14   drug required to be intoxicating, right?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   There were other differences as well,

17   true?

18        A.   That's correct.

19        Q.   Isn't it true that there were addiction

20   experts at the time who said that the definition

21    should not be changed in 1988?

22        A.   Well, there were people who in 1988 didn't

23   agree with the criteria that were articulated in the

24    1988 report. I don't think the definitions changed

25   in '88. They changed earlier. 4928

1        Q.   There were people who disagreed, who were

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=338
2   addiction experts, in 1988 with the definition that

3   was used in the 1988 Surgeon General's report, true?

4        A.   There were, yeah.

5        Q.   And those were experts who were not

6   associated with the tobacco industry, right?

7        A.   Yes. I mean, Surgeon General's reports

8   are built on evidence, so they represent the

9   prevailing scientific view, but not everybody

10   necessarily agrees with that. It's the prevailing

11    view, weight of evidence.

12        Q.   Now, you were shown a video clip during

13   the course of your direct examination yesterday of

14   the 1994 Congressional hearing where executives from

15   the tobacco companies were asked whether or not

16   nicotine was addictive. Do you remember that?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   Okay. And that included testimony from

19   Mr. Jim Johnston, who at that time was the chief

20   executive officer of my client, R.J. Reynolds

21    Tobacco Company, right?

22        A.   That's correct.

23        Q.   And you may recall that Mr. Johnston was

24   asked, "Do you believe that nicotine is addictive?"

25   And that his answer was, "Smoking and nicotine 4929

1    clearly do not meet the classic definition of

2   addiction," and then he started to go on and talk

3   about how nicotine is not intoxicating. Do you

4   remember that?

5        A.   That's correct.

6        Q.   Okay. And then Congressman Wyden

7   interrupted him and stopped him from answering

8   further. Do you remember that?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   When Mr. Johnston testified that smoking

11    and nicotine did not meet the classic definition of

12   addiction in part because nicotine was not

13   intoxicating, that was true, wasn't it?

14        A.   Nicotine is not intoxicating, true.

15        Q.   Mr. Johnston never testified that quitting

16   smoking was easy, did he?

17        A.   No, he said it was not addictive.

18        Q.   He never denied that quitting smoking

19   could be hard, did he?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   In fact, during the course of your direct

22   examination, did you show the ladies and gentlemen

23   of the jury a single statement from any tobacco

24   company employee or representative that denied that

25   smoking could be hard to quit? 4930

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   Thank you.

3        A.   Except -- I'll just correct that. Yes, I

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimo^pgNbr=339
4   did.

5        Q.   You did?

6        A.   I did.

7        Q.   Which one was that?

8        A.   There was a Tobacco Institute press

9   release that was May 16th, 1988, Brendan Moran and

10   Walker Merryman talking about the Surgeon General's

11    report, and said that all people had to do was make

12   up their mind to quit, and it was easy to do.

13   40 million Americans had done it, and characterizing

14   cigarette smoking as an addiction was a disservice

15   to the American public.

16        Q.   Okay. Well, that's in evidence, we can

17   look at it. But you would agree, would you not,

18   that just because someone is addicted doesn't mean

19   they cannot quit smoking?

20        A.   I would agree with that.

21         Q.   You would agree that addicted smokers can

22   and do quit smoking every day?

23        A.   Yes, they can. I help them to quit. I

24   run the Quitline.

25        Q.   And over one million Americans quit 4931

1    smoking every year, true?

2        A.   I don't know that number, per se, but I

3   don't dispute that.

4        Q.   You don't dispute that?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report,

7   isn't it true that somewhere in the neighborhood of

8   60 million people have quit smoking?

9        A.   Well, the definition of "quit" is

10   something I pay attention to because those are based

11    on cross-sectional studies, and you really have to

12   look at it longitudinally because many people report

13   that they're not smoking on a given day, and may be

14   smoking again because relapse is part of the

15   addictive process.

16             So I do know the government has put out

17   various statistics on how many former smokers there

18   are, and I think I gave the jury the definition. A

19   hundred cigarettes a day? Do you smoke every day,

20   some days, or not at all? If you're a hundred

21    cigarettes and you're not at all, then you're

22   classified as a former smoker.

23        Q.   Okay. Do you disagree that there are

24   60 million former smokers that has been reported by

25   the Surgeon General of the United States? 4932

1        A.   I don't disagree with that.

2        Q.   And that would be since 1964, correct?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Okay. Would you agree that at least by

5   your definition, tens of millions of addicted

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=340
6   smokers have quit smoking?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Isn't it true that during the time period

9   that Mr. Piendle was -- quit smoking, which I think

10   would have been 1989, right?

11         A.   That's right.

12        Q.   That at that time, approximately

13   90 percent of the millions of people that had quit

14   smoking did so cold turkey?

15        A.   Yes, based on the surveys at that time.

16        Q.   Okay. You mention in your direct

17   examination that you teach a smoking cessation

18   clinic, right?

19        A.   That's right.

20        Q.   And you teach the folks who attend that

21    smoking cessation class that anyone can quit

22   smoking, don't you?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   You have written in pamphlets and other

25   documents that you hand out to smokers that all 4933

1    smokers have the ability to quit, right?

2        A.   Well, they come for treatment. So, yeah,

3   I don't turn anybody away.

4        Q.   Well, a pamphlet that you wrote for the

5   American Cancer Society was entitled "Smart Move, a

6   Stop Smoking Guide." Do you remember that one?

7        A.   That's right.

8        Q.   Again, you can get it out if you want.

9   But the "Smart Move" pamphlet provides guidance to

10   people who want to quit smoking, doesn't it?

11         A.   Right. It talks about the health effects

12   of smoking, nicotine dependence, withdrawal, as well

13   as tips for trying to stay off of cigarettes.

14        Q.   Okay. And you believe at one time that

15   that pamphlet was the most widely disseminated

16   stop-smoking booklet ever, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   Now, why don't we actually get it out.

19   That would be AN 133.

20             May I approach, your Honor?

21              THE COURT: Yes.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

23        A.   Thank you.

24     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

25        Q.   And I wanted to direct your attention --1 4934

1    don't think our pages are numbered, but that would

2   be the fourth page in. The page that has, at the

3   top, "Do you have what it takes to stop smoking?"

4             If you could pull it up for them.

5             MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry. Has this been

6        admitted into evidence?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: No. It's something that

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=341
8        had been written. I'm entitled to ask him

9        about it.

10             MR. SCAROLA: I have no objection to it

11         going into evidence, your Honor --

12             THE COURT: The question was, is this

13        something that the witness has written?

14             THE WITNESS: It is.

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is.

16             THE COURT: Okay. Perhaps, just lay the

17        predicate that he -- regarding his reliance

18        on -- is this something that he has relied upon

19        in giving his opinion?

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Doctor, this is -

21              MR. SCAROLA: I'm not concerned about that

22        predicate, your Honor. It's just that if it's

23        going to be shown to the jury, it should be

24        marked as an exhibit and admitted into

25        evidence, and I have no objection to that. 4935

1              THE COURT: Okay. I'll have it marked.

2        If you're not seeking to have it admitted into

3        evidence at this time, I'm not going to admit

4        it into evidence at this time, but I will ask

5        you to mark it --

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: It is marked already,

7        your Honor, as AN, apple, Nancy, 133.

8             THE COURT: Okay.

9     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

10        Q.   Ready, Doctor?

11         A.   I'm ready.

12        Q.   Okay. Good. And you write in big letters

13   at the top of this page "Do you have what it takes

14   to quit smoking?" Right?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   And the first sentence under the heading

17   says "There is no magic cure that can help you stop.

18   Take this short quiz to find out if you have what it

19   takes," right?

20        A.   That's right.

21         Q.   And that's true, isn't it, there's no

22   magic cure?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And then let's take a look at the short

25   quiz to find out if you have what it takes, and it 4936

1    consists of three questions, right?

2        A.   Right.

3        Q.   And the first question is:  "Do you want

4   to stop smoking?" Correct?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   The second question is:  "Are you willing

7   to make some changes in your daily routine?" Right?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   And the third question is:  "Are you

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=342
10   willing to put up with some uneasy moments after

11    stopping?" Correct?

12        A.   Correct.

13        Q.   And if we go down just a little bit --

14   yes -- you say, "If you can answer yes to all three

15   questions, you can stop smoking," right?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   Okay. And isn't it true that you believe

18   that anybody can quit smoking if they set their mind

19   to it, if they want to do it, if they're willing to

20   change their daily routines, and they're willing to

21   put up with some uneasy moments after they quit?

22        A.   Well, they can make a quit attempt, but

23   most of the people who attempt to quit, end up

24   quitting for a brief period and relapsing back to

25   smoking, that's been my experience clinically 4937

1   working with thousands and thousands of smokers over

2   the years, but certainly we -- this is really just

3   to assess whether the person is ready to make the

4   quit attempt, and what I've found is that predictors

5   of making a quit attempt are very different than

6   those that predict who is able to sustain that

7   attempt and be off of cigarettes.

8        Q.   Doctor, you didn't tell the folks who

9   answered "yes" to the question, do you want to stop

10   smoking, to the question are you willing to make

11    some changes in your daily routine, and are you

12   willing to put up with some uneasy moments, that

13   they can make a quit attempt, you tell them, you can

14   stop smoking. Do you disagree with that?

15        A.   I said that, but I also then go on to talk

16   about nicotine dependence later on in the document.

17        Q.   Doctor, the answer is -- the question is:

18   Do you disagree that the pamphlet you wrote and what

19   you told smokers, do you disagree that if you can

20   answer "yes" to these three questions, you can stop

21    smoking?

22        A.   I wrote that and I gave the explanation of

23   what it means. It's basically trying to identify

24   people are ready to make a quit attempt, which is

25   the first step in the process of moving towards 4938

1   quitting smoking.

2        Q.   And you believe that they can stop

3   smoking?

4        A.   Yes, I work with people to help them quit.

5        Q.   You also agreed that a smoker is fully

6   responsible for making the decision to quit smoking,

7   didn't you?

8        A.   Yes, a person has to make the decision to

9   quit. Their ability to quit is another matter.

10        Q.   I was about to switch gears and talk a

11    little bit about Mr. Piendle, and why don't we start

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=343
12   there. Mr. Piendle was physically capable of

13   quitting smoking for good during any year that he

14   smoked from the 1950s all the way through 1988,

15   true?

16        A.   Well, sure. I mean, he was -- he had to

17   make up his mind to try to quit. He tried to quit

18   many times and then quit for good in 1989.

19        Q.   There was no period of time in which you

20   believe that Mr. Piendle was unable to quit smoking,

21    right?

22        A.   Unable, but he was constrained in his

23   choice is my opinion because as I stated yesterday,

24   he was addicted to nicotine.

25        Q.   He couldn't quit like that? 4939

1        A.   It was not easy for him to quit smoking,

2   that's right.

3        Q.   As I think you noted in 1989, he did quit

4   smoking, true?

5        A.   That's true.

6        Q.   He never relapsed, did he?

7        A.   After '89, that's true.

8        Q.   There's no evidence that he ever smoked a

9   cigarette again after 1989?

10        A.   Right, but he did relapse beforehand.

11         Q.   When Mr. Piendle quit smoking in 1989, he

12   did so without any assistance from anyone else; did

13   he not?

14        A.   I believe he chewed gum and toothpicks, as

15   I recall, but those were the aids that he used,

16   which are common, oral aids that people use for

17   trying to stay away from cigarettes.

18        Q.   Right. He didn't use any antismoking

19   medications, like nicotine gum, which would have

20   been available, I believe, at that time by

21   prescription, right?

22        A.   That was the only stop smoking medication

23   available at the time was the gum, and he did not

24   use the nicotine gum from my review of the records.

25        Q.   In fact, do you remember whether the patch 4940

1   became available in 1992; is that right?

2        A.   December of 1992.

3        Q.   Mr. Piendle didn't try hypnosis, right?

4        A.   No.

5        Q.   He didn't go to a smoking cessation

6   clinic, did he?

7        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

8        Q.   In 1989, he did not ask a doctor, at least

9   based upon your review of the records, for any

10   assistance in quitting smoking, did he?

11         A.   No.

12        Q.   Do you know if he ever asked a doctor for

13   assistance in quitting smoking, based upon the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=344
14   records that you reviewed?

15        A.   Based upon the records I reviewed, no, I

16   don't know that.

17        Q.   He had not yet been diagnosed with his

18   lung cancer in 1989, that occurred six years later,

19   right?

20        A.   '95.

21         Q.   And he hadn't yet been diagnosed with any

22   disease that is a smoking-related disease when he

23   quit in 1989, true?

24        A.   I don't believe that he had been formally

25   diagnosed, no. 4941

1         Q.   He didn't tell his wife that he was

2   planning to quit, did he?

3        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

4        Q.   You didn't tell her that he had quit

5   initially, right?

6        A.   I recall that, yes.

7        Q.   He didn't ask Mrs. Piendle to quit with

8   him, right?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   Okay. And Mrs. Piendle noticed that he

11    had quit a couple of days later when she saw he

12   wasn't smoking anymore, right?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   Now, pharmacology is the branch of science

15   that studies the effects of drugs on the human body,

16   right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   And when you talked to this jury about how

19   nicotine affects the brain, you are not speaking as

20   an expert in pharmacology, are you?

21         A.   No, I'm not a pharmacologist, I'm an

22   expert in human smoking behavior.

23        Q.   Would you defer to Dr. Benowitz on issues

24   like the effect of nicotine on the brain?

25        A.   I consider Dr. Benowitz an expert in the 4942

1    area of nicotine addiction, certainly.

2        Q.   Okay. So would you defer to him on issues

3   that are outside of your expertise?

4        A.   I don't know what issues I'm deferring to

5   him.

6        Q.   The effects of nicotine on the brain.

7        A.   I would certainly rely on Dr. Benowitz's

8   expertise in that area.

9        Q.   You think he has superior expertise to

10   your own in that area, sir?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   Thank you.

13             Psychiatrists, in their practice,

14   typically diagnose dependence and addiction, right?

15        A.   Well, doctors diagnose nicotine and

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=345
16   dependence, and psychiatry is one branch of

17   medicine, and mostly it's family doctors who do the

18   diagnosing, though.

19        Q.   Let me just ask you, you're not a

20   psychiatrist, correct?

21         A.   No.

22        Q.   You're not a clinical psychologist, are

23   you?

24        A.   No, I'm not.

25        Q.   If a smoker comes to your smoking 4943

1    cessation class and asks for a prescription drug to

2   help him or her quit smoking like, say, Chantix,

3   right, you can't prescribe it, can you?

4        A.   No, I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't

5   prescribe medications.

6        Q.   And when you tell the ladies and gentlemen

7   of this jury that a smoker, Mr. Piendle, was

8   addicted, you can't call that a diagnosis, can you?

9        A.   No. It's an assessment, and I have a lot

10   of experience in doing assessments of smoking

11   behavior.

12        Q.   And that's because medical doctors make

13   diagnoses, right?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   And you're not a medical doctor, right?

16        A.   That's correct.

17        Q.   And you know, from your review of

18   plaintiffs responses to interrogatories in this

19   case -- which was part of the materials you

20   reviewed, right?

21         A.   That's correct.

22        Q.    that the plaintiff takes the position

23   that addiction is a medical diagnosis, correct?

24        A.   I've seen that, yes.

25        Q.   You've mentioned you're not a medical 4944

1    doctor and you don't have a license to practice

2   medicine anywhere, do you?

3        A.   No. Not being a medical doctor, I don't

4   have a license to practice medicine.

5        Q.   And like Mrs. Piendle, you are not a

6   doctor who is qualified to give a medical diagnosis

7   of addiction, true?

8        A.   Well, I don't give a diagnosis, I do an

9   assessment, and I've assessed tens of thousands of

10   smokers and actually do teaching of doctors that are

11    in medical school or dental school, school of

12   pharmacy, school of nursing, to educate other health

13   professionals how to do a diagnosis.

14        Q.   Is that a "yes," Doctor?

15        A.   That's an explanation of what I do.

16        Q.   Is the answer "yes," that you are not

17   qualified to give a medical diagnosis that

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=346
18   Mr. Piendle was addicted?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. The

20        witness is not obliged to answer yes or no if

21         such a response is not complete and might be

22        misleading to the jury.

23             THE COURT: Well, if the witness needs to

24        explain his answer, certainly he may. 25

4945

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   Isn't it true that you are not qualified

3   to give a medical diagnosis of addiction?

4        A.   I am not qualified to give any medical

5   diagnosis because I am not a doctor of medicine.

6        Q.   And we know that none of Mr. Piendle's

7   medical doctors ever treated him for any addiction

8   to cigarettes, true?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   And is it not also true that none of his

11    medical doctors ever diagnosed him as addicted to or

12   dependent upon cigarettes or nicotine?

13        A.   They didn't use that language. They

14   certainly described his smoking status as a heavy

15   smoker. Most doctors don't use that terminology in

16   the medical records, has been my experience in

17   reviewing medical records, thousands of them.

18        Q.   Dr. Cummings, you did testify on direct

19   regarding your nonmedical assessment that

20   Mr. Piendle was addicted, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   And I'd like to talk about that a little

23   bit.

24             THE COURT: Okay. Would this be a

25        convenient breaking point? 4946

1              MR. BIERSTEKER: This would be a

2        convenient time.

3             THE COURT: We'll take our midmorning

4        break right now, and I would ask everyone to be

5        back just a little bit before 11:30, so a

6         15-minute break. Remember the important

7        instruction not to discuss the case, not to

8        talk with anyone associated with the case,

9        avoid any media, do not do any research.

10             Remind the witness you're under oath, do

11         not discuss your testimony with anyone, and

12        we'll see you back a little bit before 11:30.

13        Thank you.

14             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

15        after which the following proceedings were

16        held:)

17             THE COURT: The issue regarding the

18        admissibility of the documents that were shown

19        by defense to which plaintiffs expert has

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=347
20        relied upon. My understanding of 704 is that,

21         reading from part of it, if the facts or data

22        are the type reasonably relied upon by experts

23        on subjects for the opinion expressed, the

24        facts or data --

25             THE COURT REPORTER: I'm sorry, your 4947

1        Honor.

2             THE COURT: -- if the facts or data are of

3        the type reasonably relied upon by experts on

4        the subject to support the opinion expressed,

5        the facts or data need not be admissible in

6        evidence.

7             So I just want to clarify what everyone's

8        position is on this. Does defense take the

9        position you need not admit them into evidence?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think I've been given

11         free reign to cross-examine this witness. In

12        fact, I think that that specific reference

13        under the rules is only limited to those

14        instances when you're trying to impeach the

15        witness' testimony.

16             In this case, I'm not even trying to do

17        that. Look, the man has a significant command,

18        he's relied upon a lot of stuff. I think I'm

19        entitled to ask him. If he doesn't remember,

20        I'm entitled to show it to him, and I'm

21         entitled to elicit that information and even to

22        show it in front of the jury as part of my

23        cross-examination, whether or not he has relied

24        upon it and it was authoritative. But almost

25        all the materials would fall under that 4948

1        umbrella anyway.

2             THE COURT: Anything from the defense

3        before I hear from the plaintiff?

4             MR. KELLY: Yes, your Honor.

5             Unlike some types of technical information

6        that might be used to impeach an opinion

7        because it's different or contrary to the

8        opinion, most of this technical material is

9        being offered as a fact of historical

10        significance in the historical development of

11         the information available to the scientific

12        community, medical community, public health

13        community, and public at large with respect to

14        smoking and health, the topic this witness

15        talked about. So it's a fact which is relevant

16        and that's a little different than 704 talks

17        about -- if I got the number right there,

18        your Honor--

19             MR. BIERSTEKER: You did.

20             MR. KELLY: -- with respect to using

21         technical material to impeach a witness. So

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=348
22        much of this is a fact which is being

23        established as opposed to impeachment of an

24        opinion by a contrary opinion by an

25        authoritative source. 4949

1              THE COURT: Actually, 704 doesn't speak to

2        impeachment. This is actually just the basis

3        of an expert opinion, 704.

4             MR. HENK: May I just add one thing more,

5        your Honor, because it didn't end up on the

6        record when we spoke at the bench, which is at

7        no point during the plaintiffs case in chief

8        have defendants moved into evidence any

9        document.

10             The plaintiffs, I believe, on three

11         occasions have asked for documents to be

12        admitted during their own case in chief, during

13        our cross-examination, so I just wanted that

14        clear for the record.

15             THE COURT: Okay. Plaintiff.

16             MR. SCAROLA: I will start just briefly

17        responding to Mr. Henk. Mr. Henk was not at

18        the bench conference, so he was probably not

19        aware of the fact that there was a stipulation

20        with regard to a document to be admitted into

21         evidence, and the same is true with regard to

22        the photographs. I don't think I need to

23        respond to that further.

24             THE COURT: Right. Just so there's

25        clarification on -- let's see. All I have 4950

1        is -- there is one document and that was AS34,

2        which was one of the Surgeon General's report,

3        and there was an agreement that only the

4        portions testified to by the witness would be

5        admissible. Plaintiff indicated that plaintiff

6        wanted all -- the entire document in evidence,

7        but I have not ruled that the entire document

8        is in evidence.

9             MR. SCAROLA: That's correct.

10             THE COURT: And I didn't make any other

11         rulings, including on AS33 or 133, because of

12        the position that I am suggesting for

13        discussion at this point. So I'm going to let

14        the plaintiff respond now.

15             MR. SCAROLA: Yes.

16             Your Honor, it is our position that you

17        don't get to introduce the contents of a

18        document unless the document is admitted into

19        evidence. You can't put it up on the screen

20        and show it to the jury unless the document is

21         first admitted into evidence, at least the --

22        whatever you're going to show the jury needs to

23        first be admitted.

24             Now, the fact that the witness has relied

25        upon it provides a predicate for the admission 4951

1         of that document. The fact that it may be a

2        prior inconsistent statement may provide a

3        basis for the introduction of the document.

4        Obviously, if it's the witness' own statement,

5        you can read it to him, just as you would a

6        deposition. You get the answer from him first

7        and you say, isn't it a fact that you wrote

8        something inconsistent with this. On page 4 of

9        this document, didn't you say the following?

10             Now, that's fine. But just like you don't

11         get to put the deposition on the screen to get

12        that portion that is inconsistent before the

13        jury, you don't get to put the pamphlet on the

14        screen unless you introduce it.

15             I don't have an objection to its

16        introduction, but I don't believe we should be

17        showing documents to the jury unless and until

18        the document is admitted in evidence. I don't

19        contest its admissibility. My concern is with

20        the procedure, and the procedure should be mark

21         it for identification, show it to opposing

22        counsel, offer it into evidence before it goes

23        up on the screen. That's my concern.

24             THE COURT: Okay. What I would ask is if

25        plaintiff has any cases to support their 4952

1        position. My understanding of 704, having

2        looked at a number of cases during the

3        testimony, is that these documents need not be

4        admitted. So I'm going to reserve at this

5        point.

6             I am going to ask if you have a case that

7        suggests otherwise, bring it to the Court's

8        attention, but at this point, I am going to

9        allow the testimony to continue in the fashion

10        it has, and with the exception of the agreement

11         as to that one section of the Surgeon

12        General's, I am not admitting any of the other

13        documents, but invite plaintiffs counsel to

14        provide the Court with the authority for

15        position it has taken.

16             MR. SALES: I did want to add one thing.

17        As your Honor knows, there's thousands of these

18        documents. Experience has taught in this

19        courtroom for both sides that sometimes a part

20        of a document used with one witness helps one

21         side and another part of a document with the

22        same witness would help the other.

23             And what counsel has done in the crossing

24        of these witnesses is during the examination,

25        and we're trying to help one another, given us

4953

1         only the page or a portion of the document that

2        they're interested in.

3             THE COURT: Let me interrupt for a moment.

4        I think plaintiffs counsel has agreed -- this

5        much, I don't believe is in dispute -- that if

6        a portion of a document is referenced, even if

7        it's not put into evidence, that you'll provide

8        plaintiffs counsel with the entire document,

9        correct? Mr. Biersteker, you agree with that?

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: They're on our exhibit

11         list and I have no objection. I was trying to

12        conserve on the amount of paper we had to

13        wrestle with in the courtroom.

14             THE COURT: I understand, but plaintiffs

15        counsel should be entitled at least to have the

16        entirety of the document that you're utilizing.

17             MR. SALES: The economy of this courtroom

18        doesn't permit, and the number of thousands of

19        pages don't permit every single thing exchanged

20        by the parties to be in the courtroom.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: That's the problem.

22             MR. SALES: It's reasonable to require,

23        when impeaching a witness, that the whole

24        document be given to the opponent so that the

25        opponent can be looking at it before he has to 4954

1         give up --

2             THE COURT: Well, AS34, 33, and 133,

3        defense counsel, is it possible, over this

4        break, to give those three documents to

5        plaintiffs?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: They have got the full

7        document on pamphlet. That was the last one

8        used.

9             MR. SALES: That one is full.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: Two Surgeon General's

11         reports, we will get them for them. I don't

12        know if it's possible to do it in whatever time

13        remains on this break.

14             THE COURT: Your cocounsel, Ms. Kessler,

15        says yes.

16             Are you anticipating any other documents?

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Yes, and I will provide

18        them full copies to the best of my ability, but

19        none of this is any surprise.

20             THE COURT: So we'll be in brief recess

21         for a few more minutes.

22             MR. HENK: May I tender a bench brief on

23        the issue of using counsel's submissions during

24        voir dire --

25             THE COURT: Yes. 4955

1            MR. HENK: -- and note for the record

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=351
2        plaintiffs have not stated what their objection

3        is to their use.

4             THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. We'll be in

5        recess for a few minutes.

6             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

7         11:22 a.m. until 11:36 a.m., after which the

8        following proceedings were held:)

9             THE COURT: Are you anticipating you may

10        finish before the lunch hour?

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Not a chance.

12             THE COURT: No uncertainty about that.

13        What if I made lunch at 2:00 o'clock?

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: If you starve me, maybe,

15        or I fall from exhaustion. But no, not a

16        chance. It's taken longer than I had

17        anticipated it would.

18             THE BAILIFF: Jury entering.

19             (Thereupon, the jury entered the

20        courtroom, after which the following

21        proceedings were held:)

22             THE COURT: Okay. Welcome back. You may

23        be seated, and counsel may proceed.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I proceed,

25        your Honor? 4956

1              THE COURT: Yes, you may.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you.

3     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

4        Q.   Okay. We were about ready to talk about

5   Mr. Piendle a little bit and your nonmedical

6   assessment that he was addicted. And if I

7   understood your testimony on direct examination,

8   what you look at to determine whether or not a

9   smoker is addicted are two things. First, whether

10   they have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their

11    lifetime, and second, whether they are smoking

12   daily. Did I get that right?

13        A.   Those are part of it. There are obviously

14   additional things that I testified to that I do as

15   part of the assessment.

16        Q.   Yes, you did talk about other things, but

17   I thought that those were in reference to the

18   severity of the dependence as opposed to whether or

19   not somebody was addicted.

20        A.   That's right.

21         Q.   So on the threshold issue of whether

22   somebody is addicted or not, your assessment is they

23   are addicted if they smoke more than 100 cigarettes

24   in a lifetime and they are smoking daily?

25        A.   Yes, regular daily smoker. 4957

1         Q.   Regular daily smoker. And that's not a

2   definition of addiction that is found in any medical

3   textbook or treatise, is it?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=352
4        A.   No. It's what we use in New York State to

5   basically screen people for treatments so we can

6   match the treatments to a smoker.

7        Q.   That's what you use on the Quitline,

8   right?

9        A.   Quitline, and also utilized in some of our

10   studies where we tracked thousands and thousands of

11    smokers to look at predictors of quitting.

12        Q.   It is on that basis that you assessed

13   Mr. Piendle to be addicted in high school, right?

14        A.   Well, it's --1 look at, as I said, daily

15   use versus nondaily use. Most cigarette smokers are

16   daily users, and then I look at the severity of

17   nicotine dependence or addiction, however you want

18   to label it, which is based on a variety of criteria

19   that I described, such as the amount that somebody

20   smokes per day, the time to first cigarette in the

21    morning. That's an index called the Heaviness of

22   Smoking Index that I utilize because it's validated

23   as a predictor of struggles in quilting smoking, and

24   it's a very quick screen, useful for treatment

25   matching, and it is utilized in a number of the 4958

1    clinical trials that I have going on. So we don't

2   bring people in for clinical trials like our

3   nicotine vaccine trial if they're nondaily smokers.

4        Q.   Again, just to separate the two issues,

5   the first issue in your mind is whether somebody is

6   addicted, and that's 100 cigarettes plus smoking

7   daily, right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And then there's the second issue, which

10   we'll get to in a moment, about the severity of

11    addiction, fair enough?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   It is on the basis of the first part, the

14    100 cigarettes plus smoking daily, that you decided

15   or assessed Mr. Piendle to be addicted in 19 --1

16   think you said '55 or '57, right?

17        A.   I believe he started smoking somewhere

18   between the ages of 13 and 15.

19        Q.   13 and 15. Now, you reviewed depositions,

20   you told us that, right?

21         A.   That's correct.

22        Q.   And you know that Mr. Cabral testified

23   that at least in high school, Mr. Piendle was

24   smoking once in a while, right?

25        A.   I think every day before and after school 4959

1   is what I recall.

2        Q.   Do you remember Ms. Worobel testifying

3   that he smoked socially?

4        A.   I recall her primarily talking about the

5   brands of cigarettes she recalled him smoking.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=353
6        Q.   It doesn't surprise you, does it, that an

7   athlete like Mr. Piendle in high school would smoke

8   once in a while or socially?

9        A.   It doesn't surprise me, back at the time

10   that Mr. Piendle was in high school, that he was

11    smoking. I believe it was characterized every day

12   after school or before school, as I recall from one

13   of his friends.

14        Q.   One of his friends?

15        A.   Mr. Cabral, I believe.

16        Q.   Do you know -- there's no record of when

17   Mr. Piendle smoked his first cigarette in the

18   morning when he was in high school, is there?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   And, in fact, I think you probably saw

21    this in the deposition, but Mr. Piendle's mother at

22   least spoke to his brother, Mr. Edward Piendle,

23   about not smoking, right? Do you remember reading

24   that?

25        A.   I don't recall that specifically, but I 4960

1    don't dispute that that might have been mentioned in

2   one of the thousands of pages of deposition records

3   that I reviewed.

4        Q.   Would you expect Mrs. Piendle --

5   Mr. Piendle's mom might be a better way to say it.

6        A.   Right.

7        Q.   Would you expect Mr. Piendle's mom back

8   when he was in high school to let him get away with

9   smoking his first cigarette in the morning over

10   breakfast in the home?

11         A.   No. Generally my experience is that

12   junior high students are not going downstairs to

13   smoke a cigarette with their breakfast in the

14   morning.

15        Q.   In connection with assessing severity of

16   addiction, you talked about withdrawal symptoms,

17   right?

18        A.   That's right.

19        Q.   Okay. And addicted smokers, I think you

20   said when they quit, typically experience withdrawal

21    symptoms, right?

22        A.   That's right.

23        Q.   Okay. And people who are more heavily

24   addicted, I believe you said on direct examination,

25   experience more withdrawal symptoms than people who 4961

1    are not as severely addicted, right?

2        A.   It's -- the reports of withdrawal, we have

3   to have that they are more likely to be reported by

4   people who are heavier smokers, more frequent per

5   day smokers.

6        Q.   All right. So people who smoke more

7   cigarettes a day are more likely to report more

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=354
8   significant withdrawal symptoms than people who

9   smoke fewer cigarettes per day?

10        A.   Frequency of withdrawal.

11         Q.   Frequency of withdrawal?

12        A.   Right.

13        Q.   Isn't it true that withdrawal symptoms

14   usually peak within a few days after quitting, and

15   then decline thereafter?

16        A.   It's been my experience.

17        Q.   And that withdrawal symptoms typically

18   include things like insomnia, right?

19        A.   That's right.

20        Q.   Headaches, isn't that one of them?

21         A.   I have a whole list of them here in the

22   "Smart Move" book. Irritability, tired, trouble

23   sleeping, hunger --

24        Q.   Let's take them one at time. Would you

25   agree that insomnia is one of the symptoms of 4962

1   withdrawal?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Would you agree that headaches are one of

4   the symptoms of withdrawal?

5        A.   Some people report having headaches, yes.

6        Q.   Would you agree that an inability to

7   concentrate is one of the symptoms of withdrawal?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   Would you agree that irritability is one

10   of the symptoms of withdrawal?

11         A.   Yeah, moody, irritability is fairly

12   common.

13        Q.   And I think your "Smart Move" booklet also

14   lists sore throat as one of the symptoms of

15   withdrawal, right?

16        A.   Actually, a dry throat. Because mucous

17   secretion turns off because smoke stimulates mucous

18   secretion, which is one of the reasons people have

19   smoker's cough.

20        Q.   And there are other withdrawal symptoms as

21    well?

22        A.   Yes, there are.

23        Q.   Now, there's no evidence that Mr. Piendle

24   in 1989, when he quit smoking, suffered from

25   insomnia, is there? 4963

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   There is no evidence that he had headaches

3   when he quit smoking in 1989, is there?

4        A.   Not in'89, no.

5        Q.   There's no evidence that he said he had an

6   inability to concentrate when he quit smoking in

7    1989, correct?

8        A.   That's correct.

9        Q.   There's no evidence that he had a sore or

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=355
10   dry throat when he quit smoking in 1989?

11         A.   True.

12        Q.   Isn't it true that Mrs. Piendle in the

13   deposition materials you read said that he was kind

14   of moody when he quit, I think was the quote?

15        A.   She did say that.

16        Q.   Do you remember that she based her

17   observation -- she based her conclusion that

18   Mr. Piendle was kind of moody on the fact that

19   Mr. Piendle didn't talk to her as much when he quit

20   as he had done beforehand? Do you remember that?

21         A.   She did state that he got moody when he

22   quit smoking.

23        Q.   And she did say that because Mr. Piendle

24   wasn't talking to her as much. Do you remember

25   that? 4964

1        A.   Not specifically that statement, I don't

2   recall that. I don't dispute it, but I don't recall

3   that one.

4        Q.   You don't dispute it?

5        A.   Right.

6        Q.   Let me just ask, assuming that the basis

7   for the conclusion that Mr. Piendle was kind of

8   moody was that he wasn't talking to Mrs. Piendle as

9   much as he had before he quit. Are you with me?

10        A.   Sure.

11         Q.   Isn't it true that based upon your review

12   of all the evidentiary record, there are alternative

13   explanations for why Mr. Piendle might have talked

14   less to Mrs. Piendle when he quit smoking?

15        A.   Such as?

16        Q.   Let me give you an example. First, isn't

17   it true that when Mrs. Piendle discovered that

18   Mr. Piendle had quit smoking without her, she was a

19   little upset with him?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   And doesn't our common sense teach us that

22   couples who are a little bit upset with each other

23   might not talk to each other as much?

24        A.   Some people don't talk with each other,

25   and some people talk too much. 4965

1         Q.   So one of the ways that upset might

2   express itself in a relationship is people might not

3   talk to each other as much until they get over it,

4   right?

5        A.   Sure.

6        Q.   Second, you, I think, teach in your

7   smoking cessation classes that smokers who are

8   trying to quit should avoid triggers for smoking,

9   right?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   And you would agree with me that a trigger

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=356
12   would be being around other people who are smoking?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   In fact, that's probably one of the more

15   powerful triggers out there, right?

16        A.   So we advise people to avoid the triggers

17   as a coping mechanism.

18        Q.   And you specifically advise people who are

19   trying to quit to avoid being around people who are

20   smoking, right?

21         A.   Well, we actually advise them to throw out

22   their cigarettes, that's the most important thing,

23   and sometimes you can't avoid being around other

24   people who smoke.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that you advise them to 4966

1    avoid triggers, including being around other people

2   who are smoking?

3        A.   We advise them to stay away from triggers,

4   including other people who might be smokers, if they

5   can do it. It often comes up that there are other

6   family members who smoke, so it's not always

7   feasible.

8        Q.   Not always feasible. In fact, don't you

9   recommend that people who are trying to quit smoking

10   put "no smoking" signs in their cars or in their

11    work areas or in their homes?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   And as you know from reviewing the

14   evidentiary -- the depositions, rather, in this

15   case, Mrs. Piendle continued to smoke in 1989 when

16   Mr. Piendle quit, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   And do you remember Mrs. Piendle saying in

19   her deposition that Mr. Piendle would get up and

20   leave the room sometimes when she would light up a

21    cigarette in front of him, particularly after he

22   first quit?

23        A.   Yes.

24        Q.   Do you remember Mrs. Piendle testifying in

25   her deposition that Mr. Piendle just didn't want to 4967

1   be around her because she was smoking?

2        A.   I believe that's true.

3        Q.   Is it possible that Mr. Piendle was

4   speaking less to Mrs. Piendle after he quit smoking

5   because he was trying to avoid being around her

6   because she was smoking?

7        A.   I don't --1 have no knowledge of why he

8   would not be wanting to be around her, but -- so I

9   don't know.

10        Q.   Don't know. Okay. Not even possible in

11    your view?

12        A.   It's possible.

13        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=357
14             Now, you talked in your direct examination

15   about prior quit attempts. Do you remember that?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   So let's talk about those. Isn't it true

18   that there is no evidence that Mr. Piendle tried to

19   quit smoking in the 1950s?

20        A.   It's true.

21         Q.   And likewise, there's no evidence that he

22   tried to quit smoking in the 1960s, right?

23        A.   There's no record of it, that's true.

24        Q.   No record. And you mentioned some events

25   in the 1970s and '80s, remember? 4968

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   And there were New Year's resolutions, as

3   I recall.

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And those New Year's resolutions were

6   attempts to quit that were related to health

7   concerns in part?

8        A.   In part.

9        Q.   But isn't it true that based upon your

10   review of the depositions in this case, those

11    various quit attempts weren't all that memorable to

12   Mrs. Piendle?

13        A.   No, I think they were reported that they

14   quit -- made New Year's resolutions to quit, which

15   is a very common time that a lot of people try to

16   change their smoking behavior, and it typically

17   lasted a short duration. And that's what I recall.

18        Q.   Okay. Well, you have notes that you've

19   kept of the deposition materials that you reviewed,

20   right?

21         A.   I have them right here.

22        Q.   And, in fact, during your deposition you

23   would sometimes refer to them, right?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   Do you recall jotting down notes, based on 4969

1   your review of Mrs. Piendle's deposition testimony,

2   that the best she could do was to recall at least

3   one New Year's resolution to quit smoking that she

4   and Mr. Piendle made during the 12-year period from

5    1968 to 1980?

6        A.   What my notes say is prior to 1989, he

7   made many unsuccessful attempts to stop smoking, and

8   I reference various pages of Mrs. Piendle's

9   transcript, and then additional pages of Tracy

10   Piendle's transcript.

11              Then I go on to say, most quit attempts

12   were of brief duration, although his daughter said

13   he was able to quit for a couple of weeks one time.

14   And then I gave the page numbers there.

15        Q.   It wasn't clear, based upon your review,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=358
16   was it, what years the Piendles attempted to quit

17   smoking around New Year's Eve, was it?

18        A.   No, I don't think they had -- it wasn't

19   clear, as it rarely is when you ask people to recall

20   back decades, the specific dates of quit attempts.

21    They just recall that there are multiple quit

22   attempts, which is fairly common.

23        Q.   Now, there's a notion in your profession

24   that a quit attempt is something that lasts for 24

25   hours or more, right? 4970

1        A.   Well, a quit attempt is when somebody

2   tries to quit smoking. And, you know, typically you

3   can look at duration of quitting of 24 hours if you

4   want to try to characterize withdrawal symptoms. So

5   typically that's what the 24-hour criteria is used

6   to do.

7        Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that the Centers for

8   Disease Control defines a quit attempt as somebody

9   not smoking for 24 hours?

10        A.   The Centers for Disease Control defines

11    quitting, have you ever made a quit attempt, and

12   then they say, have you ever made a quit attempt for

13   24 hours or longer, a day or longer?

14             We actually assess days as well. So I'm

15   quite familiar with their surveys because I advise

16   them about the questions that they put in their

17   surveys.

18        Q.   Good. So one of the ways the Centers for

19   Disease Control characterizes a quit attempt is

20   whether somebody has abstained and not used

21    cigarettes for 24 hours, correct?

22        A.   That's one of the ways, yes.

23        Q.   Isn't it true that the Surgeon General in

24   the 1988 report that you reviewed used a 24 period

25   of continuous abstinence from tobacco to define 4971

1   initial cessation. Do you remember that?

2        A.   Some people have done that, yes. I recall

3   studies that have done that and have been cited in

4   Surgeon General's reports.

5        Q.   Okay. Now, isn't it true that some of the

6   recommendations that you make in your "Smart Move"

7   pamphlet was that folks need to commit themselves to

8   quitting?

9        A.   Sure.

10        Q.   And one of the things you sort of

11    recommend that smokers do is to actually fill out a

12   stop-smoking contract and have a family member or

13   friend sign the contract with them.

14        A.   It's in the guide. We use, in my clinic,

15   a contract. We actually ask people to put in ten

16   dollars, which we give them back a month later if

17   they are not smoking. The guide was actually

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=359
18   developed based on my clinic, but it is in the

19   booklet.

20        Q.   Okay.

21         A.   And-

22        Q.   I'm sorry, were you finished?

23        A.   Well, it's a self-help guide. So,

24   obviously, you can't do it like we do it,

25   face-to-face, at our clinics. 4972

1         Q.   And there's no evidence that the Piendles

2   ever made any such contract when they engaged in

3   these various New Year's resolutions, however many

4   there were, right?

5        A.   My experience is rarely outside the

6   confines of my clinic do people ever do the

7   contract. But we do it in the clinic to sort of

8   build up to the quit date. We prepare people for

9   quitting, and then on the date that they quit, we

10   have them sign the contract. We put in ten dollars,

11    they get the ten dollars back a month later. It

12   gives us an excuse to call them back.

13             And because many people come with family

14   members to quit smoking or friends, we actually pool

15   the money. We make a little joke that you can make

16   money by quitting smoking, because the people who go

17   back to smoking forfeit the ten dollars, and then we

18   divide up the remains among those who quit and stay

19   off. So we get the Rocky fight song out, and they

20   throw their cigarettes in the garbage.

21    Unfortunately, most of the people end up back

22   smoking again.

23        Q.   Let me just ask you a few questions.

24   Isn't it true that as part of the smoking cessation

25   class, you encourage people to throw away their 4973

1    ashtrays and their lighters?

2        A.   Yes. Most importantly their cigarettes.

3        Q.   We'll get to that in a moment.

4             Mr. Piendle did not throw out his lighter

5   when he made these various New Year's resolutions,

6   did he?

7        A.   Not that I recall.

8        Q.   Nor the ashtrays, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And you -- another thing you suggest that

11    smokers do is to tell family members and friends

12   that they either have or are going to stop smoking,

13   right?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And Mr. and Mrs. Piendle didn't do that in

16   connection with any of these New Year's resolutions,

17   as far as you could tell from the depositions you've

18   read, true?

19        A.   That's not true. No, they told each other

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=360
20   they were quitting.

21         Q.   They would tell each other. Fine.

22        A.   That would be the most important thing.

23        Q.   They didn't tell others beyond themselves?

24        A.   I don't know whether they did or not. I

25   don't know if that question was asked. 4974

1         Q.   Do you recall reading that they didn't

2   tell anybody because they didn't want to be

3   embarrassed if they failed? Do you remember reading

4   that?

5        A.   I don't, but that's a common reason that

6   some people, in my experience, are afraid to tell

7   other people that they're trying to quit, because

8   they've had the experience before trying to quit and

9   failed, and don't want to get people's expectations

10   up and be viewed as a failure.

11         Q.   Is it fair to say that the Piendles, in

12   making these various New Year's resolutions,

13   assuming that they did not tell other friends and

14   family members that they were doing it, and did not

15   throw away their ashtrays and did not throw away

16   their lighters, if all that is true, is it fair to

17   say that they were hedging their bets?

18        A.   No, I don't think those are uncommon.

19   People keep their lighters around, sometimes they're

20   gifts, there are other uses of lighters, and if

21    there are other smokers in the home, you're usually

22   not throwing the ashtrays out.

23             When my mom quit smoking, she saved the

24   ashtrays, they became candy dishes. So people are

25   not throwing out stuff. Although we advise people 4975

1   to get rid of all the reminders, but it's just

2   advice and people have to figure it out on their

3   own.

4        Q.   And you advise them to do that as symbols

5   of their commitment to quit?

6        A.   Most important symbol is making a quit

7   attempt.

8        Q.   Doctor, if you can answer the question,

9   please. You advise them to throw away their

10   cigarettes, their ashtrays, their lighters, and to

11    tell people and to make the contract in order to

12   ensure that they are committed to quitting?

13        A.   Those are all suggestions in the "Smart

14   Move" guide, yes.

15        Q.   And they are suggestions -- you may answer

16   the question, please -- in order to make sure that

17   the smoker is as committed as possible to quitting,

18   as symbols of that commitment, aren't they?

19        A.   No. They're trying to remove the common

20   triggers and cues that are around that remind people

21    about their smoking because we know that those

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=361
22   symbols and cues become triggers to relapse back to

23   smoking. That's why we advise people to remove

24   them.

25        Q.   I see. Telling your family and friends is 4976

1    a trigger?

2        A.   Being around other people who are smokers

3   is a trigger or committing, obviously, telling

4   others that you're going to quit smoking is --

5        Q.   Telling others that you're -- I'm sorry, I

6   interrupted. Are you finished?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Okay. Telling others that you are going

9   to quit smoking is a form of -- an expression of

10   commitment to quitting; would you agree?

11         A.   I would agree.

12        Q.   Signing a contract is an expression of a

13   commitment to quit; would you agree?

14        A.   I would agree.

15        Q.   Now, when the Piendles made these various

16   New Year's resolutions, they did not attempt to get

17   any prescription for any smoking cessation aid that

18   might have been available at the time, and I realize

19   that there were limited choices.

20        A.   There was the gum, and no, there's no

21    record of getting nicotine gum.

22        Q.   They didn't try hypnosis in connection

23   with any of these quit attempts, correct?

24        A.   They didn't try hypnosis, but probably a

25   good thing because there is no evidence that 4977

1   hypnosis helps you quit smoking.

2        Q.   They didn't go to a smoking cessation

3   clinic like the one you run, did they?

4        A.   No.

5        Q.   And they never asked for any assistance

6   from anyone, as far as you could tell, right?

7        A.   No, just each other to make the resolution

8   to quit smoking.

9        Q.   And do you believe the Piendles were

10   committed to quitting in association with these

11    various New Year's resolutions, even though they

12   didn't do most of the things or maybe none of the

13   things that you recommend as part of your "Smart

14   Move" pamphlet?

15        A.   Yes, I do. I think they were committed

16   and there were a variety of strategies used by

17   Mr. Piendle, such as chewing gum, chewed on straws

18   and toothpicks, not having cigarettes in the house,

19   cutting back or delaying lighting up, these are all

20   kinds of strategies that are used for quitting

21    smoking.

22        Q.   If a student in one of your smoking

23   cessation classes came to you and said, you know, I

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=362
24   want some advice on how to quit smoking, but the

25   student said, I don't want to fill out that 4978

1    contract, I don't want to throw out my lighters, I

2   don't want to throw out my ashtrays, I don't want to

3   tell anyone that I'm going to try to quit, I don't

4   want to take any medication, I don't even want to

5   participate in the class, would you take his quit

6   attempt seriously?

7        A.   Sure.

8        Q.   And from your perspective to judge whether

9   or not somebody has made a serious attempt to quit

10   smoking, you just ask them whether they have ever

11    attempted, right?

12        A.   Well, I certainly ask that question

13   because that's an important marker, and I've done

14   research where we've looked at the experience that

15   people have quitting for less than 24 hours and more

16   than 24 hours, and we find that people who tend to

17   be most addicted often don't make it 24 hours, it's

18   a very common thing. I tracked the relapse profiles

19   of smokers and have written papers on that topic.

20        Q.   Let me try to do this in bites. Isn't it

21    true that you judge whether a particular attempt to

22   quit is serious or not by asking the person whether

23   they tried to quit smoking?

24        A.   It's one basis for it, yes.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that all they have to do is 4979

1    say, yes, I have tried to quit smoking and the

2   attempt is a serious one, in your opinion?

3        A.   Yes, because behavior is the best

4   predictor of future behavior.

5        Q.   Okay. So in your view, literally any

6   attempt to quit smoking is a serious one; is that

7   right?

8        A.   Any attempt that's reported as trying to

9   quit smoking, yeah, absolutely.

10        Q.   Thank you.

11              You discussed yesterday during your --

12   well, maybe not yesterday. It might have been the

13   day before. You discussed in your direct testimony

14   that one of the things you look at in assessing

15   severity of addiction was the smoker's ability to

16   control their smoking in various settings. Do you

17   remember that?

18        A.   Yes.

19        Q.   Okay. And you know that Mr. Piendle would

20   sit through entire meals without smoking, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   You know that there's no evidence that he

23   got up in the middle of the night to smoke, true?

24        A.   That's right.

25        Q.   You know he would go to church services

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=363
4980

1    and he wouldn't get up and leave during the service

2   in order to smoke, right?

3        A.   Correct.

4        Q.   Same thing is true of movies, he would go

5   to the movies and sit through the entire movie and

6   didn't go out to smoke during the middle of it,

7   right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And you also know that his family referred

10   to him repeatedly as being a strong-willed and

11    decisive guy?

12        A.   Correct.

13        Q.   Do you recall Mr. Piendle saying,

14   Mr. Piendle, once he sets his mind to something, he

15   can do it?

16        A.   I recall that.

17        Q.   Okay.

18        A.   Except for quitting smoking.

19        Q.   Well, he did it, didn't he?

20        A.   Eventually.

21         Q.   Okay. Mr. Piendle never told anybody he

22   was unable to quit smoking, did he?

23        A.   Not that I recall.

24        Q.   He never told anybody, I can't quit

25   smoking, did he? 4981

1        A.   I don't recall any testimony to that

2   effect.

3        Q.   There's no evidence that he ever went to

4   somebody and said, hey, I'm addicted?

5        A.   I think his daughter felt that her dad was

6   addicted to cigarettes.

7        Q.   Answer the question, please.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: I move to strike as

9        nonresponsive, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: I will strike the testimony.

11         The question was whether Mr. Piendle had told

12        anyone whether he was addicted, not what his

13        daughter had said.

14             MR. BIERSTEKER: That's correct.

15     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

16        Q.   Let me just reask the question. There's

17   no evidence that Mr. Piendle said to anyone ever,

18   I'm addicted?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Thank you.

21              Now, you talked about a couple of

22   different tests, I think, during the course of your

23   direct examination, one of them was the DSM-IV, the

24   manual that the psychiatrists use, the diagnostic

25   and statistical manual? 4982

1        A.   I'm not sure we talked about it, but I'm

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=364
2   familiar with it.

3        Q.   Let me just ask the question: You did not

4   apply that particular diagnostic tool used by

5   psychiatrists and psychologists in order to assess

6   whether or not Mr. Piendle was addicted, did you?

7        A.   I did not apply it because it's not as

8   valid as the tool that I applied.

9        Q.   Okay. You did not use the Fagerstrom test

10   to assess the severity of Mr. Piendle's dependence,

11    did you?

12        A.   Well, I'm familiar with the Fagerstrom

13   test and I used elements of Fagerstrom, which are

14   contained in the Heaviness of Smoking Index.

15        Q.   Sir, my question was: Did you use the

16   Fagerstrom test to assess the level of Mr. Piendle's

17   dependence?

18        A.   No.

19        Q.   Thank you.

20        A.   That's not entirely correct, actually.

21    I'm familiar with all these measures, they're all

22   very similar. But I explicitly talk about, in my

23   notes, which I testified to in my deposition, the

24   Heaviness of Smoking Index.

25        Q.   You know, sir, isn't it true, and I can 4983

1    get it out, if you want, that in your deposition you

2   said you didn't use the Fagerstrom test in this

3   particular case?

4        A.   I did not use the six-item Fagerstrom

5   Tolerance Scale, no.

6        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

7             Now, what you did use was what you refer

8   to as the Heaviness of Smoking Index, right?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   And the Fagerstrom test and your Heaviness

11    of Smoking Index is used to assess the level of

12   addiction, right?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And your Heaviness of Smoking Index

15   basically consists of two of the six questions that

16   are in the Fagerstrom test, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   It's how much you smoke every day and when

19   you have your first cigarette in the morning?

20        A.   Right.

21         Q.   Isn't it true that any smoker to whom your

22   Heaviness of Smoking Index is given will get a score

23   between zero and six?

24        A.   Well, the scale goes from zero to six,

25   that's right. 4984

1         Q.   So if it's applied to somebody, they get a

2   score between zero and six, right?

3        A.   If it's applied to you, you'd get a score

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=365
4   between zero and six. If you apply it to anybody,

5   you get a score between zero and six.

6        Q.   If you get a six, you're dependent, right?

7        A.   Actually, labels that are applied are

8   depending on where you fall with the score. A six

9   would be, you know, the highest level on that scale

10   or heavily dependent.

11         Q.   And if you get a zero, you are dependent?

12        A.   If you get a zero, you're not dependent.

13        Q.   Don't you have a light nicotine dependence

14   if you have a zero?

15        A.   It goes, I believe, up to ten cigarettes,

16   and if you're smoking zero cigarettes, then you

17   would get a zero.

18        Q.   Ten or fewer cigarettes gives you a zero,

19   right?

20        A.   Well, ten or fewer. If you're smoking

21    zero, you get a zero.

22        Q.   You get a zero. And if you get a zero,

23   you have light dependence, right?

24        A.   That's just a label that they apply

25   because it's applied to smokers, it's not applied to 4985

1   nonsmokers.

2        Q.   And that's the point, isn't it? If you

3   apply this test, if one were, and I realize you may

4   disagree and say this is something that shouldn't be

5   done, but if you gave your Heaviness of Smoking

6   Index test to someone who had never smoked a

7   cigarette in their life, the answer would be zero,

8   right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And they would be lightly dependent?

11         A.   No, that's a label. I didn't put the

12   label on there. They would be a zero.

13        Q.   Isn't it true that regardless of what his

14   smoking behavior was, at least on the Heaviness of

15   Smoking Index, Mr. Piendle could not have escaped

16   being labeled as dependent or addicted?

17        A.   Well, he was a daily smoker, which is the

18   first criteria that I looked at, and then I applied

19   the Heaviness of Smoking Index, and by my

20   assessment, he would score either a five or six,

21    which was among the highest categories on that

22   scale, which has been validated through studies that

23   I've done on others, against the DSM-IV, against

24   Fagerstrom, tends to be a better predictor of

25   struggles that people have to quit smoking. 4986

1         Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that there's no

2   category on the Heaviness of Smoking Index that says

3   not addicted?

4        A.   That is true.

5        Q.   So at least as to somebody like

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=366
6   Mr. Piendle, who is smoking, there's no way that

7   they can take that test and avoid being anything

8   other than dependent?

9        A.   Well, the labels are meaningless, it's

10   really just the scores. It means the five, where

11    you fall on that scale.

12        Q.   It's your test, Doctor, isn't it?

13        A.   Actually, it's a test that was developed

14   by Lynn Kozlowski.

15        Q.   And it's a test you use?

16        A.   Yeah, it's an excellent test. It's a very

17   good screener of --

18        Q.   It's a test you use, yes, thank you.

19             You talked about cigarette companies'

20   design modification to cigarettes related to

21    nicotine. Do you remember that?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.   And, of course, you've never designed a

24   commercial cigarette, have you?

25        A.   No. 4987

1         Q.   You've never designed even a prototype

2   cigarette, right?

3        A.   No, I don't design cigarettes.

4        Q.   You don't hold any patents in cigarette

5   design or construction, do you?

6        A.   No, I don't.

7        Q.   You don't have a degree in chemistry,

8   right?

9        A.   No.

10        Q.   Or biology, right?

11         A.   No.

12        Q.   Or physics?

13        A.   Or physics.

14        Q.   Right? And you talked a little bit, I

15   thought, about tar to nicotine ratios?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   And the strategy to reduce the tar to

18   nicotine ratio, to increase nicotine relative to tar

19   in a cigarette, wasn't a secret, was it?

20        A.   No, it has been discussed for about 40

21    years.

22        Q.   Right. And it was a strategy that had

23   been discussed by scientists and members of the

24   public health community for potentially making

25   cigarettes safer, right? 4988

1        A.   Right, essentially, giving people nicotine

2   without tar.

3        Q.   Right. Exactly. Because it is the tar in

4   cigarette smoke that is thought to contribute to

5   most of the smoking-related diseases, not the

6   nicotine, right?

7        A.   That's true.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=367
8        Q.   All right. So the idea was smokers smoke

9   for nicotine, right?

10        A.   That's right.

11         Q.   And what you'd like to try and do is to

12   design a cigarette that would provide smokers with

13   nicotine, but with as little of the harmful tar as

14   possible, right?

15        A.   Yeah, without the smoke.

16        Q.   Without the smoke, right, okay. And that

17   was something that was published in leading

18   journals, such as the Lancet and the British Medical

19   Journal back in the 1970s, wasn't it?

20        A.   Yes, Dr. Russell.

21         Q.   Dr. Russell, you got it. And it's also

22   something that Sir Richard Doll suggested, right?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And that was also in the 1970s, wasn't it,

25   if you remember? 4989

1        A.   He's published hundreds of papers. I

2   don't know which of his papers might have mentioned

3   that.

4        Q.   Do you remember whether or not the idea of

5   altering this tar to nicotine ratio was something

6   that was discussed in the 1981 Surgeon General's

7   report as a potential approach for making a safer

8   cigarette?

9        A.   It was, that was the report on the

10   changing cigarette.

11         Q.   Now, isn't it true that at least my

12   client, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, attempted to

13   do that, to change that tar and nicotine ratio?

14        A.   They certainly had a large number of

15   studies that talked about maintaining nicotine

16   levels while trying to lower tar.

17        Q.   And that was the reasonable thing for them

18   to try and do, wasn't it?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. May

20        we have a time frame?

21              THE COURT: Yes.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: Starting in the 1970s.

23        A.   They did talk about it in the 1970s. I

24   just saw a document in 1970s, I believe authored by

25   Dr. Teague to Dr. Senkus. 4990

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   That's correct. And you talked about that

3   in your direct examination.

4        A.   Correct.

5        Q.   Okay. Here is my question: That was a

6   reasonable thing for the company to try and do,

7   wasn't it?

8        A.   To maintain nicotine dependence, no.

9        Q.   No, I didn't ask that question. I said to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=368
10   alter the tar to nicotine ratio.

11         A.   Well, they -- it was something they talked

12   about. I wouldn't say it was a reasonable thing to

13   do. The reasonable thing to do would be to remove

14   the one chemical in the cigarettes, which would be

15   nicotine, that kept people smoking.

16        Q.   Is it your testimony that it was not a

17   reasonable thing for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

18   to follow suggestions that were being made in the

19   scientific literature on how to make a safer -- a

20   potentially safer cigarette?

21         A.   No, that would mischaracterize my

22   testimony. My testimony in my characterization of

23   the scientific literature, because of the massive

24   health problems related to smoking, would be to make

25   a product that did not deliver the smoke, if you 4991

1   were going to give the nicotine, or take the

2   nicotine out so that people wouldn't repeatedly

3   expose themselves to the smoke.

4        Q.   So it's got to be all or nothing, black or

5   white, in your view?

6        A.   Yes, it does.

7        Q.   There's no room for marginal error?

8        A.   That was pretty well-defined, I believe,

9   in another document that I shared from Dr. Senkus

10   that talked about smoking compensation.

11         Q.   With all respect, Doctor, I'm not asking

12   you about other documents, I'm asking you for your

13   opinions. I'm asking you, you're saying it would be

14   unreasonable for tobacco companies to attempt to

15   make marginal improvements in the safety or

16   riskiness of their products?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

19             Another document from Reynolds you talked

20   about in your direct examination related to design,

21    which was Plaintiffs Exhibit 1233, which was a 1973

22   memo from Frank Colby to Mr. Blevins regarding a

23   larger share of the youth market. Do you remember

24   that one?

25        A.   I do. 4992

1         Q.   Now, Mr. Piendle was 32 when that memo was

2   written, right?

3        A.   That's correct.

4        Q.   He was certainly not a youth, right?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   And you know that the author of that memo,

7   Dr. Colby, spent his career in the research and

8   development department at Reynolds, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   Like Dr. Teague, Dr. Colby was not ever in

11    the marketing department of the company, correct?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=369
12        A.   He was in the research part of the

13   department, is my understanding.

14        Q.   Yes. He was not in the marketing

15   department, correct?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   No-

18        A.   He was not in the marketing.

19        Q.   It might be partially my fault for the

20   question. Dr. Colby never worked in the marketing

21    department; is that true?

22        A.   That's my understanding, that's true.

23        Q.   I think you said yesterday that you

24   thought Dr. Colby was Dr. Teague's boss. Do you

25   remember that? 4993

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   Are you confident of that? Wasn't it the

3   other way around?

4        A.   I believe at the time this memo was

5   written, he was the boss, but I'm not perfectly

6   confident about it, but I believe he was more senior

7   than Dr. Teague.

8        Q.   Isn't it true that you have no information

9   available to you to suggest that Reynolds ever

10   implemented the suggestion that was made in that

11    memo?

12        A.   That's true. The design of the cigarettes

13   is proprietary.

14        Q.   Well, you're reverse engineering all the

15   time, aren't you?

16        A.   We started our reverse engineering in 2004

17   and have the largest lab doing that, but that was in

18   2004. So we don't have the products back to the

19   time that this memo was written in 1973.

20        Q.   Uh-huh. You reviewed company documents,

21    didn't you?

22        A.   The company documents that I have reviewed

23   on product designs, I've had to sign confidentiality

24   agreements for because it's considered proprietary

25   information. 4994

1         Q.   Sir, isn't it true that you can find no

2   evidence in any of the materials that you reviewed,

3   including the internal documents of R.J. Reynolds

4   Tobacco Company, that Dr. Colby's recommendations

5   that were made in the memo that you discussed in

6   your direct examination were ever followed up on in

7   any way?

8             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

9             I would like a statement for the record

10        that R.J. Reynolds is releasing this witness

11         from any obligation of a confidentiality

12        agreement that has previously been imposed upon

13        him to allow him to freely answer that question

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=370
14        in its entirety.

15             THE COURT: Response.

16             MR. BIERSTEKER: I have no idea what

17        Mr. Scarola is talking about. But if he makes

18        that representation, I am not in a position to

19        dispute it. I am just asking the gentleman

20        questions.

21              MR. SCAROLA: May we approach?

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: It's interrupting the

23        cross-examination.

24             THE COURT: The pending question is? 25

4995

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   The pending question is: In fact, based

3   upon your review of R.J. Reynolds' documents,

4   whether they were subject to a confidentiality

5   agreement or not, based upon the reverse engineering

6   work that you described to the ladies and gentlemen

7   of the jury, you have no evidence, do you, that

8   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company followed up in any way

9   on the suggestion that was made in the Colby

10   exhibit, Plaintiffs Exhibit 1233, that you

11    discussed with the jury yesterday?

12             MR. SCAROLA: And my request, your Honor,

13        is a clear statement from R.J. Reynolds that

14        this witness is released from any contractual

15        obligation R.J. Reynolds imposed upon him.

16             THE COURT: Let me ask --

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Let's address this at

18        sidebar, I think, your Honor.

19             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

20        held out of the presence of the jury:)

21              THE COURT: Well, first, I'd like to know

22        whether the question is even covered.

23        Shouldn't the witness answer the question as to

24        whether it's covered by confidentiality? If

25        it's not, it's a nonissue and we don't need to 4996

1        take it up. I think we should ask the witness

2        whether it's covered by confidentiality.

3             MR. SCAROLA: That's fine.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: This witness had

5        consulted with the company in connection with

6        the cigarettes that he did, but did not burn

7        tobacco. I do not intend to ask him questions

8        that would call for him to reveal confidential

9        information he may have learned as part of that

10        consultation. However, later, not in

11         connection with this question, but later, when

12        it comes to talking about the level of

13        cooperation that the company's gave -- engaged

14        with the public health community, I do intend

15        to elicit from him testimony that he, in fact,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=371
16        consulted on that, but again, I do not intend

17        to get into proprietary information.

18             THE COURT: So you want a yes or no

19        whether --

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: Whether the idea

21         expressed in Dr. Colby's memo --

22             THE COURT: Was followed up.

23             MR. BIERSTEKER: Followed up on, that's

24        right.

25             THE COURT: If the witness says it calls 4997

1        for disclosure --

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: It really doesn't. He

3        may say that, but it really doesn't.

4             MR. KELLY: I would suggest, since it's

5        almost lunch, dismiss the jury, find out what

6        he's going to say outside the presence of the

7        jury. If it's not within confidentiality, we

8        move on back.

9             THE COURT: Any preference how long we

10        break for lunch, keeping in mind I want to

11         finish with this witness today? How much

12        longer does R.J. think?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, he was on the

14        stand for almost two days.

15             THE COURT: I'm not limiting, I'm just

16        asking.

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: I think I can give you a

18        guess, maybe a better read after lunch, my

19        guess is I'm about halfway.

20             THE COURT: Is an hour too short for lunch

21         for everyone?

22             MR. SCAROLA: As long as Mr. Henk doesn't

23        have a variety of mistrial motions that consume

24        a significant portion of the hour, an hour is

25        fine. 4998

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4             THE COURT: Is the jury okay with just an

5        hour today?

6             Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going

7        to take our lunchtime break now. I would like

8        to ask -- is an hour sufficient time for lunch?

9        We'll do an hour today. We'll be back at 1:25.

10             Remember my important instruction not to

11         discuss the case with anyone, not to view any

12        media, should there be any media coverage you

13        come in contact with. No contact with anyone

14        associated with the case, and we'll be back at

15         1:25.

16             I'll remind our witness that you are under

17        oath, not to discuss your testimony with anyone

18        over the break, and we'll see you back at 1:25.

19        Thank you.

20             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

21         after which the following proceedings were

22        held:)

23             THE COURT: Okay. We'll spend a moment on

24        the issue that we just left off with.

25             Dr. Cummings, there was a question, the 4999

1        last pending question from counsel for

2        R.J. Reynolds regarding your review of the

3        Colby Exhibit 1233, whether there was any

4        evidence that R.J. Reynolds followed up on any

5        of the suggestions in this exhibit, and the

6        question is, in answering that question, which

7        may be a yes or a no, does that call for you to

8        disclose anything that you believe is covered

9        by this confidentiality agreement, and would

10        you like the question asked again so you can be

11         clear?

12             THE WITNESS: I can answer the question,

13        and the answer would be no. I can answer the

14        question without disclosing information.

15             THE COURT: Okay. So I'll permit counsel,

16        when we return, to ask that question. Was

17        there anything else you wanted to discuss in

18        that regard so we can get that cleared up as it

19        relates to confidentiality?

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: I don't think I'm going

21         to ask him anything that would elicit

22        confidential information and that has not

23        already been asked of him in a public forum.

24             THE COURT: Okay. So with respect to that

25        question, I'll allow that question to be asked. 5000

1        Was there anything further on that topic?

2             MR. SCAROLA: Not directly on that topic,

3        but Mr. Biersteker seems to be going in a

4        direction that is attempting to develop good

5        company evidence, and to the extent that he is,

6        it is plaintiffs position that good company

7        evidence in this phase of the proceeding must

8        have some nexus to Charlie Piendle. In the

9        absence of that nexus, good company evidence,

10        that is evidence to indicate a lesser degree of

11         reprehensibility, is evidence that is second

12        stage, not first stage evidence. You don't get

13        into general good conduct until the second

14        phase. If it relates to Charlie Piendle, we

15        can get it in in the first phase.

16             THE COURT: Response.

17             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, that is

18        preposterous. These are the same exhibits that

19        the witness used. What's good for the goose is

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=373
20        good for the gander. If he wants to talk about

21         exhibits to suggest reprehensibility, which

22        your Honor allowed over objection based upon

23        the nexus issue, I am certainly entitled to

24        follow up on the very same exhibits in my

25        cross-examination to suggest that there was 5001

1         good company conduct.

2             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, the -

3             THE COURT: Just on that issue, I am not

4        going to make a ruling until there's a

5        particular question to which there's a

6        particular objection based on that issue.

7             MR. SCAROLA: I can give your Honor just a

8        broad example so we can place this in context.

9        If we are talking about some evidence about

10        disclosures the company made during the period

11         of time that Charlie Piendle was smoking, that

12        would tend to reduce reprehensibility of the

13        acts that have a nexus to Charlie Piendle. If

14        we're talking about changes in cigarette design

15        that occurred after Charlie Piendle stopped

16        smoking, that could have no nexus. If we're

17        talking about all these new products we're

18        trying to develop in the year 2010 that we

19        weren't trying to develop --

20             MR. SALES: In Sweden.

21              MR. SCAROLA: Sorry, in Sweden that we

22        weren't trying to develop prior to 1989, there

23        could be no nexus to Charlie Piendle. That's

24        just an illustration of the concern that I

25        have. 5002

1              MR. KELLY: Your Honor, it is my view, our

2        view, Philip Morris' view, that much of the

3        testimony that Dr. Cummings gave that postdated

4         1989, which in large part involved allegations

5        of the company's misconduct, in some instances

6        up to the current time, with respect to their

7        product design specifically, was objected to

8        when the question was asked and when the answer

9        was given on direct examination, and motions to

10        strike were made on the grounds that such

11         testimony violated Williams and State Farm and

12        had no nexus to Mr. Piendle.

13             Those objections were overruled and those

14        motions to strike were denied, and the

15        testimony came in before the jury.

16             It is only because the objections were

17        overruled and the motions were denied and the

18        jury was allowed to hear that evidence that

19        this same scope of information is going to be

20        covered on cross-examination.

21              If our objections had been sustained, if

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=374
22        the scope of the witness' testimony had been

23        restricted, as we believe it should have been,

24        only that conduct that caused harm to

25        Mr. Piendle, whatever that might have been, 5003

1        then there wouldn't be any necessity to ask

2        questions beyond 1989.

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4             MR. KELLY: So in light of that objection,

5        in light of that admission, admission now that

6        the evidence the plaintiffs adduced from this

7        witness on direct examination is irrelevant to

8        this phase of the case, we move for a mistrial,

9        your Honor.

10             Obviously, a due process violation of

11        Williams/State Farm. It's now admitted. It's

12        now admitted, your Honor. We knew they were

13        doing it improperly, and now it's been

14        admitted. We need a mistrial, your Honor.

15        This is an abuse of the system and violation of

16        our due process rights.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Would you like me to respond

18        to the mistrial motion?

19             THE COURT: Brief response.

20             MR. SCAROLA: Brief response is that every

21         element of proof adduced during the plaintiffs

22        case had a nexus to Charlie Piendle, including

23        that evidence as to conduct that occurred

24        subsequent to 1989, because that evidence was

25        evidence of the continuation of exactly the 5004

1         same kind of conduct that had caused harm to

2        Charlie Piendle.

3             Design of products after Charlie Piendle

4        stopped smoking in 1989 has no nexus to Charlie

5        Piendle. That's the important distinction. We

6        have, in fact, limited our testimony during

7        this phase to evidence that is relevant and

8        material to the reprehensibility of the conduct

9        that caused injury to Charlie Piendle and the

10        length of time that that very conduct

11         continued. And that's the important

12        distinction that I think counsel has

13        overlooked, your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Okay.

15             MR. SCAROLA: The basis upon which I

16        understood the Court was admitting that

17        evidence.

18             THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to deny the

19        motion for mistrial. I'll entertain objections

20        as they are raised with respect to evidence

21         elicited at any point, but particularly if

22        there is evidence elicited post 1989 that

23        plaintiff may believe is good conduct evidence,

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=375
24        I'll have to hear it, rule on it step by step.

25             Motion for mistrial denied, and we'll come 5005

1        back at 1:25.

2             MR. HENK: Your Honor, Philip Morris would

3        make a request that Mr. Scarola cease in front

4        of the jury offering things like a waiver of a

5        confidentiality provision. That is totally

6        inappropriate in any courtroom in the United

7        States to do that in front of a jury.

8        Mr. Scarola knows that.

9             Whenever I wanted to do anything in the

10        cross-examination of the plaintiff, he ran up

11         to the bench as quickly as he could, even

12        though Mr. Scarola wasn't on the witness, and

13        he was permitted to do it, and he's doing this

14        repeatedly in front of the jury, knowing that

15        it prejudices us. It's totally inappropriate.

16             I ask that he be instructed not to do it

17        anymore, and that the jury be instructed that

18        what Mr. Scarola did was inappropriate, and

19        they should disregard it.

20             THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to

21         instruct the jury on that, and I believe we

22        curtailed the discussion of the

23        confidentiality, and that's why we're having

24        our lunch break at this time, so we can discuss

25        it outside the hearing of the jury. 5006

1              MR. HENK: My request for an instruction

2        as to Mr. Scarola is denied?

3             THE COURT: We'll be in recess until 1:25.

4             Yes, that request is denied.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm sorry, what time,

6        your Honor?

7             THE COURT:  1:25.

8             (Thereupon, a lunch recess was had at

9         12:35 p.m., after which the proceedings

10        continued in Volume XXXII.) 11

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=379
5     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

6        Q.   I think when we broke, I asked you a

7   question and there had been some discussion by

8   counsel and I would like to reask the question,

9   which is you had testified on direct examination

10   about a 1973 memorandum from Frank Colby to a

11    Mr. Blevins, Plaintiffs Exhibit 1233, and my last

12   question about this particular exhibit is: Isn't it

13   true that in the course of your review of materials

14   in connection with this case and otherwise, you can

15   find no evidence that Dr. Colby's recommendations in

16   that memo were followed up on in any way?

17        A.   It's not true. They were followed up on

18   pH manipulation, which is talked about was followed

19   up upon by Reynolds based upon my review of their

20   business records.

21         Q.   Doctor, I couldn't help but notice that

22   you seem to be glancing down at something.

23        A.   I have all the exhibits from yesterday.

24        Q.   Why don't we take a look at your testimony

25   in the Gray trial from January 27th, 2010, on this 4744

1   very issue. Gray, January 27th, 2010, in the

2   afternoon. Sorry.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: Would your Honor like a

4        copy or not?

5             THE COURT: Yes, please, if you have an

6        extra one.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach?

8             THE COURT: Yes.

9     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

10        Q.   If you could turn, Doctor, to page 1308.

11         A.   Okay.

12        Q.   And you were asked a series of questions

13   starting on line 15 about this same document. Do

14   you see that?

15        A.   1308?

16        Q.   1308, starting at about line 15.

17        A.   Right.

18        Q.   And it started out with the question:

19    "Now, I think you said this yesterday, Dr. Colby

20   spent his life in R & D, he was not in marketing,

21    correct?"

22             You said, "Right." And the memo is to the

23   director of marketing.

24             And then the next question was:  "So the

25   guy from R & D" --4745

1              MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. This

2        is improper impeachment, the testimony is

3        entirely consistent.

4             MR. BIERSTEKER: I was trying to set some

5        context, your Honor.

6             THE COURT: It looks like 18 through 24

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=380
7        relate to the question.

8             MR. SCAROLA: If I may, may we approach

9        the bench for just a moment?

10             THE COURT: Yes.

11              (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

12        held out of the presence of the jury:)

13             MR. SCAROLA: What the witness had

14        available as of the time this deposition was

15        taken is not inconsistent with the question

16        that was asked, which asked, do you have any --

17        do you have any information that indicates that

18        they followed through. So counsel has not set

19        up a predicate that would enable him to use

20        this deposition to impeach the witness.

21              THE COURT: I'm sorry, are you saying

22        something happened between this deposition and

23        today that had been made available?

24             MR. SCAROLA: I'm saying unless something

25        happened, this is inconsistent. The fact he 4746

1         could not call to mind in January -- the fact

2        he could not call to mind at the time this

3        deposition was taken what evidence he had is

4        not inconsistent with him saying today, I can

5        tell you what the documents are that

6        demonstrate that I do know.

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: If that's his answer to

8        impeach, that's fine, but it's clearly

9        consistent with his testimony.

10             THE COURT: I'll allow it and either the

11         witness can explain it or follow up on

12        redirect.

13             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

14        concluded and the following proceedings were

15        held within the presence of the jury:)

16     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

17        Q.   Ready to continue?

18        A.   Ready.

19        Q.   You got the context, we're talking about

20   the same document, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   This excerpt from your testimony. And the

23   next question, starting on line 18 -- are you with

24   me?

25        A.   Yes. 4747

1         Q.    was:  "So the guy from R&D sent the

2   memo to the director of marketing, and I think he

3   testified yesterday that nothing happened, right?"

4             Answer:  "I testified that I don't know

5   what happened."

6             Question:  "You can find no evidence that

7   this was followed up on in any way?"

8             Answer:  "No."

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=381
9             That was testimony you gave in

10   January 2010; is that right?

11         A.   That's right.

12        Q.   Thank you.

13             Now, you mentioned pH, so let's talk about

14   that for a moment.

15             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. I

16        think that it's appropriate for the witness to

17        be given an opportunity to explain any

18        difference that may appear to exist between

19        testimony given in the past and testimony given

20        today.

21              THE COURT: As with any question, anytime

22        the witness needs to explain his answer, of

23        course, you know, that you can.

24        A.   The answer I gave to your question just a

25   few moments ago regarding this document is I am 4748

1   familiar with business records that I've reviewed

2   that talk about pH manipulation of products, which

3   is a truthful answer because there is a substantial

4   body of evidence in the business records of

5   R.J. Reynolds that talk about use of chemicals to

6   affect pH, which affects the harshness and the

7   ability to inhale the cigarettes. That was the

8   context in which I was answering the question you

9   asked regarding the document. That was a slightly

10   different question than what was asked here. I

11    don't know precisely whether it was used in the

12   Winston cigarettes in 1974 because that's

13   proprietary information and it's not been revealed.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   So let me just follow up on that

16   explanation. You have no evidence that

17   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company introduced, as

18   Dr. Colby was proposing, a retrocigarette in an

19   effort to appeal to the youth market, correct?

20        A.   I know that --1 don't know that answer

21   precisely because that is proprietary information as

22   to the formulations in any given time of the

23   cigarettes.

24        Q.   So you don't know?

25        A.   I don't. 4749

1         Q.   Fair enough.

2             And then you mentioned pH. Let's talk

3   about that now. You talked about pH also yesterday

4   in your direct examination, you talked about

5   nicotine kick?

6        A.   I think it's mentioned here at the bottom

7   of this document, additional nicotine kick.

8        Q.   Right. Okay. And isn't it true that some

9   in the public health community, in fact, advocate

10   increasing the pH of cigarette smoke in order to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=382
11    make what was thought potentially to be a safer

12   cigarette?

13        A.   If you have the pH high enough, the smoke

14   is too irritating and is hard to inhale, and that

15   has been discussed as one of the explanations that

16   certain kinds of tobacco products, like cigars,

17   which typically have a high pH are hard to inhale,

18   and people that only smoke cigars typically smoke

19   them on an infrequent basis and don't seem to have

20   the same health consequences that come along with

21    smoking cigarettes.

22        Q.   Do you know if that was an idea that was

23   proposed by, among others, Dr. Gori, when he was at

24   the National Cancer Institute in the 1970s?

25        A.   I don't. Dr. Gori? 4750

1         Q.   Gori, G-O-R-I.

2        A.   Dr. Gori talked about lowering the tar

3   levels.

4        Q.   Yes. Do you know if he also talked about

5   pH?

6        A.   He talked about a variety of the things

7   through the tobacco working group period, yes.

8        Q.   Do you know whether or not he specifically

9   talked about raising the pH of cigarette smoke in an

10   effort to make a potentially safer product?

11         A.I don't recall that offhand.

12        Q.   That's fine. The idea that ammonia can be

13   used to speed up the delivery of nicotine to the

14   brain is just a theory, isn't it?

15        A.   Yes, it is.

16        Q.   In fact, isn't it true that at pH levels

17   below roughly 6 1/2, the Surgeon General has found

18   that there is essentially no free or unbound

19   nicotine in the smoke from cigarettes?

20        A.   I'm not sure which report you're referring

21    to.

22        Q.   Well, 1979, 1981; do you know?

23        A.   No, I'm not sure which report you're

24   referring to.

25        Q.   Let me just ask the question to see 4751

1   whether you know, and I realize that this is -- let

2   me ask the question. Isn't there a curve that shows

3   how much nicotine in cigarette smoke would be bound

4   or unbound at different levels of pH?

5        A.   I don't know about the curve, but I do

6   know that I've seen and read documents in scientific

7   reports that talk about the amount of free or

8   unbound nicotine being different at different

9   pH levels.

10        Q.   Okay. You don't know the name of that

11    curve?

12        A.   No.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=383
13        Q.   And that's because you're not a chemist?

14        A.   I'm not a chemist.

15        Q.   Do you know whether or not it was reported

16   by the Surgeon General that at the pH level of smoke

17   in commercial cigarettes in this country, there is

18   virtually no --just wait -- unbound or unprotonated

19   nicotine in cigarette smoke?

20        A.   I'm not familiar with that, no.

21         Q.   Would you like to take a look at the 1988

22   Surgeon General's report that you have reviewed to

23   see if that's commented on?

24        A.   Sure.

25        Q.   If I could just have this excerpt, do you 4752

1   have it?

2             MR. SALES: I have the full-blown sitting

3        right here.

4     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

5        Q.   It'sAS34.

6             MR. SALES: What page are you referring?

7             MR. BIERSTEKER: I'm going to refer to

8        page 29, and I'll just give the doctor an

9        excerpt, if that's okay.

10             Your Honor, may I?

11              THE COURT: Yes.

12        A.   Thank you.

13     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

14        Q.   You're welcome.

15        A.   What page are you --

16        Q.   We're going to be looking at page 29.

17        A.   Okay.

18        Q.   And if you could take just a moment to

19   read the second -- maybe we can just show this.

20   This is the'88 report?

21         A.   Right.

22        Q.   And first, they discuss the pH of the

23   smoke from flue-cured tobacco, the predominant

24   tobacco used in most American cigarettes, and they

25   say that the range is roughly between 6.0 and 5.5? 4753

1        A.   That's what it says, yes.

2        Q.   And then if we can have the next sentence,

3   please. At these pHs, the nicotine is almost

4   completely ionized, right?

5        A.   That's right.

6        Q.   And that means bound, right?

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   Okay. So-

9        A.   The problem with that is it's a

10   '74 reference, so it's rather dated.

11         Q.   I thought the 1988 Surgeon General's

12   report was an attempt to establish the consensus of

13   scientific information with respect to the topic

14   being discussed at the time it was published?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=384
15        A.   It's a compilation of the evidence that's

16   in the published literature, peer-reviewed, and

17   it -- that's what it is. And so I would attest to

18   the fact that it's not a lot in the published

19   literature, at least certainly there was not at the

20   time that report was published on pH level of

21    tobacco or different tobacco products, for that

22   matter, and that particular reference is to

23   Brunnemann and Hoffman, 1974, who were doing a lot

24   of the research on tobacco products at the American

25   Health Foundation. Dietrich Hoffman is a well-known 4754

1    chemist and has published a lot of constituents in

2   tobacco smoke, so I know Dr. Hoffman very well.

3        Q.   Would it refresh your recollection if I

4   told you that the name of the curve was the

5   Henderson-Hasselbalch curve? Does that make sense

6   to you?

7        A.   I've heard that, now that you mention

8   that, but it didn't come to my mind when you asked

9   me about it before.

10        Q.   Okay. So do you have any evidence as to

11    what the pH from the smoke from the R.J. Reynolds

12   Tobacco Company cigarettes that Mr. Piendle smoked,

13   what that pH was?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   How about Philip Morris cigarettes that he

16   smoked?

17        A.   No.

18        Q.   Okay.

19        A.   Because it varied over time, that's one

20   thing that we have learned is the products changed

21    repeatedly, and my testing, which has begun in 2000,

22   shows that they change over time.

23        Q.   Right. It's a natural product and it's

24   hard to keep it all the same all the time, right?

25        A.   It's not a natural product. There's 4755

1   manmade constituents in the products, such as

2   reconstituted tobacco.

3        Q.   Different years of tobacco can differ

4   significantly in terms of the amount of nicotine,

5   for example?

6        A.   It can, and the process of flue-curing and

7   use of additives can affect that.

8        Q.   Let's talk about denicotinized cigarettes,

9   something that you mentioned earlier today, and I

10   think also yesterday. I think you said the company

11    is good at taking the nicotine out of the

12   cigarettes, right?

13        A.   That's true.

14        Q.   And one of the ideas you proposed was

15    100 percent reconstituted tobacco cigarette with all

16   of the nicotine and tobacco flavorants removed,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=385
17   right?

18        A.   I think I was asked some questions in that

19   you could take the nicotine out of the reconstituted

20   tobacco and not reapply it.

21         Q.   Now, do you have any idea what the

22   consumer acceptability of a 100 percent

23   reconstituted tobacco cigarette would be even if it

24   had nicotine?

25        A.   No. 4756

1         Q.   As to nicotine-free cigarettes, you

2   believe, do you not, that they are not commercially

3   feasible?

4        A.   I disagree with that. There is actually a

5   product made by one of the manufacturers that has

6   virtually no nicotine in it through genetic

7   engineering of the tobacco; in other words, growing

8   tobacco that genetically doesn't have nicotine or

9   very low levels of nicotine in it.

10        Q.   What's that product?

11         A.   Quest. And it's specifically Quest 3, and

12   Quest 1 and 2 have nicotine because they use

13   blending of products that have nicotine in the

14   tobacco.

15        Q.   Isn't it true that there have been a

16   number of denicotinized cigarettes either because

17   the nicotine has been removed from the tobacco or

18   that were made of something else, like lettuce, that

19   have been marketed from time to time, but that none

20   of them were commercially successful?

21         A.   Lettuce is not tobacco, but there are --

22   there have been efforts to test, you know, nicotine,

23   very low level nicotine cigarettes. I recall

24   business records of one of the defendants, Philip

25   Morris, dating back into the early '60s where they 4757

1   were testing very low nicotine cigarettes, but not

2   for commercial application.

3        Q.   Isn't it true that in 1964, the Surgeon

4   General reported in a report that you discussed that

5   denicotinized tobacco has not found general public

6   acceptance as a substitute for conventional

7   cigarettes with nicotine?

8        A.   They did say that in their report.

9        Q.   And that has not changed over time, has

10   it?

11         A.   That report hasn't changed, no.

12        Q.   Okay. For example, in the 1950s and '60s,

13   there was a cigarette --1 think it was called King

14   Sanio?

15        A.   Sano.

16        Q.   Sano, thank you.

17             -- that was essentially denicotinized,

18   right?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=386
19        A.   No. That was a product sold in the

20   mid-1950s and it had low levels of nicotine, but

21    sufficient -- in fact, higher than most ultra-light

22   cigarettes today based on machine smoking criteria.

23        Q.   There's no evidence that Mr. Piendle ever

24   bought or smoked King Sanio cigarettes?

25        A.   Sano. 4758

1         Q.   Sano. I keep saying that.

2        A.   Very few people did because the company

3   that manufactured that found it very difficult to

4   get the shelf space to sell the product.

5        Q.   Well, in the late 1980s, there was another

6   denicotinized cigarette called Next, right?

7        A.   That's correct.

8        Q.   And Next was made by Philip Morris, wasn't

9   it?

10        A.   It was.

11         Q.   They could get shelf space, couldn't they?

12        A.   They did in a handful of test markets

13   where they tested that product.

14        Q.   And you thought the introduction of the

15   Next product was a good idea?

16        A.   Yes, I did.

17        Q.   There's no evidence that that product was

18   one that was ever purchased or smoked by

19   Mr. Piendle, is it?

20        A.   No. I think the only location where it

21    was sold here in Florida was Tampa, on a very brief

22   test market, New Haven, Connecticut, and Richmond,

23   Virginia were the three test markets.

24        Q.   It was not commercially successful, was

25   it? 4759

1        A.   It was withdrawn, although it captured

2   substantial market share in those test markets, but

3   it was withdrawn.

4        Q.   You have no evidence that Mr. Piendle ever

5   smoked a denicotinized cigarette, do you?

6        A.   No, I don't have any evidence of that.

7        Q.   Let's switch gears a little bit. Would

8   you agree with me that cigarette smoking has been

9   one of the most studied causes -- cigarette smoking

10   has been one of the most studied causes of disease

11    in human history?

12        A.   I would agree with that.

13        Q.   Okay. In fact, health issues relating to

14   cigarette smoking have received media attention for

15   about a hundred years, right?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   And we talked about Reader's Digest.

18   Isn't it true that Reader's Digest started

19   publishing articles relating to the health effects

20   of cigarettes in 1990s?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=387
21         A.   I wouldn't disagree with that.

22        Q.   You would agree, would you not, that

23   people had long referred to cigarettes using slang

24   terms such as "cancer sticks" and "coffin nails"?

25        A.   I've heard that. 4760

1         Q.   In fact, you saw the depositions that

2   Mr. Piendle used those terms, at least back when he

3   was approximately in high school, right?

4        A.   Right.

5        Q.   In the 1950s, there was extensive media

6   coverage of scientific developments in the

7   literature relating to cigarette smoking and health;

8   isn't that true?

9        A.   Scientific coverage in the scientific

10   literature?

11         Q.   Let me rephrase the question, it was kind

12   of bad. In the 1950s, there was a significant

13   amount of scientific literature that was being

14   generated about smoking and health, in particular

15   lung cancer, right?

16        A.   There was. There actually had been a fair

17   amount of scientific literature before 1950, but in

18    1950, there were, I believe, a compilation of about

19   four papers that came out, one of which came from

20   Roswell Park, actually.

21         Q.   I'm sorry. In the 1950s, there were many

22   such papers, right?

23        A.   The decade of the '50s, yes, there were

24   many more.

25        Q.   And there was lots of media attention 4761

1    given to the subject of smoking and health and, in

2   particular, smoking and lung cancer, during the

3    1950s as those studies were coming out; was there

4   not?

5        A.   There was certainly media attention given

6   to some of those studies, yes.

7        Q.   Do you know whether or not there are

8   polling data from the 1950s, indicating that

9   90 percent of folks had heard that smoking causes

10   lung cancer in that period?

11         A.   Had heard of the -- that, yes, the Gallup

12   polls, I believe, talk about having heard that there

13   have been studies on smoking and cancer.

14        Q.   And that was in 1954, the Gallup polls to

15   which you refer, right?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   Would you agree that no other health issue

18   has received more attention from the Surgeon General

19   than cigarette smoking?

20        A.   Well, Surgeon General -- you know, I don't

21   know how to measure it relative, but certainly

22   they're mandated. The Surgeon General is mandated

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=388
23   by Congress to put out a report, and that's been

24   true since the mid-1960s. So I think the Surgeon

25   General's reports are certainly one of the main 4762

1   things that that office is known for.

2        Q.   Well, let me just ask the question. It's

3   fair to say, is it not, that no health issue has

4   received more attention from the Surgeon General of

5   the United States than cigarette smoking?

6        A.   I don't know the answer to that. I mean,

7   last year they focused on HINl.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: And may I please have the

9        doctor's testimony from Clay, March 30th, 2010,

10        in the morning.

11              May I approach?

12             THE COURT: Do you have an extra one?

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Pardon me?

14             THE COURT: Do you have an extra one?

15             MR. BIERSTEKER: I do.

16     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

17        Q.   I think you'll find this on page 1324

18   trickling over to 1325.

19        A.   Okay.

20        Q.   Line 24.

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   You were asked, this is from the Clay

23   trial in March of this year.

24             Question:  "It's fair to say that no

25   health issue has received more attention from the 4763

1    Surgeon General than cigarette smoke?"

2             Answer:  "I think that's fair to say."

3             Do you remember giving that testimony?

4        A.   Yes, I do.

5        Q.   Do you disagree with it?

6        A.   No.

7        Q.   Would you agree that the 1964 Surgeon

8   General's report was widely publicized?

9        A.   I would.

10        Q.   That it was on the front pages of

11    newspapers here in the United States and on the

12   national news media of every network that existed at

13   the time?

14        A.   Yeah, it was covered on the major

15   networks.

16        Q.   We know, do we not, from Mrs. Piendle that

17   Mr. Piendle, at least during the time that she knew

18   him, loved to read the newspaper and read it cover

19   to cover every day?

20        A.   I recall that testimony.

21         Q.   Isn't it true that as a result of the

22   public health campaigns that were initiated

23   following the 1964 Surgeon General report, that

24   people started to quit smoking in increasing

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=389
25   numbers ? 4764

1        A.   It's true, cigarette consumption dropped

2   the first two months after the report and then

3   rebounded as people relapsed and went back to

4   smoking, and cigarette consumption peaked, I

5   believe, in 1966, and then prevalence of smoking has

6   declined since, particularly among men.

7        Q.   Prevalence of smoking among men has

8   declined since approximately 1964?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   And per-capita consumption, that's what

11    you're referring to when you talk about consumption?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   Per-capita consumption, which is taking

14   the total number of cigarettes sold in the country

15   and dividing it by the number of people in the

16   country, right?

17        A.   That's right.

18        Q.   Okay. Per-capita consumption started to

19   decline in approximately 1966 and has been downhill

20   ever since, true?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   And, in fact, I think you said that

23   something like 70 percent of males smoked in the

24    1950s?

25        A.   In the age cohort that Mr. Piendle was 4765

1   born in, that age cohort was 1940 to '44, they're

2   typically divided up into five-year age groups, and

3   there are studies that have looked at the percentage

4   of people who were classified as ever smokers.

5        Q.   Didn't you also say that adult males who

6   were alive at the time that Mr. Piendle's birth

7   cohort was in the 1950s, generally smoked about

8   seven out of ten? I thought that's what you said.

9        A.   Yes, 70 percent, seven out of ten.

10        Q.   And today, it's what, about 25 percent of

11    adult males smoke, something like that?

12        A.   I'd have to look at the ever smoker

13   cohort, but it's certainly a lot less. The

14   prevalence of smoking today among men is between 20

15   and 25 percent.

16        Q.   So about a third as much?

17        A.   Oh, yes, it's gone down.

18        Q.   And there are more former than current

19   smokers in the United States, right?

20        A.   That's true.

21         Q.   You've -- are you familiar with the

22   position that the American Medical Association took

23   in the 1960s that really wasn't a need for a warning

24   on cigarettes because the risks were common

25   knowledge? 4766

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=390
1        A.   I'm familiar with the fact that the

2   American Medical Association did take that position

3   at the same time they took $10 million from the

4   cigarette companies.

5        Q.   Right. $10 million to conduct research on

6   smoking and health, right?

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   Okay. Thank you. Now, the--and you're

9   familiar with Dr. Horn's statement in 1968, are you

10   not, to the effect of --1 may not get it exactly

11    right -- you can shout from the rooftops that

12   smoking is dangerous and you wouldn't be telling

13   anybody anything they didn't already know?

14        A.   I'm familiar with that statement.

15        Q.   Okay. Now, you said, I think, in response

16   to Mr. Scarola's questions yesterday, that the

17   tobacco industry's concealment of information made a

18   huge difference to the public health community. Do

19   you remember that?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   Do you remember testifying that if

22   everybody knew smoking was addictive and caused lung

23   cancer, then the companies wouldn't have been able

24   to give out free samples to advertise and to put up

25   with, what I think you referred to as power walls, 4767

1   remember that?

2        A.   Among other things.

3        Q.   Among other things, remember that?

4        A.   Sure.

5        Q.   You also testified, I believe, in response

6   to questions by Mr. Scarola, that the tobacco

7   industry has communicated honestly with the American

8   public about issues relating to smoking and health

9   and addiction since 2000?

10        A.   Well, they have commune -- they changed

11    their position, is what I was referring to. That

12   is, the denial that smoking caused cancer changed.

13   The denial that cigarette smoking was not addictive,

14   which was a position that they held did change, and

15   specifically for the defendant, Philip Morris, they

16   put up a website with a changed position in November

17   of 2000.

18        Q.   Let me ask it this way. In approximately

19   2000, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds agreed that

20   smoking causes lung cancer and a variety of other

21    diseases, true?

22        A.   Well, Reynolds did not change their

23   position quite at that time. They were a little

24   delayed in, as I recall, that their positions, as I

25   read them as stated in some other filings with 4768

1    another court case, continued to argue about

2   addiction.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=391
3        Q.   Pick a date, any date. I don't want to

4   argue with you about when precisely it was.

5   Certainly you would agree that for the last at least

6   five years, R.J. Reynolds has publicly said that

7   smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases,

8   right?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   Okay. And the same is true with respect

11    to addiction, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds

12   Tobacco Company have said for years that cigarette

13   smoking and nicotine in cigarette smoking is

14   addictive, right?

15        A.   For the last recent years, that's true.

16        Q.   Here's my question. Isn't it true today

17   that free samples of cigarettes can be given out in

18   adult venues such as nightclubs?

19        A.   That is law, that's correct.

20        Q.   Isn't it true that today there are power

21    walls in stores and convenience stores that sell

22   cigarettes?

23        A.   That's true.

24        Q.   Isn't it true today that cigarettes can be

25   advertised? 4769

1        A.   That's true.

2        Q.   Thank you.

3             By the way, there's no evidence that

4   Mr. Piendle was ever given free samples of

5   cigarettes, is there?

6        A.   No, I didn't see evidence that he had

7   received free samples.

8        Q.   I think you also said yesterday that even

9   today, even today Americans are not informed when it

10   comes to cigarette smoking. Do you remember that?

11         A.   Fully informed.

12        Q.   Fully informed. Does that apply to

13   doctors who smoke today, although in increasingly

14   smaller numbers ?

15        A.   It applies to many people that I deal

16   with. They're surprised to hear about how the

17   product is engineered.

18        Q.   The question is, are doctors -- I'm sorry,

19   I interrupted. Were you finished?

20        A.   They include doctors, they include the

21    smokers that call us. That's why I spend a fair

22   amount of my time in my clinics trying to educate

23   people about cigarettes, and I'm surprised at what

24   they don't know. But light cigarettes is just one

25   example. 4770

1         Q.   So doctors today who smoke are not, as you

2   have said, informed about the risks of smoking; is

3   that right?

4        A.   Most of the doctors don't smoke, and most

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=392
5   of what I do with doctors is try to train them how

6   to do assessments of their patients for nicotine

7   dependence, and then educate them about therapies

8   that will help their patients quit.

9        Q.   Doctor, simple question. Are doctors who

10   smoke today informed about the health risks of

11    smoking? Yes or no, please?

12        A.   I haven't done a survey of doctors'

13   knowledge. I have the public --

14        Q.   Is President Obama informed about the

15   health risks of smoking?

16        A.   I have no idea.

17        Q.   Are people who pick up their first

18   cigarette today, today, who have been taught about

19   it in school or have the benefit of all the

20   warnings, are they informed in your view?

21         A.   Informed enough to make an informed

22   choice, no.

23        Q.   Thank you.

24             Let's talk a little bit about

25   Hill & Knowlton and the Tobacco Industry Research 4771

1    Committee, or the TIRC. You discussed that with

2   Mr. Scarola yesterday?

3        A.   Yes, I did.

4        Q.   And you mentioned a public relations firm

5   called Hill & Knowlton, right?

6        A.   These correct.

7        Q.   And that was founded by John Hill, right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   And Mr. Hill was a well-known and

10   prominent public relations person in the 1950s,

11    right?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   He was very well respected, would you

14   agree?

15        A.   He was.

16        Q.   He had a reputation for integrity, did he

17   not?

18        A.   He did.

19        Q.   And then you mentioned a meeting at the

20   Plaza Hotel on December 15th, 1963, between the

21    tobacco company executives and Hill & Knowlton,

22   correct?

23        A.   Correct. There was a meeting on the 14th

24   of executives, and then a meeting on the 15th where

25   Hill & Knowlton was brought in. 4772

1         Q.   And at the meeting on the 14th, that was

2   just among the tobacco companies themselves,

3   Hill & Knowlton was not there?

4        A.   Correct.

5        Q.   And if we could pull up what has been, I

6   think, Plaintiff s 702. Defense AN 1846.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=393
7             And you discussed -- you remember

8   discussing this document with Mr. Scarola yesterday?

9             MR. SCAROLA: No objection to the

10        document, your Honor.

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you, Mr. Scarola.

12        A.   Yes.

13     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

14        Q.   If you'll turn to page 2, isn't it true

15   the tobacco companies, when they met on

16   December 14th, said they wanted to enlist the

17   cooperation of the National Institutes of Health, of

18   the U.S. Public Health Service, in working out a

19   program of scientific investigation through which

20   the facts in the present controversy would be

21    developed. You see that?

22        A.   Yes, I do.

23        Q.   And if we could go back then to the

24   meeting the next day on December 15th, which I think

25   is --1 can't remember the plaintiffs exhibit 4773

1   number. Do you remember that?

2             We've got the same -- if I could pull

3   up --1 guess it's PMU1018. And if I could have a

4   copy of that. How about  do you have an ATS425?

5   There it was, hiding.

6             And this was one that was introduced as

7   evidence by Mr. Scarola yesterday, that was the

8   memorandum by Hill & Knowlton, you remember that?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   And if we could pull up and take a look at

11   page 2, and if we could pull it up.

12             I wanted to talk to you about something I

13   don't think you discussed with Mr. Scarola

14   yesterday, which was this sentence: When they were

15   meeting with Hill & Knowlton on December 15th, 1953,

16   the memorandum says that the industry is strongly

17   convinced that there is no sound scientific basis

18   for the charges that have been made.

19             Do you see that, first of all?

20        A.   I do.

21         Q.   That was said privately, was it not?

22        A.   These are the notes from Bert Goss at

23   Hill & Knowlton.

24        Q.   At the time they were all getting together

25   at the Plaza Hotel on December 15th, 1953, nobody 4774

1    anticipated that memos like this would be out on the

2   Internet today, right?

3        A.   I'm sure they didn't anticipate there

4   would be an Internet back in 1953.

5        Q.   Might not, but otherwise publicly

6   available?

7        A.   Right.

8        Q.   And in fact, this statement that they made

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=394
9   in this private meeting to Hill & Knowlton sounds an

10   awful lot like what they said in the Frank Statement

11    when they said, "We do not believe that our products

12   are injurious to health," doesn't it?

13        A.   Yes, it does.

14        Q.   Didn't they also point out that, in the

15   next paragraph, please, that the National Cancer

16   Institute of the U.S. Public Health Administration

17   has officially refuted the tie-up between cigarette

18   smoking and cancer?

19        A.   It does say that.

20        Q.   And that was true, wasn't it?

21         A.   Well, officially, I'm not sure, but, I

22   mean, there were certainly people at the National

23   Cancer Institute who in that period of time wondered

24   whether cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer.

25        Q.   And I do believe that you testified in 4775

1   response to Mr. Scarola's inquiry yesterday that in

2    1953, there was a controversy about whether

3   cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

4        A.   I did say that.

5        Q.   And that was true, even though the

6   researchers and the scientists who were paying

7   attention to what had been reported in the published

8   scientific literature knew, number one, that male

9   heavy smokers had a higher preponderance of lung

10   cancer than males who did not smoke, right?

11         A.   In 1953,1 would say that's true.

12        Q.   And that was true in 1953, even though

13   they knew it was likely that cigarette smoke would

14   contain carcinogens such as poly cyclic aromatic

15   hydrocarbons?

16        A.   That's true.

17        Q.   And that was true even though in 1953 the

18   Wynder/Graham/Croninger mouse skin-painting test was

19   done that developed tumors on the backs of mice who

20   were coated with cigarette smoke condensation, true?

21         A.   The Wynder experiments have been published

22   in Cancer Research in '53, and that was a follow-up

23   to about 40 other published papers with animal mouse

24   painting. I think there was actually a review of

25   that in an R.J. Reynolds report, Survey of Cancer by 4776

1   Dr. Teague in 1953.

2        Q.   And I think actually you testified

3   yesterday that the prior mouse skin-painting

4   studies, or not necessarily mice, but prior

5   skin-painting studies with animals had had mixed

6   results, I believe you mentioned that yesterday,

7   right?

8        A.   That's true.

9        Q.   In fact, the Frank Statement itself

10   mentioned the 1953, or referred to the 1953 mouse

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=395
11    skin-painting studies by Drs. Wynder and Graham,

12   didn't it?

13        A.   It didn't specifically mention Wynder and

14   Graham, but it did reference the study, and I think

15   they were talking about the Wynder and Graham study.

16        Q.   In the context, as you put it I think

17   yesterday of had been transpiring at the time, it

18   was pretty clear that's what they meant?

19        A.   Sure.

20        Q.   And as I recall, and we can get it out if

21    you like, but it said that recent experiments with

22   mice have given wide publicity to a theory that

23   cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung

24   cancer in humans, right?

25        A.   That's right. 4777

1         Q.   And you would agree that that was just

2   theory at that point, wouldn't you?

3        A.   Well, there was accumulating evidence, and

4   certainly it was a theory, and then they stated what

5   the industry's positions were, and those were the

6   three positions that I showed in my testimony.

7        Q.   Was it a theory in 1953 or not?

8        A.   Sure, it was a theory, and evidence was

9   building in support of that theory.

10        Q.   And the Frank Statement acknowledged that

11    those studies with mice were done by doctors of

12   professional standing?

13        A.   Yes, they did.

14        Q.   Okay. But did say that those experiments

15   were not regarded as conclusive?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   And that was a correct statement, those

18   studies were not conclusive, were they?

19        A.   Yeah, I think that's a correct statement.

20   They pledged to support research into the

21    allegations of smoking and disease and said they

22   would put the public's health above all other

23   consideration, and that they would share whatever

24   they found with the public and medical

25   professionals, and work with medical professionals. 4778

1         Q.   We're going to get there.

2             The Frank Statement said they thought it

3   was in the public interest to call attention to the

4   fact that eminent doctors and research scientists

5   publicly requested the significance of those

6   experiments, right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   And that's also a true statement, is it

9   not?

10        A.   Yes.

11         Q.   Now, you mentioned yesterday Plaintiffs

12   Exhibit 2900, which I think you described as a white

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=396
13   paper published by the Tobacco Industry Research

14   Committee after its founding in approximately June

15   of 1954, entitled "The Scientific Perspective of the

16   Cigarette Controversy." Remember talking about

17   that?

18        A.   April it came out, yes.

19        Q.   April. April or June? I'll take April.

20        A.   I have it right here.

21         Q.   You have no evidence that Mr. Piendle ever

22   saw or heard of that publication, do you?

23        A.   No.

24        Q.   The balance of the paper is a series of

25   excerpts from the existing scientific literature and 4779

1    statements, including peer-reviewed literature that

2   had been published, right?

3        A.   That's true.

4        Q.   It was a compilation of other people's

5   work?

6        A.   It was.

7        Q.   Okay. And you know from your review of

8   this document that at least some of the scientific

9   publications that are referenced and quoted were

10   peer-reviewed, right?

11         A.   That's true.

12        Q.   The scientists whose statements were

13   referenced and included in this particular

14   publication, they were -- they included

15   well-respected scientists at the time, right?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   And if we could pull up PT2009,1 want to

18   read a part of what that white paper said.

19             And this is from, I think, page 4. You

20   found it?

21              And there was an express acknowledgment in

22   this white paper that "The Tobacco Industry Research

23   Committee does not suggest that these views

24   represent the entire body of scientific opinion on

25   the subject. Researchers the world over are 4780

1    studying dozens of theories in an attempt to solve

2   the mystery of cancer. At latest count, there are

3   more than 850 cancer research grants active in the

4   United States alone, any one of which might produce

5   evidence to unlock the secrets of lung cancer."

6             Isn't that right?

7        A.   That's true.

8        Q.   This white paper did not represent itself

9   to be anything other than a selection of what was in

10   the scientific literature at the time, did it?

11         A.   It's a selection of all the people who

12   doubted the theory, and I found it odd because it

13   was very inconsistent with the internal report that

14   was done by scientists at R.J. Reynolds that would

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=397
15   serve as the literature.

16        Q.   You have -- you've seen a March 5th, 1954

17   Hill & Knowlton memo from a B.R. Litton (phonetic)

18   to John Hill, haven't you?

19        A.   Which?

20        Q.   It's not one of the exhibits you talked to

21    the jury about.

22        A.   March?

23        Q.   March 5th, 1954.

24        A.   I don't recall that one offhand.

25        Q.   Do you recall about two months after the 4781

1   Frank Statement was written that a fellow named

2   Henry Legler, who was I guess vice president of

3   Lazarus Brothers Cigar Company, talked about a

4   survey that had been done to attempt to gauge the

5   effect of the Frank Statement on the American

6   public?

7        A.   I'm not familiar with the memo.

8        Q.   Not familiar with the memo. Do you recall

9   testifying about it previously at trial?

10        A.   I think I've been asked before at trial

11    about a poll that's been done, but I'm not familiar

12   with that memo.

13        Q.   You have been shown the memo before, have

14   you not?

15        A.   I don't recall it offhand, I may have.

16        Q.   Let me show it to you and see if you

17   remember.

18             If I could have, Liza, AN, A as in apple,

19   Nancy, 2743.

20             Let me just ask you to look at it, tell me

21    if you're familiar with it.

22             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach, Judge?

23             THE COURT: Yes.

24             MR. BIERSTEKER: Thank you. 25

4782

1     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

2        Q.   Do you remember seeing this before?

3        A.   Offhand, I would say no, I don't recall

4   it. I may have seen it. I just -- it's not ringing

5   a bell. I have a collection of a lot of the

6   Hill & Knowlton papers, but this one -- and there

7   are a lot, but I don't remember this one offhand.

8        Q.   Well, let me just ask the question. Do

9   you know whether or not polling data at the time

10   indicated that the Frank Statement had scared people

11    into coming down and in some cases stopping their

12   tobacco use entirely?

13        A.   I know there was a poll that was done, and

14   there was some discussion that the Frank Statement

15   had actually had an opposite effect to what the

16   manufacturers were concerned about, which is that

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=398
17   people would stop smoking.

18        Q.   You talked about the grant and aid program

19   that was conducted under the auspices of TIRC, and

20   then subsequently CTR, as being a public relations

21    gesture, you remember that yesterday?

22        A.   Actually, I read that from the internal

23   business records.

24        Q.   You did indeed, and you talked about it,

25   right? 4783

1        A.   That's right. There were several

2   statements to that effect.

3        Q.   I just want to ask you a little bit about

4   that. A portion of the Frank Statement that you

5   didn't read to the jury was a statement by the

6   tobacco companies at the time that they would

7   appoint a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and

8   national repute to head up research activities that

9   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was going to

10   undertake. You remember that from the Frank

11    Statement?

12        A.   I remember it from the Frank Statement,

13   and I remember testifying to this jury that they

14   created the TIRC that was set up to fund research,

15   and I think I talked about Clarence Cook Little, who

16   was the first scientific -- the chair of their

17   Scientific Advisory Board.

18        Q.   And I think you mentioned that he was at

19   one time the president of your alma mater, the

20   University of Michigan, right?

21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   I don't think that you mentioned he was on

23   the Advisory Board of the National Cancer Institute.

24        A.   No, I don't think I did. I think I

25   mentioned his current position at the time that he 4784

1   was serving on the Scientific Advisory Board, which

2   was the director of Jackson Labs.

3        Q.   You did mention that, but didn't he also

4   serve on the Advisory Board to the National Cancer

5   Institute?

6        A.   Yes. He held a number of positions.

7        Q.   He was a member of the National Academy of

8   Science, right?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   He was one of the most prominent

11    scientists in the country at the time?

12        A.   Yes, I would agree with that.

13        Q.   Now, the Frank Statement said that a group

14   of distinguished men and women, maybe men only in

15    1953 or '54, I'm not sure, but that a distinguished

16   group of scientists would serve on the Scientific

17   Advisory Board, right?

18        A.   That's true.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=399
19        Q.   And the scientists on the Scientific

20   Advisory Board would receive proposals for research

21    that would be funded by the TIRC, right?

22        A.   Well, they would review those proposals.

23        Q.   The proposals would come in and they would

24   review them?

25        A.   That's correct. 4785

1         Q.   And they would review them for what they

2   thought was their scientific merit?

3        A.   Correct.

4        Q.   And then they would make decisions about

5   which of these grant applications they would

6   actually fund?

7        A.   Well, they made decisions recommending

8   them for funding. All funding decisions were made

9   by the -- what they refer to as the lawyer committee

10   or committee on counsel which set the policy for

11    that organization.

12        Q.   Are you confident that that is true of the

13   grant and aid program as opposed to special

14   projects?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   Okay. Now, would you agree with me that

17   the members of the Scientific Advisory Board were,

18   in fact, reputable scientists?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   They were experts in a variety of

21    disciplines, weren't they?

22        A.   They were.

23        Q.   If we can take a look, I just want to put

24   up some of the names and affiliations of some of the

25   members, a demonstrative, defense demonstrative 46 4786

1    and 47.

2             Do you recognize these individuals as

3   having served on the Scientific Advisory Board of

4   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

5        A.   I do.

6        Q.   Okay. And we've got representatives here

7   from the National Cancer Institute and some of the

8   prominent universities in this country, right?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   I think there's another slide.

11              And these are also former advisers that

12   served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the

13   Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?

14        A.   Correct.

15        Q.   The TIRC/CTR grant and aid program has

16   funded top scientists from around the country,

17   hasn't it?

18        A.   They have.

19        Q.   Including some that were at Roswell Park

20   from the 1950s all the way through 1992, right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimo^pgNbr=400
21         A.   That's right.

22        Q.   And would you agree with me that a number

23   of the scientists who received funding from the

24   Tobacco Industry Research Committee received Nobel

25   Prizes in physiology and medicine? 4787

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   That the CTR grantees generated thousands

3   of articles that appeared in the peer-reviewed

4   scientific literature, including the Journal of the

5   American Medical Association?

6        A.   That's true.

7        Q.   Would you agree that about 600 to 700 of

8   the articles that were published in the literature

9   and that had been financed through -- you can take

10   that down -- through the Tobacco Industry Research

11    Committee ended up getting cited by the United

12   States Surgeon General in the Surgeon General's

13   reports?

14        A.   Yes. There were -- 600 to 700 or so have

15   been cited out of the 80,000 or so papers that are

16   referenced in the Surgeon General's reports.

17        Q.   Okay. Do you know whether one of those

18   publications was what you have referred to as the

19   Green Monster?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   And I think the jury has already heard

22   about that, but that was a -- a research tool that

23   was used by the Surgeon General's advisory committee

24   in 1964 in writing the 1964 Surgeon General's

25   report, wasn't it? 4788

1        A.   They acknowledge that review in their

2   introduction to that report in 1964.

3        Q.   Okay. In addition, do you know whether or

4   not articles that were published by the

5   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company scientists were also

6   cited in various Surgeon General's reports?

7        A.   I wouldn't dispute that they wouldn't be.

8   Surgeon General's reports look at the entire body of

9   evidence that exists in the published literature and

10   they report them, to try to get a weight of evidence

11    analysis of what the science shows.

12        Q.   Okay. Would you agree that the tobacco

13   industry, including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds,

14   cooperated with the National Cancer Institute in the

15   less hazardous cigarette program that began, I

16   think, in the late 1960s, I want to say 1968 through

17   about 1976 or '78, somewhere in that range there?

18        A.   Well, there was the Tobacco Working Group

19   that was formed and run by the National Cancer

20   Institute. The question of cooperation, there were

21    members from the companies, but my study shows that

22   the participants had to sign agreements that they

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=401
23   spoke on their behalf and not on behalf of the

24   companies when they attended those meetings.

25        Q.   Okay. When you're here today, you're 4789

1   testifying as Dr. Cummings, right?

2        A.   That's true.

3        Q.   You're not testifying on behalf of Roswell

4   Park, are you?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

7             Do you know whether or not R.J. Reynolds

8   Tobacco Company scientists participated with the

9   National Cancer Institute in the proceedings that

10   gave rise to National Cancer Institute Monograph

11    No. 7?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   Okay. And that was a monograph that dealt

14   with reduced tar and nicotine?

15        A.   It had to do with the FTC smoking machine.

16        Q.   Right. Which is -- which concern levels

17   of tar and nicotine in cigarette products, right?

18        A.   It had to do with the testing methodology

19   and whether it had anything do with what smokers

20   actually got exposed to.

21         Q.   Let's talk about some examples of

22   cooperation that the tobacco industry, or my client,

23   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, did or did not get

24   from the public health review.

25             You know that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco 4790

1    Company spent a great deal of time and resources

2   developing a product -- actually several products,

3   but a product that heated but did not burn tobacco

4   called Premier in the 1980s, true?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   And the Reynolds development and testing

7   efforts for Premier were documented in a 700-page

8   approximately monograph, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   Publicly available?

11         A.   Well, I have a copy of it, so . . .

12        Q.   Okay. And the monograph cites to several

13   studies that were done by the company in order to

14   assess the advantages of this particular approach to

15   cigarette design, right?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   And there were a number of studies that

18   were cited in the monograph that came from the

19   peer-reviewed literature as well?

20        A.   There were.

21         Q.   Okay. At the time, wasn't it true that

22   there were scientists who believed that

23   tobacco-heating products were safer than

24   tobacco-burning cigarettes?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=402
25        A.   Yes. 4791

1         Q.   Okay. And, in fact, that was addressed

2   in, among other places, an editorial in the British

3   cancer journal, Lancet, wasn't it?

4        A.   It may have been. I mean, there have been

5   a lot of statements written about, you know, the

6   different cigarette designs, like the products that

7   heat rather than burn tobacco, they're not really

8   cigarettes, they're more like nicotine nebulizers.

9        Q.   Okay. You don't want to call it a

10   cigarette?

11         A.   No. Because a cigarette, by definition in

12   the government, is a roll of tobacco in a piece of

13   paper that's meant for burning and inhalation, and

14   the Premier product, actually, while it had tobacco,

15   no tobacco was burned.

16        Q.   It was tobacco rolled in paper, though,

17   right?

18        A.   It was actually tobacco rolled around a

19   metal container that had glycerin and nicotine-laced

20   beads that were heated with a carbon tip.

21         Q.   In your view, at the time, Premier was a

22   safer product than conventional tobacco-burning

23   cigarettes, wasn't it?

24        A.   Yes, that would still be my view today.

25        Q.   Okay. And you think that if smokers 4792

1    switched to Premier instead of tobacco-burning

2   cigarettes, it would have been significantly reduced

3   diseased burdens, right?

4        A.   Actually, I believe if R.J. Reynolds had

5   chosen only to sell Premier, there would be

6   significantly reduced health burdens.

7        Q.   Okay. You would agree that Premier was

8   responsive to the concerns that the public health

9   community had about cigarette smoking and health?

10        A.   They were responsive in the sense that

11    they were looking at an alternative way to deliver

12   nicotine, so very disappointed that they kept

13   selling combustion tobacco products and not Premier.

14        Q.   Well, Premier wasn't very successful, was

15   it?

16        A.   I'm not sure what you mean.

17        Q.   Well, was it successful in the consumer

18   test markets?

19        A.   It was tried in two test markets, I

20   believe, in St. Louis and in Tucson, Arizona, and

21    then it was withdrawn.

22        Q.   Do you know whether or not smokers

23   rejected the product in the test markets?

24        A.   I don't know why it was withdrawn.

25        Q.   Okay. You do know that Premier 4793

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=403
1    encountered strong opposition by major public health

2   and medical groups in this country, don't you?

3        A.   I think there was some concern about

4   introducing a nicotine delivery device that was not

5   regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

6        Q.   In fact, isn't it true that the Surgeon

7   General of the United States, Dr. Koop, opposed the

8   introduction of Premier?

9        A.   For that reason.

10        Q.   Okay. And isn't it true that the FDA was

11    suggesting it was going to regulate it and make it

12   available only by prescription?

13        A.   Well, the FDA really didn't know what to

14   do with the product, and there was some discussion

15   about what to do with Premier, because it had just

16   been launched into a test market without going to

17   the FDA in advance. Most drug products have to go

18   through review before they're just put into the

19   market.

20        Q.   Despite those setbacks, Reynolds went back

21    to the drawing board, didn't they?

22        A.   In what regards? They went back and

23   continued to sell their combustion tobacco products.

24        Q.   No, went back to the drawing board and

25   developed another tobacco-heating cigarette called 4794

1   Eclipse.

2        A.   They did develop a new product called

3   Eclipse that was introduced, I think, in 1997, '96,

4   something like that.

5        Q.   You believe that Eclipse is the safest

6   tobacco-heating product around?

7        A.   No, I wouldn't say that today.

8        Q.   Okay. Was it the safest one at the time

9   that was commercially available?

10        A.   When?

11         Q.   In the mid-1990s when it was introduced.

12        A.   It's available today, it's not the safest

13   one today.

14        Q.   Not the safest one today, but it's still

15   available today, right?

16        A.   It is still available today. It's been

17   changed, modified.

18        Q.   Isn't it true that you suggested that

19   Eclipse might be an alternative for smokers who

20   would never get around to quitting?

21         A.   It could be.

22        Q.   Now, beginning in about April of 1996, you

23   attended a series of meetings that Reynolds held for

24   scientists in the public health community, among

25   others, to discuss the design and marketing of 4795

1   Eclipse, right?

2        A.   I attended a meeting that I was invited to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=404
3   attend with three other scientists, and this was

4   arranged with Don DeBethizy at RJ. Reynolds, and it

5   is because I had written an article on different

6   patents related to these heating tobacco products.

7        Q.   Okay. And you had -- in fact, it was not

8   just one meeting, but there were several over

9   approximately an 18-month period, right?

10        A.   Well, I attended one meeting in Winston,

11    Salem and I attended other meetings in my role as a

12   scientific adviser to the Department of Health in

13   Massachusetts that was undertaking an effort to

14   regulate tobacco products and their representatives

15   from Reynolds and Philip Morris and other companies

16   attended.

17        Q.   Is that an instance in cooperation with

18   public health authorities?

19        A.   Well, they weren't very cooperative, in my

20   opinion. In fact, I offered to do a study for

21    Reynolds to evaluate Eclipse and the health

22   consequences and what the behavioral impact would be

23   and I never received back a response to that offer.

24        Q.   Isn't it true that about the same time you

25   started talking to Reynolds, you got retained by 4796

1   plaintiffs counsel in connection with litigation

2   against R.J. Reynolds?

3        A.   I was retained by the state attorney

4   general's office in some of the -- what they refer

5   to as the Medicaid cases after that meeting at

6   Reynolds.

7        Q.   Okay.

8        A.   But shortly after.

9        Q.   And isn't it true that you concealed and

10   never mentioned that fact to Reynolds over the

11    entire 18-month time that you were meeting with

12   them?

13        A.   It was never concealed at all. It never

14   came up in discussion with scientists that I dealt

15   with, but I assume that they knew, since my name was

16   mentioned and I was being deposed by their

17   attorneys. So certainly not concealed at all from

18   the companies.

19        Q.   Are you confident that your retention by

20   the state's attorneys general was, in fact,

21    disclosed during that period?

22        A.   I don't know. I was --1 know I was

23   deposed in cases beginning around 1996, '97, in that

24   period.

25        Q.   Let's talk about advertising, one of the 4797

1    other topics you talked about over the course of

2   your direct examination with Mr. Scarola. You have

3   not been a full-time employee of a private business,

4   have you?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=405
5        A.   No. I mean, Roswell Park is quasi public,

6   so we have a private sector, but we do get public

7   sector funding.

8        Q.   You have never been responsible for

9   developing or implementing any marketing plans or

10   advertising plans for private businesses that sell

11    consumer products; is that true?

12        A.   That's true.

13        Q.   It's also true, isn't it, that the only

14   area of advertising and marketing that you have

15   studied extensively is advertising and marketing for

16   cigarettes?

17        A.   No, that's not true at all. I basically

18   studied in the area of health communication and have

19   planned and executed mass media campaigns, not only

20   in the area of tobacco control, but also in other

21    areas of cancer prevention, primarily related to

22   early detection of cancer, particularly colorectal

23   cancer and screening for colorectal cancer.

24        Q.   For what other consumer product have you

25   extensively studied the advertising and marketing? 4798

1        A.   Well, the consumer product that we were

2   marketing there was the hemoccult test.

3        Q.   Now, you would agree with me, would you

4   not, that youth engage in many risky behaviors?

5        A.   Yes, they do.

6        Q.   For example, some teenagers use steroids,

7   right?

8        A.   That's right.

9        Q.   Some teens use marijuana?

10        A.   They do.

11         Q.   Some teens carry guns?

12        A.   Yes, they do.

13        Q.   Some teens have unprotected sex?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And many of the risky behaviors in which

16   teens engage aren't advertised at all, are they?

17        A.   Now, with the Internet, it's hard to know

18   what's being advertised or not, but those are not

19   commercially advertised.

20        Q.   Commercially advertised, okay. You

21    talked, I think it was yesterday, maybe the day

22   before, but about factors that can influence young

23   people to start smoking. Do you remember that?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   And wouldn't you agree that smoking by 4799

1   parents is a factor that makes it more likely that

2   teens in the household will start smoking?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Would you agree that smoking by a teen's

5   friends make it more likely that a teen will start

6   smoking?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=406
7        A.   Yes, social influences.

8        Q.   Social influences. Would you agree that

9   smoking by a teen's siblings has been shown to make

10   it more likely that the teen will smoke?

11         A.   Yes.

12        Q.   Okay. And you're familiar with reports

13   that talk about some of those kinds of findings,

14   aren't you?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   Would you agree that while there are many

17   factors that can influence a teen's decision to take

18   up smoking, the one with the most influence is the

19   smoking behavior of the people around him or her?

20        A.   I -- you know, the strongest predictor,

21    and it depends on what age you're looking at,

22   preteens versus teenage years, so the age -- the

23   predictors tend to shift with friends being more

24   important in later years and siblings and parents

25   being more important in the early years, because 4800

1   usually parents are the source of the cigarettes,

2   not handing them to them, but kids steal them from

3   mom and dad to experiment, and that's what my

4   familiarity is with literature, as well as my own

5   studies.

6        Q.   I think you -- well, let me just ask. You

7   testified that starting in the early 1970s, I think

8   it was 1971, that advertising for cigarettes had

9   been banned from radio and television, right?

10        A.   That's true.

11         Q.   Okay. And the 1979 Surgeon General's

12   report that you talked about on direct, I believe,

13   discussed advertising bans, didn't it?

14        A.   The'79 report?

15        Q.   Yeah.

16        A.   I'm not sure we talked about that report,

17   but it may have talked about the ad ban.

18        Q.   Let me just ask a couple of questions.

19   Isn't it true that there, historically, were

20   countries in which there was little or no

21    advertising of cigarettes, such as China before it's

22   economic opening or eastern European countries

23   before the Berlin wall fell?

24        A.   You said there was no advertising?

25        Q.   I said little or none. 4801

1        A.   No, I wouldn't agree with that.

2        Q.   You wouldn't agree with that?

3        A.   No.

4        Q.   Were there ads on TV and radio for

5   cigarettes in those countries at that time?

6        A.   Typically, they would get advertising for

7   cigarettes in those countries because they would be

8   getting the broadcast coming from other countries,

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=407
9   for example, in Europe, into eastern Europe and so

10   on.

11         Q.   So you're saying some advertising might

12   cross the Iron Curtain?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Pretty limited comparatively to the kind

15   of advertising that was prevalent in this country

16   and to which you testified occurred during the 1950s

17   and 1960s, right?

18        A.   Yes.

19        Q.   Okay. So comparatively, a significantly

20   lower amount of advertising and marketing in those

21    countries at that time?

22        A.   You know, probably, I would say that's

23   true, but there was certainly a fair amount of

24   advertising. The most important ad is somebody

25   using the brand, brands get their popularity, that's 4802

1   what we talked about --1 talked about in terms of

2   the bandwagon effect.

3        Q.   You think it's an ad if somebody else is

4   smoking and somebody observes it?

5        A.   I think the package is one of the most

6   important aspects of marketing a brand and there's a

7   fair amount of research that goes into product

8   packages because it is, in fact, an ad for the

9   product.

10        Q.   Let me just ask the question this way:

11    Isn't it true that in countries like China and the

12   former Soviet Union where there was comparatively

13   little in the way of advertising and marketing in

14   the media, that there were very high rates of

15   smoking and smoking initiation in the 1950s and

16   '60s?

17        A.   You know, I don't --1 haven't studied

18   China in the '50s and '60s. I have a study going on

19   in China, there's a massive amount of advertising

20   going on there now.

21         Q.   Now?

22        A.   Yeah, but it's China tobacco. It's not

23   the big tobacco companies, and they're a communist

24   country.

25        Q.   It's a state monopoly, right? 4803

1        A.   It is.

2        Q.   So you just don't know what the prevalence

3   of smoking or the rates of initiation of smoking

4   were in the former Soviet Union or China during the

5    1960s and '70s before those countries opened up?

6        A.   I don't know the answer to those questions

7   at the time periods you're asking about.

8        Q.   Well, you talked about deposition of

9   several fact witnesses earlier, and you read those

10   depositions, right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=408
11         A.   I did.

12        Q.   And you read the depositions because you

13   wanted to learn as much as you could about

14   Mr. Piendle to make --so that you can make informed

15   expert opinions to communicate to the jury in this

16   case, right?

17        A.   That's true.

18        Q.   And isn't it true that in all of the

19   depositions you read, you didn't see any evidence

20   that Mr. Piendle started to smoke because of an

21    advertisement?

22        A.   Nobody said that. What I focused on were

23   the brands that he was smoking.

24        Q.   Well, let's take a look at your

25   deposition, sir, in this case. If I could have the 4804

1    deposition dated April 3rd, 2010.

2             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach,

3        your Honor?

4             THE COURT: Yes.

5             MR. BIERSTEKER: Do you want a copy,

6        your Honor?

7             THE COURT: Yes, please.

8             THE WITNESS: Thank you.

9     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

10        Q.   And if you could turn to page 149.

11         A.   Okay.

12        Q.   Lines 5 through 8.

13        A.   Okay.

14        Q.   Do you recall being asked this question:

15              "Is there any basis in the record that

16   you've read to indicate that Mr. Piendle began

17   smoking because of an advertisement?"

18             Answer:  "No."

19        A.   That's what it says.

20        Q.   And I was correct, wasn't I?

21         A.   Well, as I indicated, the brands he

22   smoked -- the brands that he was smoking is an

23   indication of his response to advertising. He was

24   smoking the most heavily advertised brands at the

25   time, particularly for his age cohort. 4805

1         Q.   He was smoking popular brands, right?

2        A.   The most popular among teenage boys.

3        Q.   Okay. Are you aware -- let me phrase it

4   differently.

5             You are not aware of any evidence, are

6   you, in the records that you reviewed prior to your

7   deposition, that Mr. Piendle relied on tobacco

8   advertising in deciding to continue to smoke over

9   the years, true?

10        A.   In the narrow form of advertising, no.

11         Q.   You mentioned that the Piendles smoked a

12   number of different brands of cigarettes over the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=409
13   years; is that right?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   And you know from reading Mrs. Piendle's

16   deposition in this case that most of the time the

17   decision to switch concerned taste, right?

18        A.   Yes.

19        Q.   Isn't it true that aside from taste, you

20   have no evidence why the Piendles switched to any

21   particular brand of cigarettes?

22        A.   Other than the brand history, no.

23        Q.   Do you recall that Mr. Piendle even smoked

24   Virginia Slims, at least sporadically?

25        A.   Yes, there were a variety of other minor 4806

1   brands that I think were mentioned. The main ones

2   were Marlboro, Winston, Merit, Doral, and Raleigh,

3   for a brief period, and then there were some other

4   ones, Tareyton.

5        Q.   Very incidental?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   But one of those was Virginia Slims,

8   right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And you have reviewed hundreds, maybe

11    thousands of cigarette ads during the course of your

12   review of the materials that are housed at Roswell

13   Park?

14        A.   That's right. I have a collection of, you

15   know, about 10,000 different cigarette ads.

16        Q.   Have you ever seen a Virginia Slims

17   advertisement that was geared toward men?

18        A.   No. I mean, clearly, Virginia Slims is a

19   cigarette -- the theme of the advertising is clearly

20   aimed at women, but in my experience, men have

21    certainly tried Virginia Slims. I've even come

22   across males to smoke Virginia Slims, but bumming

23   cigarettes, people often end up getting a variety of

24   brands during their smoking history.

25        Q.   Isn't it true that there is no evidence in 4807

1   the record that you have reviewed that establishes

2   that Mr. Piendle sought any particular advertisement

3   for cigarettes, other than a Marlboro billboard?

4        A.   I believe that was the testimony that I

5   reviewed, although he had the packs and the pack is

6   part of the advertising.

7        Q.   Let me ask --

8        A.   Most people don't think of it that way,

9   but it's actually a very critical part of the

10   marketing for the product.

11         Q.   Isn't it true that you cannot identify any

12   specific cigarette ad, not including packages, that

13   Mr. Piendle saw, read, or heard?

14        A.   That's true.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%2pgNbr=410
15        Q.   Okay. And you certainly don't know

16   whether any specific advertisement that he may have

17   seen, read, or heard mattered to him, true?

18        A.   Well, the specific ads, no. But the

19   campaigns, which I shared with the jury yesterday,

20   certainly reflected the major campaign themes,

21    although the record, as I reviewed it and was asked,

22   did not give an indication of any specific ad that I

23   recall Mr. Piendle seeing, but that wouldn't mean he

24   didn't see advertising, it was virtually everywhere.

25   It was hard to escape seeing these major campaigns 4808

1   for Marlboro, Winston, Lucky Strikes, I believe

2   those were the ads that I shared with the jury.

3        Q.   How do you pronounce the plaintiffs last

4   name?

5        A.   Piendle.

6             THE COURT: Counsel wants to let me know

7        when it's a convenient breaking point?

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Give me just about two

9        minutes, Judge.

10             THE COURT: Sure.

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: And I'll take a break.

12     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

13        Q.   Let me just ask, it's certainly true that

14   Mr. Piendle didn't mention to Mrs. Piendle any

15   specific advertisement for any cigarette product;

16   isn't that true?

17        A.   That's true.

18        Q.   There's no evidence that Mr. Piendle

19   pointed out a specific advertisement to any

20   cigarette product to anybody, is there?

21         A.   That's true, from the record that I

22   reviewed.

23        Q.   You don't know what TV programs he

24   watched, do you?

25        A.   Not offhand. 4809

1         Q.   You don't know what magazines he read, do

2   you?

3        A.   No.

4        Q.   Do you know what newspapers he read?

5        A.   Not offhand.

6        Q.   Is it true that you don't have any

7   firsthand experience with any aspect of

8   Mr. Piendle's smoking?

9        A.   Firsthand experience, no. I've reviewed

10   the records and was asked to make an opinion about

11    his nicotine addiction and relationship between

12   nicotine addiction and his lung cancer.

13             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I think I'm

14        now at that break point.

15             THE COURT: Okay. If counsel could

16        approach, please.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=411
17             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

18        held out of the presence of the jury:)

19             THE COURT: How much longer do you think

20        you're going to be?

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: About a half an hour.

22             THE COURT: Okay. So if we come back at

23        3:15, that would be quarter of 4:00.

24             How long does Philip Morris think?

25             MR. KELLY: It's very hard for me to say, 4810

1        your Honor.

2             THE COURT: You think about an hour?

3             MR. KELLY: More than that. Is it ~

4             THE COURT: I want to let the jury know if

5        we're staying late. I think it's in

6        everybody's interest to let the witness finish

7        today. I think we may need to let them make

8        phone calls.

9             MR. KELLY: Is it possible for the witness

10        to come back on Monday?

11              MR. SCAROLA: It is possible for the

12        witness to come back on Monday. I will tell

13        you that I do have a concern about not having

14        adequate time for redirect. So rather than be

15        in a position where --

16             MR. KELLY: Redirect is at 7:00 o'clock.

17             MR. SCAROLA: -- redirect is late in the

18        evening, without the jury having had prior

19        warning that it was going to happen, as

20        difficult and inconvenient as it is, we would

21        prefer to bring the doctor back on Monday

22        morning.

23             THE COURT: The balance I'm trying to keep

24        is the interest of allowing you to complete

25        your testimony and examinations and finishing 4811

1        your trial so there is not a mistrial because

2        of inability of the Court to preside over a

3        trial that must end, must end by August 6th.

4             MR. SCAROLA: I believe we're going to get

5        to closing argument next week.

6             THE COURT: I know you believe that, but

7        it's my job to add that sort of layer of

8        protection. That's why I keep asking, and it's

9        in everyone's interest not to have the trial

10        mistried because of that reason, maybe there

11         are other reasons.

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: Maybe over a break, we

13        can see over the break.

14             THE COURT: I can mention to the jury we

15        can stay a little late, if phone calls need to

16        be made and see how it goes.

17             MR. KELLY: I've been trying to watch the

18        jury and this is slow-going, your Honor, and

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Qimmings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=412
19        Friday afternoon. If I have to get up at --

20        you know, go into 5:00 and 5:30.

21              THE COURT: I'm not going to prejudice

22        Philip Morris. I will weigh all of those

23        factors. I just want to confer with everyone

24        as we go along. I understand that.

25             MR. KELLY: Thank you. 4812

1              (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

3        held within the presence of the jury:)

4             THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

5        we're going to give you your midafternoon

6        break. All of us are most appreciative of how

7        patient and attentive you've been. We know

8        it's long days, and we really just want to

9        express our appreciation.

10             I say that as a preface to my next

11         question, which is, to the extent that we need

12        to go beyond 5:00, and this is all in the

13        interest of trying to move the case along so as

14        to conclude when we said we would conclude, but

15        weighing the importance of jurors being

16        attentive and not overstepping our boundaries,

17        I suppose, is there anyone who believes if you

18        had to stay a little bit over 5:00 today, it

19        could not be done because you have other plans,

20        and that's totally understandable, or B, that

21         would be pushing it just in terms of your

22        ability to remain attentive and patient? Don't

23        be shy.

24             MR. SALES: Do you have an opinion within

25        a reasonable degree of probability? 4813

1              THE COURT: If we said half-hour to an

2        hour, how does that sound?

3             JUROR TYSON: I could leave at 5:30,1

4        have to pick up my daughter.

5             THE COURT: Okay. So 5:30 is the limit.

6        Fair enough. So if we need to go to 5:30, does

7        anyone need to make a phone call to -- in light

8        of that, we won't go beyond 5:30. Okay. With

9        that, we'll be back at 3:15 with the same

10        important instruction, no discussing the case.

11              (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

12        after which the following proceedings were

13        held:)

14             THE COURT: I'll remind our witness not to

15        discuss your testimony with anyone over the

16        break.

17             Okay. So maybe if counsel could confer,

18        try to streamline, we'll go to 5:30. The goal

19        would be to try to finish with Dr. Cummings, if

20        we can.

21              MR. HENK: Can we do that offer of proof,

22        your Honor?

23             THE COURT: Not right now.

24             MR. HENK: I'm just asking.

25             THE COURT: We all can stay after 5:30 to 4814

1         do that, but the jury can't. So let's give

2        you-all your break.

3             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

4        2:59 p.m. until 3:14 p.m., after which the

5        following proceedings were held:)

6             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, we have had a

7        scheduling problem arise I want to call to the

8        Court's attention. The only way Dr. Cummings

9        can make it back home for the weekend

10        reasonably is to catch a 7:30 flight out of

11         Fort Lauderdale. And if we go to 5:30 on a

12        Friday afternoon when it's raining, that

13        virtually makes it impossible for him. So we

14        would request that we not go past 5:00 in order

15        to get him home on his plane.

16             THE COURT: He was going to go home this

17        weekend regardless?

18             MR. SCAROLA: Since we got to bring him

19        back anyway for the half hour, I would like to

20        be able to --

21              THE COURT: No, I don't want to hold him

22        up for sure.

23             We can bring everyone in.

24             THE WITNESS: Monday is a problem for me.

25        So if you need to finish me, do it today, 4815

1         and --

2             THE COURT: Don't look at me.

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: That's fine.

4             THE WITNESS: I would prefer to do it

5        today, and if I have to find my way around to

6        get home sometime tomorrow or over the weekend,

7        because my week next week is full.

8             THE COURT: Maybe why don't we -- so maybe

9        if it really can be done by 5:30, it sounds

10        like that's preferable, if it really can be

11         done.

12             MR. SCAROLA: We'll make every effort.

13             (Thereupon, the jury entered the

14        courtroom, after which the following

15        proceedings were held:)

16             THE COURT: Okay. Welcome back. You may

17        be seated.

18             And you may continue.

19     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

20        Q.   You showed the jury a number of cigarette

21    ads from the 1950s and even earlier, right, during

22   the course of your direct examination?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=414
23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   And you mentioned certain themes that

25   appeared in those ads that were military themes, for 4816

1    example, holiday themes, and endorsements by

2   celebrities, either athletes or movie stares,

3   whatever?

4        A.   That's right.

5        Q.   And those were popular ad themes in

6   general, were they not, at the time?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Celebrity endorsements, for example, are

9   used even in ads today for products like Nike?

10        A.   Yes, I believe I mentioned that.

11         Q.   And Dan Marino does something for

12   Nutrisystem, right?

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   And that was also true in the 1950s, not

15   just for cigarette products, but for a number of

16   others, right?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   Would you agree with me that none of the

19   themes that you portrayed in the advertising, the

20   athletes, the military themes, the movie stars, the

21    holiday themes, were unique to cigarette products in

22   the 1950s and earlier?

23        A.   They weren't unique just to cigarette

24   products, I would agree with that.

25        Q.   And I think you were asked whether or not 4817

1   there was a shift in cigarette advertising in the

2    1960s, and you suggested that there really wasn't.

3        A.   No. I said that generally the themes were

4   the same, but there certainly was a lot more

5   promotion for filtered cigarettes.

6        Q.   Okay. Let me just ask you, isn't it true

7   that 45 years ago, 46 years ago, in 1964, the

8   tobacco industry adopted an advertising code?

9        A.   The volunteer advertising code, I'm

10   familiar with it.

11         Q.   And as a consequence of that advertising

12   code in 1964, there were no longer testimonials in

13   cigarette ads from athletes, true?

14        A.   Not testimonials, but they continued to

15   use athletes, which were a violation. I think we

16   showed a 1966 ad with the Green Bay Packers as just

17   one example.

18        Q.   Oh, for the sponsorship of the NFL

19   program, the NFL playoff, right?

20        A.   Right. And then I mentioned NASCAR

21    racing, Marlboro racing, Virginia Slims tennis. I

22   mean, there's quite a large number.

23        Q.   But no individual athlete was standing up

24   saying, "I smoke Camel" or whatever other brand, and

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=415
25   you should try it too, right? 4818

1        A.   That's true.

2        Q.   And there were no more celebrities in

3   cigarette advertising after the adoption of the

4   Cigarette Advertising Code in 1964?

5        A.   No, that's not true.

6        Q.   No more testimonials?

7        A.   There were testimonials by people who were

8   in various -- particularly in the musical industry,

9   who talked about and were used to advertise tobacco

10   products, different brands.

11         Q.   Now, you mentioned in your direct

12   examination that during the 1950s, there were

13   advertisements that featured doctors that you talked

14   about, or a doctor who smoked Camel.

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   And other ads that referred to reduced

17   tar, right, filters?

18        A.   Well, filters, yes.

19        Q.   Filters; is that right?

20        A.   That's true.

21         Q.   Isn't it true that the Surgeon General

22   concluded that those old advertisements actually

23   backfired and simply reminded smokers about the

24   health risks of smoking?

25        A.   Well, that -- there was speculation that 4819

1   it had that effect because when filters were first

2   introduced on Viceroy and Kent, cigarette sales

3   declined, which was one of the reasons that the

4   executives got together at the Plaza Hotel, because

5   their cigarette sales had declined for the first

6   time since the Great Depression. And they talked

7   about advertising of their products.

8        Q.   Isn't it true that in the 1994 Surgeon

9   General's report, that's the one that dealt with,

10   among other things, advertising, right?

11         A.   That report really did not -- it may have

12   commented on advertising in passing, but it was on

13   the health effects of smoking.

14        Q.   Isn't it true that that report describes

15   cigarette advertising on health claims and

16   reassurances from the 1950s, including not a cough

17   in a carload, no throat irritation, more doctors

18   smoke Camels, and other ads, and concludes that

19   those ads increased consumer awareness about the

20   health risks of smoking?

21         A.   I'm not sure if that's the conclusion.

22   There's a reference to those ads and a discussion of

23   the marketing of filtered cigarettes in the

24   '64 report. I don't think that's a conclusion of

25   that report, however. 4820

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=416
1         Q.   You said '64. You meant '94, didn't you?

2        A.   I thought you said '64.

3        Q.   No,'94.

4        A.   The '94 report is on marketing to kids.

5        Q.   Right. Exactly. That's my point. And in

6   that Surgeon General's report, didn't it conclude

7   that the ads in the 1950s about filters and about

8   more doctors smoke Camels and not any irritation,

9   only served to increase consumer awareness on the

10   health risks of smoking?

11         A.I don't think that was a conclusion of

12   that report.

13        Q.   All right. Well, let me see if I can

14   refresh your memory by looking at AS39, the 1994

15   Surgeon General's report.

16             This was one of the reports you reviewed,

17   is it not, Doctor?

18        A.   No, I was a contributor to this report.

19        Q.   You contributed to this report.

20             MR. BIERSTEKER: May I approach, Judge?

21              THE COURT: Yes.

22     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

23        Q.   I've just got the one page I'm interested

24   in here.

25        A.   Okay. 4821

1         Q.   And if you look at page 171. We can

2   actually pull it up and just maybe the whole -- we

3   can do the whole first paragraph to where the

4   highlighting ends.

5             They talk about a number of ads including

6   those that you spoke to the jury about, such as no

7   throat irritation, more doctors smoke Camels, and so

8   forth, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   And you commented, "With greater public

11    concern about cancer, however, these continuing

12   health claims, although intended to reassure

13   consumers, were likely increasing consumer awareness

14   of the suspected health risks of smoking."

15             My question is: Doctor, do you disagree?

16        A.   I disagree that that is a conclusion of

17   the report. These reports have conclusions at the

18   end of every chapter. What you had asked before was

19   not a conclusion.

20        Q.   Do you agree -- I'm sorry, are you

21    finished?

22        A.   I'm finished.

23        Q.   Whether we characterize it as a conclusion

24   or a statement, do you agree or disagree with it?

25        A.   I agree that it says what it says, but 4822

1    conclusions are based on weight of evidence, and

2   that carries a weight that's different than just a

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=417
3   comment of somebody's opinion that gets reported.

4   So it's not a conclusion.

5        Q.   Okay. But my question, respectfully, was

6   not whether it was a conclusion or a statement or

7   whatever else you want to call it. My question was:

8   Do you agree or disagree with this sentence?

9        A.   I agree that that's what the sentence

10   says.

11         Q.   Do you agree or disagree with the

12   substance of the sentence?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Well, that's respectfully not an answer.

15   Do you agree or disagree?

16        A.   I disagree.

17        Q.   Thank you.

18             Take it down.

19             You also showed the ladies and gentlemen

20   of the jury--

21         A.   And I can explain why if you'd like to

22   know why.

23        Q.   No, I really don't.

24             You also showed the ladies and gentlemen

25   of the jury cigarette ads that ran before 4823

1   Mr. Piendle was born, right?

2        A.   That's right.

3        Q.   And you showed ads for cigarettes that he

4   never smoked.

5        A.   That's right. It was intended to try to

6   give the jury a sense of the environment, the

7   information environment as it existed before and

8   during the time that he was smoking, particularly at

9   the time he took up smoking.

10        Q.   All right. Well, let's take a look at

11    some of the ads that ran for brands of cigarettes

12   that Mrs. Piendle indicated Mr. Piendle smoked, and

13   we'll look at some examples of ads that ran during

14   the time he was smoking those brands.

15             And if I could have ATS7117. Apple, Tom,

16   Sam.

17             This was an ad -- let me just back up a

18   minute. You remember that Mrs. Piendle said

19   Mr. Piendle smoked Raleigh for a period of time

20   starting in mid-1970s ?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   This is an ad for Raleigh that I think ran

23   in 1976, right?

24        A.   That's right.

25        Q.   What is this ad in particular? 4824

1        A.   It's an ad for Raleigh cigarettes touting

2   its good taste, good times.

3        Q.   There's a guy fishing, right?

4        A.   Yes.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=418
5        Q.   There's a briefcase down here, right?

6   That's one of the things you could maybe get with

7   one of those coupons?

8        A.   That's right. Raleigh was well-known for

9   the coupons.

10        Q.   Is this an ad you think youth would find

11    attractive?

12        A.   No, Raleigh was not a product for youth.

13        Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at another

14   Raleigh ad, also from 1976, ATS7118.

15             Anything attractive to youth in this ad,

16   Doctor?

17        A.   The dog, maybe. No. I mean, Raleigh was

18   a brand that was not -- did not become a first usual

19   brand choice for young adults.

20        Q.   All right. Let's talk about Winston

21    cigarettes. Mr. Piendle smoked Winston cigarettes

22   when?

23        A.   1950s, 1960s, and into the early '70s.

24        Q.   Didn't he really start smoking Winstons

25   after he met Mrs. Piendle in 1969 or so? 4825

1        A.   He was smoking Winstons at that time, yes.

2        Q.   Let's take a look at ATS7115.

3             Okay. I will represent to you that this

4   is a Winston ad I think from around 1975, although

5   the copy I have is not one that actually ran because

6   it doesn't have the warning on it. But let me --1

7   can only get what I can get.

8             What does this ad depict?

9        A.   It looks like an ad for Winston

10   cigarettes, using their "Winston tastes good like a

11    cigarette should" theme, which is a consistent theme

12   used over decades.

13        Q.   And is this individual engaging in any

14   sort of activity that would appeal to kids?

15        A.   No, it looks rather sinister. Maybe

16   that's why the ad never ran.

17        Q.   Does this ad strike you, as an expert in

18   the field, as having particular appeal to

19   individuals under the age of 18?

20             MR. SCAROLA: Or anyone.

21              MR. BIERSTEKER: You're right. I'm sorry,

22        I stand corrected.

23        A.   I don't know.

24     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

25        Q.   Let's take a look at a 1955 Lucky Strike 4826

1    ad, ATS7116. What is that ad depicting?

2        A.   It's an ad for Lucky Strikes and talking,

3   again, about good taste and a glamorous woman

4   smoking it.

5        Q.   Okay. Is this woman engaging in any sort

6   of activity that you think kids would find

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=419
7   attractive?

8        A.   Smoking.

9        Q.   Smoking, okay. Does this ad strike you as

10   one that would have particular appeal to individuals

11    under the age of 18?

12        A.   Not offhand, that particular ad.

13        Q.   Do you know if this ad would have appeal

14   to individuals under the age of 16?

15        A.   I don't. I don't think -- I'm not

16   familiar with that ad being tested with people under

17    16.

18        Q.   Do you know what the legal age for smoking

19   was in Connecticut at the time Mr. Piendle lived

20   there?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   What was it?

23        A.   It was 16.

24        Q.   Thank you. Now, attractive people in ads

25   would appeal to adults too? 4827

1        A.   Oh, yeah. I mean, ads for different

2   segments of the market.

3        Q.   People over the age of 18 are interested

4   in seeing ads for adult products that have

5   attractive members of the opposite sex in them?

6        A.   Sure.

7        Q.   Now, you noted in the first day of your

8   direct examination with Mr. Scarola that you've

9   never seen a tobacco ad showing people with lung

10   cancer and other terrible diseases caused by

11    smoking, you remember that?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   Let me ask you a couple of questions about

14   that. Have you ever seen an alcohol ad that shows

15   an alcoholic suffering from delirium tremors?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   Have you ever seen an alcohol ad showing a

18   drunk driver getting into an accident?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Have you ever seen an alcohol ad showing a

21    man or a woman with a hangover?

22        A.   No, I don't.

23        Q.   Have you ever seen a motorcycle ad that

24   shows somebody who was crippled or killed because of

25   an accident with a motorcycle? 4828

1        A.   No.

2        Q.   Have you ever seen an ad for a fast food

3   company that shows somebody having a heart attack or

4   recovering from having a heart attack?

5        A.   No.

6        Q.   Have you ever seen a McDonald's ad showing

7   morbidly obese people?

8        A.   No, not that I recall. They may have

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=420
9   obese people in some of their advertising, I don't

10   recall it offhand.

11         Q.   Do you recall seeing McDonald's ads with

12   Ronald McDonald and Happy Meals?

13        A.   I do.

14        Q.   Beginning in 1972,1 think this is

15   something you mentioned in your direct examination,

16   the year after television and radio ads for

17   cigarettes were banned, isn't it true that every

18   cigarette advertisement by every major tobacco

19   company carried the Surgeon General's warning?

20        A.   That's right.

21         Q.   And as I think that you mentioned, the

22   warnings were on the packs even earlier, starting in

23   about 1966, right?

24        A.   I did mention that, yes.

25        Q.   Do you remember what the warning on the 4829

1   pack said starting in 1966?

2        A.   "Caution: Smoking may be hazardous to

3   your health."

4        Q.   Okay. And then there was a warning that

5   appeared -- well, let me just back up. Congress

6   chose those words, right?

7        A.   Well, Congress passed a law, yes.

8        Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at the warning

9   that ran from 1970 to 1985. Pull up defense

10   demonstrative No. 44, please.

11              Do you remember that this is the ad that

12   ran during that time period -- or warning that

13   appeared on every cigarette package from 1970 to

14    1985?

15        A.   Yes.

16        Q.   And this is the same warning that started

17   to appear in the advertising of these defendants for

18   their products in 1972, correct?

19        A.   That right.

20        Q.   And continued on the pack of every

21    cigarette advertisement until 1985, right?

22        A.   That's right.

23        Q.   And as you put it, Congress passed a law

24   describing what this warning was going to say,

25   right? 4830

1        A.   That's true.

2        Q.   This was information that Mr. Piendle had

3   an opportunity to look at every time he smoked a

4   cigarette, right?

5        A.   It's on the side of the pack.

6        Q.   You don't have any evidence, do you, that

7   Mr. Piendle ever debated or disputed this

8   information, do you?

9        A.   No, not one way or the other.

10        Q.   Let's take a look at defense demonstrative

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=421
11    45.

12             And these, sir, are the four rotating

13   warnings that have appeared in every pack of

14   cigarettes starting in 1985, true?

15        A.   That's true.

16        Q.   These warnings also appeared on every

17   package of cigarettes that Mr. Piendle smoked

18   starting in 1985?

19        A.   Correct.

20        Q.   And on every cigarette advertisement that

21    he saw starting in 1985?

22        A.   That's true.

23        Q.   Now, you displayed advertisements for

24   Winston that ran with the Flintstones television

25   program. Do you remember that? 4831

1        A.   I do.

2        Q.   Okay. And as I recall, Mr. Scarola said,

3   do I need to ask you any questions, and you said no,

4   an exchange like that occurred, as I recall.

5        A.   I think he said, I don't need to ask you

6   any questions about it.

7        Q.   Well, I would like to ask you some

8   questions about it.

9        A.   Right.

10        Q.   Isn't it true that these ads ran in the

11    early 1960s?

12        A.   It did.

13        Q.   Do you know that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

14   Company stopped sponsoring the Flintstones in 1962?

15        A.   I do.

16        Q.   Do you know that when the Flintstones show

17   was first introduced and R.J. Reynolds decided to be

18   a sponsor of it, that it was an adult comedy?

19        A.   It was described that way in TV Guide, I

20   believe, but I used to watch it and I think I was

21    11 years old.

22        Q.   Do you recall that it ran at 8:30 at

23   night?

24        A.   I do. It was a big time to stay up and

25   watch it. 4832

1         Q.   Do you recall that it was modeled after

2   the Honeymooners?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   And do you know that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

5   Company stopped advertising on the Flintstones when

6   it moved to Saturday mornings?

7        A.   They stopped in 1962.

8        Q.   And at that time, the Flintstones stopped

9   being a prime-time, 8:30-in-the-evening show and

10   started to run on Saturdays?

11         A.   Right, for children.

12        Q.   And then they dropped the sponsorship,

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimon^^pgNbr=422
13   right?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   You showed a Winston ad for the Beverly

16   Hillbillies. Do you remember that?

17        A.   Yes.

18        Q.   And do you know that R.J. Reynolds

19   terminated its sponsorship with the Beverly

20   Hillbillies in 1967?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   Do you know that they terminated its

23   sponsorship because audience surveys showed that

24   high levels of minors were watching the show?

25        A.   Following the FTC report that came out in 4833

1    1967, that's true.

2        Q.   And then they dropped it, right?

3        A.   That's right.

4        Q.   You didn't share that information with the

5   jury, did you?

6        A.   I believe the FTC report was part of the

7   evidence that was put in yesterday.

8        Q.   Do you know that Mr. Piendle didn't really

9   smoke Winstons regularly until 1969, two years after

10   Reynolds ended its sponsorship with the Beverly

11    Hillbillies?

12        A.   I know that he was smoking Winston and

13   Marlboro in the 1950s and '60s, and Winston

14   predominantly from the late '60s through the

15   mid-1970s when he went to Raleigh.

16        Q.   Would you agree with me that 1969 is two

17   years after Reynolds ended its sponsorship with the

18   Beverly Hillbillies?

19        A.   I would.

20        Q.   Do you have any evidence that Mr. Piendle

21    ever watched the Beverly Hillbillies?

22        A.   No.

23        Q.   You're not suggesting, are you, that

24   Mr. Piendle was influenced by an ad for Winston

25   brand cigarettes that he did not smoke regularly on 4834

1    a television show that you're not sure he watched,

2   are you?

3        A.   No. It was intended to give the

4   information environment and to illustrate the fact

5   that cigarette advertising was common and was common

6   on popular shows, and the Beverly Hillbillies was

7   shown because it was the most popular show.

8        Q.   You talked about a Reynolds document from

9   the 1980s that discussed younger adult smokers by

10   Diane Burrows and I think the exhibit number was

11    PT3400. Do you remember that?

12        A.   1984, 50-year history.

13        Q.   At that point, Mr. Piendle was in his 40s,

14   right?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=423
15        A.   Well, in 1984, he was in his 40s, but this

16   document goes back 50 years from 1984.

17        Q.   But certainly in 1984, he was not a youth

18   smoker, right?

19        A.   That's true.

20        Q.   Let's talk about that document, it's

21    PT3400?

22        A.   I have it, if you want to save time.

23        Q.   I don't. Otherwise, I would be having

24   briefcases all around me. You're okay with the one

25   you've got? 4835

1        A.   Yeah.

2        Q.   All right. I think you said that this

3   document was evidence of marketing to youth?

4        A.   Yes.

5             THE COURT REPORTER: Marketing to what?

6             MR. BIERSTEKER: To youth. As the day

7        wears on, my voice starts to fade.

8             THE COURT REPORTER: I just want to make

9        sure, thanks.

10     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

11         Q.   Let's take a look at the cover page, if

12   you will, and the title of it is "Younger Adult

13   Smokers," isn't it?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   And if you could turn to the management

16   summary, which I believe you discussed, in part,

17   with the jury yesterday. It says, "This is intended

18   to assist RJR in optimizing its strategic position

19   with respect to younger adult smokers," and then

20   it's defined, isn't it, age 18 to 24, right?

21         A.   Yes, it's defined several places in this

22   document.

23        Q.   It's defined in several places in this

24   document, indeed, it is. It talks about, if you'll

25   turn to page 1, sentence at the top of the page, it 4836

1    articulates a policy of R.J. Reynolds.  "RJR's

2   consistent policy is that smoking is a matter of

3   free, informed adult choice, which the company does

4   not seek to influence." Do you see that?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   You didn't share that excerpt with the

7   jury in the course of your direct testimony either,

8   did you?

9        A.   No.

10        Q.   And instead, one of the things you showed

11    them was Appendix B on page Bates stamped 8256 that

12   was a bell-shaped curve of when smokers started

13   smoking. It's not in the body of the report, right?

14        A.   No, it's referenced on page 2 of the

15   report.

16        Q.   Not in the body of the report, it's in the

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=424
17   appendix, right?

18        A.   Right, under the section Volume.

19        Q.   And what it shows is information about

20   when people start smoking, and I do think that in

21    your direct examination, you allowed, and it's true,

22   that this came from a survey conducted by the

23   Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, that

24   is a part of the United States government, right?

25        A.   That's right. 4837

1         Q.   And, in fact, its successor today would be

2   the Department of Health and Human Services, right?

3        A.   That's true.

4        Q.   And the survey was a survey entitled,

5    "Adult Use of Tobacco," right?

6        A.   That's right.

7        Q.   So what happened was the government went

8   out and surveyed adults, I think they were age 17

9   and older, might have been 18 and older, I'm not

10   sure, and they asked adults when did you start

11    smoking regularly, right?

12        A.   That's right.

13        Q.   These are the answers that adults gave to

14   the survey that the government conducted, right?

15        A.   That's right.

16        Q.   And there's no information in this survey

17   about brands, is there?

18        A.   In the adult use of tobacco survey?

19        Q.   That's correct.

20        A.   I believe they didn't report it here. I

21    don't know whether that survey collected brands or

22   not.

23        Q.   If there were brand data in the

24   government-sponsored survey on adults on the use of

25   tobacco in 1970 and 1975, it was not something that 4838

1   Ms. Burrows thought ought to be included in her

2   report, true?

3        A.   And I can correct the statement for '70

4   and '75,1 know the Adult Use of Tobacco surveys

5   didn't collect brand information.

6        Q.   Okay. Thank you.

7             Are you aware of any other references to

8   people under the age of 18 in this document, other

9   than in connection with the government survey?

10        A.   Well, on page 2, they talk about, "Younger

11    adult smokers are the only source of replacement

12   smokers," and then they say, "Repeated government

13   studies, Appendix B, have shown that less than

14   one-third of smokers start after the age of 18," and

15   that's consistent with my knowledge.

16        Q.   Would you agree with me that there are 200

17   references in this document to younger adult smokers

18   and that each time when it is defined, it is defined

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=425
19   as age 18 to 24?

20        A.   No, they use age 18, and then they're

21    referring to 18-year-old smokers repeatedly and the

22   reference is to 18 and under. They're talking about

23   first usual brand choice, and that's why they

24   included this appendix.

25        Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that nowhere in this 4839

1   memo does it suggest that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

2   Company introduced a brand targeted to individuals

3   under the age of 18?

4        A.   That's not my interpretation of this

5   document at all. It's -- my interpretation is they

6   know that the replacement smokers come predominantly

7   two-thirds from 18 

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry to

9        interrupt, Doctor, but I object to

10        interpretation of the document. I asked him

11         what document said.

12             THE COURT: Why don't you rephrase the

13        question.

14     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

15        Q.   Anyplace in this document, does it say

16   that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company should target

17   individuals under the age of 18 with a particular

18   cigarette brand or a particular cigarette

19   advertisement, does that say that in words anywhere

20   in the document?

21         A.   Those specific words were not used.

22        Q.   When this document was written in 1984,

23   isn't it true that 18 years old in this country was

24   an age at which it was legal to smoke in every

25   state? 4840

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   Isn't it true that one of the key findings

3   in this report is that the younger adult smokers

4   switched brands?

5        A.   They do.

6        Q.   And isn't it true that the report

7   concludes that because younger adult smokers, at age

8    18 to 24, switch brands, that's a pretty good target

9   for the company to be looking at?

10        A.   That's one of the targets that they were

11    looking at, which is current smokers to switch from

12   their competitors' brand to their brand. So

13   Marlboro over to, say, Camel or Winston, as well as

14   getting replacement smokers, new smokers, and it was

15   a recognition that brand loyalties are established

16   early.

17        Q.   Let me ask you a couple of questions. And

18   I want to take it in a couple of bites. So let's

19   start with addiction.

20        A.   Sure.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=426
21         Q.   As we discussed, in 1988, the Surgeon

22   General's report used a definition that was

23   different than what it had used in 1964, right?

24        A.   Yes.

25        Q.   And-4841

1        A.   I testified to that.

2        Q.   I'm sorry.

3        A.   I think I said that earlier.

4        Q.   You did. It's a predicate. Isn't it true

5   that it was after the 1988 report issued that the

6   tobacco industry began to deny, in a public way,

7   that smoking is addictive?

8        A.   Certainly after the '88 report, they

9   challenged the conclusions of that report.

10        Q.   Isn't it true that you did not show the

11   jury any statement by the tobacco industry denying

12   that cigarette smoking was addictive that was

13   released prior to 1988, that's published prior to

14    1988?

15        A.   A public statement, no. They talked about

16   addiction in internal records before.

17        Q.   I meant a public statement, Doctor.

18             Is there any evidence that Mr. Piendle

19   smoked for one year between 1988 and his final

20   decision to quit smoking in 1989 because the tobacco

21    industry resisted the label of addiction with

22   respect to cigarette smoking and nicotine?

23        A.   No.

24        Q.   Is there any evidence that Mr. Piendle

25   actually saw or heard any industry denial starting 4842

1   in 1988 that cigarette smoking or nicotine is

2   addictive?

3        A.   There's no record either way.

4        Q.   There's no reference in the record that

5   you reviewed that Mr. Piendle saw or heard any

6   statement issued by the Tobacco Industry Research

7   Council or CTR or TI, is there?

8        A.   No, there is nothing in the record that --

9   I think the record says that some of the family

10   members were asked whether they heard of those

11    organizations, and they haven't.

12        Q.   Would you agree with me that Mr. Piendle

13   knew how hard or how easy it was for him to quit,

14   starting whenever he made that first New Year's

15   resolution to quit?

16        A.   I'm not sure I understand the question.

17        Q.   Sure. You talked about New Year's

18   resolutions, right?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   And how the Piendles, at uncertain times,

21    in the 1970s and in the 1980s, made New Year's

22   resolutions to quit?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=427
23        A.   Multiple times, I think five times or

24   something like that.

25        Q.   Okay. Fine. After that very first New 4843

1   Year's resolution, did Mr. Piendle have an

2   appreciation for how easy or difficult it was for

3   him personally to quit smoking?

4        A.   The --1 can't speak to Mr. Piendle

5   because, you know, obviously, he's not available to

6   give the testimony. I can only speak to the record

7   that I reviewed from family members, particularly

8   Mr. Piendle's daughter, who said she felt her dad

9   was addicted.

10             MR. BIERSTEKER: I object and move to

11         strike as nonresponsive, your Honor.

12             THE COURT: I will grant the motion and

13        have the testimony stricken and ask counsel to

14        state the question again and see if the witness

15        can answer the question again as phrased.

16     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

17        Q.   Based upon his experiences in trying to

18   quit smoking in connection with New Year's

19   resolutions, would you agree with me that

20   Mr. Piendle, had there ever been any doubt in his

21    mind earlier about whether smoking could be hard to

22   quit, appreciated it?

23        A.   Whether he appreciated it was hard to

24   quit, yes.

25        Q.   You would agree that he had that 4844

1    appreciation?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   There's no evidence that Mr. Piendle ever

4   said, I'm not going to quit because smoking isn't

5   addictive, is there?

6        A.   No.

7        Q.   Let's talk a little bit about the Frank

8   Statement, it ran for one time, one day only,

9   January 4th, 1954, right?

10        A.   It ran as a newspaper ad for one day only

11    on January 4th, 1954, but was repeated many times by

12   spokespeople. I think I showed Mr. Hartnett

13   reiterating elements on a TV show.

14        Q.   Sure, I'm not arguing with you. Is there

15   any evidence that Mr. Piendle ever saw, heard of, or

16   read the Frank Statement?

17        A.   No.

18        Q.   Is there any evidence that he discussed

19   the Frank Statement with anybody?

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   We know, do we not, that Mr. Piendle was

22   exposed to information about the dangers of smoking

23   throughout his life, don't we?

24        A.   Yes.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=428
25        Q.   Okay. He called, for example, cigarettes 4845

1    "cancer sticks" and "coffin nails" back when he was

2   in high school, right?

3             MR. SCAROLA: Objection, repetitious.

4             THE COURT: Sustained.

5     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

6        Q.   Isn't it true that in the -- starting in

7   the 1970s, based upon your review of the

8   depositions, Mr. Piendle's friends and family

9   members increasingly began to quit smoking?

10        A.   In the 1950s?

11         Q.   1970s.

12        A.   1970s, yes, more and more people were

13   quitting smoking as time went on.

14        Q.   Isn't it true that those friends and

15   family members often urged Mr. Piendle to quit?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   Would you agree that Mr. Piendle saw

18   doctors more often than most men of his age

19   throughout his life because of certain underlying

20   medical conditions?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   And you know from reviewing the medical

23   records that he was often asked about his smoking,

24   right?

25        A.   That's right. 4846

1         Q.   Would you agree that it's probable his

2   doctors told him to quit?

3        A.   Not necessarily.

4        Q.   Okay. There's no evidence, is there, that

5   Mr. Piendle ever said, forget about the warnings, or

6   the tobacco industry says it's not prudent, is

7   there?

8        A.   No, there's no evidence.

9        Q.   There's no evidence in this record that

10   establishes that Mr. Piendle actually relied upon

11    any statement by tobacco companies; isn't that true?

12        A.   Well, the evidence is the brands that he

13   smoked. His smoking history is the best evidence of

14   his reliance on the statements from different

15   companies.

16        Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at your

17   deposition, again, from April 3rd, 2010, in this

18   case, and I think everybody's got a copy. If we

19   could turn, please, to page 152. Starting at the

20   top, line 1 to line 5, you were asked this question,

21    sir:

22             "Is there any record that establishes that

23   Mr. Piendle actually relied on any statement made by

24   a tobacco company, this is case specific testimony,

25   not generic?" 4847

1              Answer:  "No, nothing that I can recall

2   offhand."

3             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, that's exactly

4        consistent with what the witness has just said.

5             THE COURT: Okay. Well --

6     BY MR. BIERSTEKER:

7        Q.   Wasn't that your answer, sir?

8             THE COURT: Okay. I'll allow the

9        question.

10        A.   Yes, that was my answer.

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: Okay. Thank you.

12             I have nothing further, your Honor.

13             THE COURT: Okay. Philip Morris'

14        cross-examination, please.

15                     CROSS-EXAMINATION

16     BY MR. KELLY:

17        Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings. How are

18   you? How are you doing?

19        A.   I'm doing good.

20        Q.   Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

21              Good afternoon, your Honor.

22             Dr. Cummings, I'm going to do my best to

23   finish my examination this afternoon, and I'm going

24   to do my best to ask you clear and understandable

25   questions, but I warn you ahead of time that I'm 4848

1    going to jump around a little bit because I'm going

2   to try very hard not to cover things that have

3   already been covered in the same kind of depth that

4   they have already been covered. So if I'm heading

5   off in a new direction and you're not with me, you

6   let me know.

7        A.   I will do that.

8        Q.   All right. Thank you.

9             Just a little bit ago, you said that, I'm

10   going to paraphrase here, I know what brands

11    Mr. Piendle smoked and when he smoked them, and gave

12   us an example of when he was a youth.

13        A.   That's right.

14        Q.   I want to make sure that we understand

15   what you mean when you say, I know something like

16   that, okay?

17        A.   Okay.

18        Q.   You don't know, you did not know

19   Mr. Piendle.

20        A.   No.

21         Q.   Mr. Piendle was born in 1941 and grew up

22   in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in a place called the

23   Hollow, according to his brother, Edward. Have you

24   ever been there?

25        A.   In Bridgeport, yes. 4849

1         Q.   In the Hollow?

2        A.   In the Hollow, I don't know if I've been

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=430
3   in the Hollow or not.

4        Q.   So when you say that I know something

5   about Mr. Piendle, is what you really mean that I've

6   read or heard something about Mr. Piendle from the

7   materials that you've been provided and reviewed in

8   this case?

9        A.   That's true.

10        Q.   All right.

11         A.   From the records I've reviewed.

12        Q.   All right. So with respect to information

13   that you don't have from firsthand knowledge, that

14   would be information from secondhand knowledge from

15   somebody who probably did know Mr. Piendle, like his

16   wife or his brother or his friend, Babe Cabral?

17        A.   Right. Or other friends who knew him at

18   different times, brother, sister, right.

19        Q.   Yes. And you would defer to their

20   testimony concerning what they recall about

21    Mr. Piendle over your memory of what you might have

22   read or heard, wouldn't you?

23        A.   I relied on their testimony that I

24   reviewed, look at the brand history, there were also

25   interrogatories, worksheet that was completed that I 4850

1   relied on, as well as the medical records.

2        Q.   Right. So their testimony in the form of

3   a deposition is what you relied upon for what you

4   tell the jury you know?

5        A.   So far, yes.

6        Q.   All right. So to the extent that there

7   might be a difference between what you told the jury

8   you know about Mr. Piendle and what the witnesses

9   said they remembered about Mr. Piendle, what the

10   witnesses said would be what we should rely upon,

11    correct?

12             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. Are

13        we talking about trial testimony?

14             MR. KELLY: Yes, we are.

15             MR. SCAROLA: I ask simply that the Court

16        instruct the jury that we are prohibited from

17        informing witnesses about the testimony that

18        has occurred during the course of a trial as a

19        matter of procedure.

20             MR. KELLY: Sure, that's fine. That would

21         help, your Honor. May I?

22             THE COURT: Yes.

23     BY MR. KELLY:

24        Q.   You have not, because there is a court

25   order prohibiting it, you have not examined any of 4851

1   the testimony that's gone on here in court?

2        A.   No, I haven't.

3        Q.   That's an important procedure that her

4   Honor put in place, all the witnesses are subject to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=431
5   that, you understand that?

6        A.   I understand that.

7        Q.   It's a typical procedure in a court of

8   law.

9        A.   I'm not allowed to talk to anybody about

10   the case or the testimony I'm giving.

11         Q.   Right. So to the extent that the

12   witnesses who actually knew Mr. Piendle provided a

13   memory of Mr. Piendle that might be different than

14   what you know, you would defer to what the witnesses

15   recalled, wouldn't you?

16        A.   I would -- no. What I know is I've relied

17   on the deposition testimony and I'm not deferring

18   anything. It's what I've come in to testify to, and

19   I'm basing my testimony on what I've reviewed in

20   order to prepare my testimony over the last several

21    days.

22        Q.   Was that a "yes"?

23        A.   I'm not deferring to anything because I

24   don't know what I'm deferring to. I'm just

25   explaining to the jury and to you what I relied upon 4852

1   for my testimony.

2        Q.   All right. Can I have the ELMO, please.

3   And it's not Keith, it's --

4             MR. TELOFSKI: Jeff.

5             MR. KELLY: Thank you, Jeff.

6     BY MR. KELLY:

7        Q.   Okay. With respect to testimony that

8   you've provided over the last several days

9   concerning events that occurred, meetings that took

10   place, activities that were undertaken back in the

11    '40s and '50s and '60s, for example, meetings you

12   didn't attend, activities you didn't participate in

13   at that time, when you say you know something about

14   that based upon what you've read or heard, you're

15   offering an opinion, correct?

16        A.   Yes. I review the evidence, and from that

17   evidence form an opinion.

18        Q.   All right. So when you say, for example,

19    "I know what happened in 1954," you've reviewed some

20   material about things that happened in 1954, and you

21    have an opinion about what happened back then,

22   correct?

23        A.   Right. I believe it was couched based on

24   the research that I have done and reviewed and --

25   yes, and I form an opinion based on that evidence 4853

1   that I've reviewed.

2        Q.   You have reviewed -- you have available to

3   review many millions of documents at Roswell Park

4   and through various online resources that you have

5   available to research, correct?

6        A.   That's right.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=432
7        Q.   You have individually reviewed some 10,000

8   or so documents that you've culled from that

9   material?

10        A.   I've reviewed many, many documents.

11         Q.   Best estimate, about 10,000?

12        A.   I might have testified to that. I've

13   never counted up all the documents. It's a lot that

14   I've reviewed personally, but I certainly haven't

15   read 60 million pages of material.

16        Q.   Do you recall giving your best estimate at

17   about 10,000?

18        A.   I do.

19        Q.   Just for a comparative reference then, if

20   we had 16 million documents, and you've reviewed,

21   best estimate, 10,000 of those, that would be one

22   document for every 1600 that were available, if we

23   did our math right.

24        A.   Out of how many documents?

25        Q.   16 million. 4854

1        A.   16 million documents. It's pages that I

2   received with 16 million pages. There's a smaller

3   number of documents because some of the documents,

4   as you can see, are a hundred pages long.

5        Q.   Okay.  16 million pages, 10,000 pages, one

6   for every 1600. Just as a frame of reference.

7        A.   Okay. I'll give you that frame. I

8   haven't reviewed every document.

9        Q.   1600 pieces of a puzzle, you've reviewed

10   one piece of the puzzle, as a comparative example.

11         A.   The puzzle pieces have been focused on in

12   certain places.

13        Q.   And you're not representing to the jury

14   that you've read or reviewed all of the documents

15   that might be relevant to a particular subject that

16   you testified here in court on, right?

17        A.   No. I've tried to do a thorough job in

18   reviewing documents for the areas that I testified

19   on before this jury and other juries.

20        Q.   I think earlier in the afternoon you had

21   been asked to take a look at Exhibit 274,

22   your Honor, for identification.

23             Do you still have that up there in front

24   of you, Dr. Cummings?

25        A.   I do. Is this the March 3rd, 1954? 4855

1         Q.   It is, Dr. Cummings.

2        A.   March 5th, I'm sorry.

3        Q.   We both need to take our glasses off to

4   read. Sign of the age, I'm sure.

5        A.   Yes, it is.

6        Q.   March 5th, 1954. After the Frank

7   Statement was published on that one day in January,

8   Hill & Knowlton was the public relations

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testim^^pgNbr=433
9   committee -- or company who put that Frank Statement

10   together for dissemination, coordinated the

11    dissemination, correct?

12        A.   That's true.

13        Q.   Hill & Knowlton had archives maintained,

14   Mr. Hill maintained archives for his company,

15   correct?

16        A.   Mr. Hill had his archives that were turned

17   over to the University of Wisconsin, of which many

18   of the minute meetings -- minutes of meetings come

19   from that archive.

20        Q.   And among those archives, which you have

21    reviewed --

22        A.   That's right.

23        Q.    is this or was this Exhibit 2743, that

24   you have in front of you, dated March 5th, 1954,

25   correct? 4856

1        A.   That's right.

2        Q.   Sorry?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Yes. And you've seen this in courtrooms

5   before. You recall in January of 2009 being shown

6   this document?

7        A.   As I testified just a few moments ago, I

8   didn't recall seeing this document. I recall being

9   asked in prior testimony about the poll that's

10   referenced in the document. I don't recall seeing

11    the document. It doesn't mean that I haven't been

12   shown the document, I just don't recall it.

13        Q.   All right. But you do then recall now the

14   poll that is referenced in the document?

15        A.   That's what I testified to earlier, yes.

16             MR. KELLY: All right. May we show 2743,

17        your Honor, for identification, just the --

18             Do you have a copy?

19             MR. SCAROLA: I do.

20     BY MR. KELLY:

21         Q.   Just the last paragraph, please.

22             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I have no

23        objection to this document being admitted into

24        evidence, but based upon the testimony we have

25        heard, it should not be shown until such time 4857

1         as it is admitted into evidence.

2             MR. KELLY: That's the same objection as

3        before, your Honor.

4             MR. SCAROLA: Quite respectfully --

5             MR. KELLY: Can I not be interrupted?

6             MR. SCAROLA:  -- specified that he relied

7        upon documents.

8             MR. BIERSTEKER: Sidebar?

9             THE COURT: 2743, was that not admitted in

10        plaintiffs case?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=434
11              MR. KELLY: It was not, your Honor.

12             THE COURT: So do you want to lay a

13        predicate?

14             MR. KELLY: Sure. I just did, your Honor.

15     BY MR. KELLY:

16        Q.   This is from the Hill & Knowlton archives,

17   from which you have obtained other materials that

18   you've reviewed as part of your historical research

19   into the period of 1954, correct?

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   Right. And this references a subsequent

22   work to the Frank Statement investigating the impact

23   of the Frank Statement through a survey that was

24   done, correct?

25        A.   Yes, it is referencing that survey. 4858

1         Q.   It's reported on Hill & Knowlton

2   stationery.

3        A.   It is.

4        Q.   It's dated March 5th, 1954,

5   contemporaneous to the survey that's referenced

6   there.

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   This is a historical document providing

9   context and perspective to the Frank Statement,

10   correct?

11         A.   That's correct.

12             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'd like to show

13        the last paragraph.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I have no objection to the

15        admission of the document.

16             MR. KELLY: Okay.

17             MR. SCAROLA: Can we approach the bench?

18        I'd like to explain the concerns.

19             MR. KELLY: Why is there an interruption?

20             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

21         held out of the presence of the jury:)

22             THE COURT REPORTER: Hold on. Hold on.

23             THE COURT: --relied upon this in

24        rendering --

25             MR. SCAROLA: He doesn't recall seeing it 4859

1        before, that's the problem.

2             MR. KELLY: This is a piece of evidence,

3        your Honor. This is a historical document

4        putting into perspective and context the 1954

5        Frank Statement from an archive of the business

6        records of the company that put the Frank

7        Statement out.

8             I have established a business record

9        exception to it based upon this witness'

10        testimony. I just want to show it to him. He

11        knows what it is now, he's seen it in trials

12        before.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=435
13             THE COURT: Okay. Well --

14             MR. SCAROLA: Maybe I haven't made my

15        position clear.

16             THE COURT: Do you not want it into

17        evidence?

18             MR. KELLY: I thought we were deferring

19        moving things into evidence.

20             MR. SCAROLA: I want it in evidence, but I

21         don't want it shown.

22             MR. KELLY: Then why are you objecting?

23             MR. SCAROLA: I don't want it shown until

24        it's admitted into evidence.

25             THE COURT: Do you have an objection to 4860

1         counsel for plaintiff moving it into evidence

2        in his case?

3             MR. KELLY: I don't think so. Certainly,

4        not this part I'm going to show. It's just the

5        survey.

6             THE COURT: I'm deferring. I've deferred

7        on the issues. If the witness has reasonably

8        relied upon it and stated that, I did not

9        believe, and absent seeing a case that it

10        needed to be admitted into evidence, this seems

11         different because he's not relied upon it.

12             Are you using it to --

13             MR. KELLY: As a piece of evidence. And

14        if he wants to move it into evidence, I don't

15        have any objection.

16             MR. SCAROLA: In evidence.

17             MR. KELLY: If you want to put it into

18        evidence.

19             THE COURT: On redirect you can put it

20        into evidence, and there would be no objection.

21              MR. SCAROLA: I don't want it shown to the

22        jury unless and until it is admitted into

23        evidence, it should not be shown to the jury.

24             MR. KELLY: Here's the problem,

25        your Honor. 4861

1              THE COURT: One at a time.

2             MR. SCAROLA:  Since the exception that

3        your Honor is operating under is that if a

4        document has been relied upon by the witness,

5        it need not be otherwise admissible.

6             THE COURT: Correct.

7             MR. SCAROLA: And I understand that this

8        document does not fall within those parameters,

9        therefore, the ordinary rules of evidence

10        should apply, and you don't get to put it up

11         until it's admitted into evidence. And I don't

12        object to it being admitted. That's my only

13        point.

14             MR. KELLY: Throughout the entire

15        plaintiffs case up until now, if there was no

16        objection to the document, the rule on

17        admissibility was deferred, and we were --

18        plaintiff was allowed to go forward with the

19        examination without interruption. And here

20        there is no objection, just an interruption.

21              THE COURT: I'm going to allow you to put

22        it up and allow it to go into evidence when it

23        is moved in by plaintiffs counsel. 24

2        concluded and the following proceedings were

4             MR. KELLY: All set, your Honor?

5             THE COURT: All set.

6             MR. KELLY: All right.

7             MR. SCAROLA: Yes, as long as the

8        understanding is it will be admitted, I have no

9        problem, your Honor.

10     BY MR. KELLY:

11         Q.   2743, please. Thank you, Mr. Ferrell.

12             The photograph regarding Legler, on the

13   first page.

14             All right. Are you with me, Dr. Cummings?

15        A.   I am.

16        Q.   This is after the Frank Statement was

17   published, the survey was done, Hill & Knowlton is

18   reporting on the survey, indicating that "Legler

19   told me they had conducted a survey of 400-odd

20   smokers to check the effect of the January 4 ad on

21    smoker habits. Their survey, he said, showed that

22   the ad had scared people into cutting down and in

23   some cases stopping their use of tobacco entirely."

24             Correct?

25        A.   Correct. 4863

1         Q.   This information about the effect on

2   smokers of the Frank Statement you did not have

3   until approximately a year ago, correct?

4        A.   That was true.

5        Q.   So for all the time over the last 15 years

6   you've been talking about the Frank Statement and

7   its affect on reassuring smokers were opinions you

8   were providing without complete information,

9   correct?

10        A.   Well, I wasn't aware of the poll that had

11   been done until about a year ago, and I'm familiar

12   with the poll and not this particular memo.

13        Q.   You didn't tell the jury about this poll

14   in your direct examination when you were talking

15   about the Frank Statement and its effect on smokers,

16   did you?

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=437
17        A.   No, I-

18        Q.   Even though you knew about it.

19        A.   Fair.

20        Q.   Putting things in context in understanding

21    historical documents, especially those that go back

22   30, 40, 50 or even 60 years, can be a difficult

23   thing to do, correct?

24        A.   It is.

25        Q.   For example, some of the people identified 4864

1   in the documents -- and I'm going to focus now on

2   the Philip Morris documents that you've reviewed and

3   some of which you've shown to the jury. Let me see

4   how I can do this by memory.

5             Dr. Wakeham, is Dr. Wakeham still alive?

6        A.   No.

7        Q.   How long has it been since he's worked for

8   the company?

9        A.   I don't know when he resigned from the

10   company. I don't have that knowledge right offhand.

11         Q.   Mr. Weissman is referenced in a couple of

12   these documents back in the 1960s. Is Mr. Weissman

13   still alive?

14        A.   No, he's deceased.

15        Q.   Mr. Joseph Cullman, is he still alive?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   Mr. Seligman, is Dr. Seligman still alive?

18        A.   That, I don't know.

19        Q.   How long has it been since he's worked for

20   the company?

21         A.   I don't know.

22        Q.   Mr. Johnston, there's an M. Johnston who

23   is referenced in some of these documents. Is he

24   still alive?

25        A.   Myron Johnston. I don't know if Myron 4865

1   Johnston is still alive or not.

2        Q.   How long has it been since he's worked for

3   the company?

4        A.   The last of his documents were in the

5    1980s that I recall reviewing. Of course he had

6   references into the '60s. So he spanned a long

7   period of time.

8        Q.   Dr. Dunn, there's some materials from

9   Dr. Dunn that you referenced. Is Dr. Dunn still

10   alive?

11         A.   I don't know.

12        Q.   How long has it been since Dr. Dunn has

13   worked for the company?

14        A.   Most of the documents from Dr. Dunn are in

15   the '60s and '70s, so that's what I know of

16   Dr. Dunn.

17        Q.   You recall that some of his documentation,

18   I think you've reviewed it, indicates he started

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=438
19   with the company back in the '60s.

20        A.   That's correct. And I have references of

21    memos that he received in 1963, Dr. Seligman in

22    1961, Dr. Wakeham was copied on some of those

23   memorandum.

24        Q.   So for some of these very, very old

25   documents that had been written, the folks who 4866

1    actually wrote them just aren't available to come in

2   and explain what they said, are they?

3        A.   No. There are some people who work with

4   them who I've spoken to for context, and then you

5   look at and you try to follow the threads of

6   material together to try to construct an accurate

7   history.

8        Q.   Well, threads of material might be a good

9   analogy because you try to weave a story with those

10   threads, correct?

11         A.   Well, you try to get an accurate picture

12   of what's going on.

13        Q.   And if you don't have all the threads,

14   you're not going to have the right story, correct?

15        A.   You try to do the best you can with the

16   evidence, and it's a weight of evidence approach.

17        Q.   You've been talking about a document that

18   Mr. Weissman wrote in 1964, about two weeks after

19   the Surgeon General's report was published.

20        A.   Right, to Joe Cullman, the president of

21    the company, and also served on the executive

22   committee for The Tobacco Institute at that time.

23        Q.   That's right. The letter that indicates

24   that Mr. Weissman was heading out on a trip and

25   jotting down some thoughts he had after he reviewed 4867

1   the Surgeon General's report, correct?

2        A.   That's correct. Thoughts on the Surgeon

3   General's report, January 29th, 1964.

4        Q.   Is there anywhere indicated in that

5   document -- it is in evidence, the jury is going to

6   have a chance to take look at it, but do you

7   remember from memory whether there is any reference

8   by Mr. Weissman as to what parts of the Surgeon

9   General report he reviewed?

10        A.   I don't believe so. I'm not sure he had

11    reviewed the report.

12        Q.   I'm sorry?

13        A.   I think he was commenting on the publicity

14   from the report.

15        Q.   Well, that would be--all right. I'm

16   sorry, that's your thought on that, that's your

17   opinion.

18        A.   Well, actually, why don't I just get the

19   document. I have it here.

20        Q.   Get the document, and I won't ask you

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=439
21    questions while you're looking.

22        A.   Sure.

23        Q.   Let me know when you're ready.

24             The question for you, Dr. Cummings, is

25   whether the document indicates what portions of the 4868

1    Surgeon General's report issued a couple of weeks

2   before, if any, Mr. Weissman had reviewed before he

3   wrote this memo?

4        A.   I'm not sure he mentions which portions

5   he's reviewed. It says, "Reaction. While the

6   propaganda blast was tremendous and the penetration

7   of public opinion was very widespread, I have the

8   feeling that public reaction was not as fear, nor

9   did it have the emotional depth I might have

10   feared."

11         Q.   Does that tell us what portion of the

12   Surgeon General's report Mr. Weissman reviewed

13   before writing this memo?

14        A.   No, it's --

15        Q.   That was my question, Dr. Cummings.

16        A.   -- my recollection what the memo was about

17   was the reaction to the Surgeon General's report.

18        Q.   Up until about five years ago, it was your

19   opinion, based upon what you've reviewed, that the

20   term "psychological crutch" that appears in this

21    memo was a word, a phrase coined by Mr. Weissman,

22   right?

23        A.   No.

24             MR. KELLY: May I have a moment,

25        your Honor, while I get a transcript? 4869

1              THE COURT: Yes.

2     BY MR. KELLY:

3        Q.   Dr. Cummings, the "psychological crutch"

4   reference in the Weissman memo is the exact same

5   phrase that the Surgeon General used in the report

6   published two weeks before, correct?

7        A.   I don't know whether they used the word

8   "psychological crutch" in the report issued two

9   weeks before, but he's saying he must give smokers a

10   psychological crutch and self-rationale to continue

11    smoking. That's what I found of interest.

12        Q.   You've been testifying about that term

13    "psychological crutch" and suggesting to juries what

14   it means since you began testifying 15 years ago,

15   correct?

16        A.   I've been testifying, and I think the

17   document speaks for itself.

18        Q.   For 15 years you've been talking about

19   that term from this document, correct?

20        A.   Sure.

21         Q.   And even today, you don't know whether two

22   weeks before the Surgeon General used the term

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=440
23    "psychological crutch" in describing the beneficial

24   effects of cigarette smoking; is that true?

25        A.   The reference here is very clear, and 4870

1   while the term "psychological crutch" is used in the

2   general vocabulary and may have been used in past

3   Surgeon General's reports, this is not referencing

4   that report. It's talking about giving smokers, in

5   response to the report, under the heading "Public

6   Relations Program," reflecting on the same

7   seriousness with which we met the report, we must in

8   the near future provide some answers which will give

9   smokers a psychological crutch and a self-rationale

10   to continue smoking. The answer --

11         Q.   Dr. Cummings --

12             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I think the

13        witness is entitled to complete his response.

14             THE COURT: Complete your response.

15             MR. KELLY: It's nonresponsive. I move to

16        strike the entire answer. The question was:

17        Do you know whether the term "psychological

18        crutch" is in the Surgeon General's report that

19        came out two weeks before under the discussion

20        of beneficial effects of tobacco smoke.

21              MR. SCAROLA: And that is exactly the

22        question the witness was responding to,

23        your Honor --

24             MR. KELLY: That's a yes or no.

25             MR. SCAROLA: -- acknowledging that no 4871

1        matter how it may have appeared --

2             THE COURT: I'll allow the witness to

3        answer the question, and if you need to

4        explain.

5             MR. KELLY: Can I get a "yes" or "no" to

6        that, your Honor?

7             THE COURT: If the witness can answer yes

8        or no and then explain, you should do that.

9        A.   It may have appeared in the '64 report or

10   other reports, I don't recall offhand. However,

11    that's not the context in which the term

12   "psychological crutch" is used here, I think it's

13   rather clear, as this was coming from the director

14   of marketing, George Weissman, to the head of the

15   company, talking about a public relations program.

16             MR. KELLY: Move to strike the

17        interpretation reference, your Honor, and ask

18        the jury to disregard it.

19             THE COURT: The document speaks for

20        itself, so any testimony regarding

21         interpretation of the document is not to be

22        considered.

23             And this document is in evidence?

24             MR. KELLY: Yes, your Honor, as is the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=441
25        Surgeon General's report of 1964. At least --4872

1              MR. SCAROLA: No, but we are happy to have

2        it in evidence.

3             MR. KELLY: At least this portion is.

4             MR. SALES: We would like it offered.

5             MR. KELLY: You haven't yet.

6             MR. SALES: No.

7     BY MR. KELLY:

8        Q.   Dr. Cummings, we have more to cover, and

9   time is ticking, so let me move on to a different

10   topic.

11              A couple of things about your work as a

12   consultant for attorneys suing tobacco companies.

13             You recall that the seminar that you

14   participated in in Boston in 2002 for plaintiffs

15   attorneys had you presenting on two topics, one of

16   those was resources for attorneys suing tobacco

17   companies. Do you recall that?

18        A.   Yeah. It was in the document repositories

19   which have been turned over to New York State by the

20   state attorney general and I was researching and

21    collecting and putting up online, as well as

22   examples of advertising and such.

23        Q.   Right. And you were described as a

24   resource for attorneys who were thinking about suing

25   tobacco companies at that seminar, correct? 4873

1        A.   I'm not sure what I was referred to. I

2   was asked to come in and talk about the work that we

3   were doing, digitizing the material, and

4   specifically giving a lecture on the Frank

5   Statement, and then these archives of materials that

6   I was -- had put together.

7        Q.   You just don't recall that you were

8   referenced under the resource section, is that it?

9        A.   I didn't put together the pamphlet for the

10   conference.

11         Q.   You did do networking with the plaintiff

12   attorneys who were interested in suing tobacco

13   companies as part of the seminar, didn't you?

14        A.   Sure. I mean, networking in the sense

15   that, you know, there was a lunch that was held.

16        Q.   Well, in the sense that since that

17   seminar, some of those attorneys who attended did

18   hire you for their cases, correct?

19        A.   That's true.

20        Q.   All right. And since that time, you have,

21    as part of your work, done the document work at --

22   continue to do the document work at Roswell with the

23   tobacco company documents, correct?

24        A.   It was -- yes, it was a ten-year effort.

25   It was a massive effort, 16 million pages to 4874

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=442
1    digitize, fills up probably four sizes of this

2   courtroom, floor to ceiling, with documents. So it

3   was a big effort and took a long time to complete,

4   and then we're still in the process of reviewing the

5   material that we've digitized.

6        Q.   Some of the money that you were funded

7   with came from the ALF, correct?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   Explain to the -- that -- ALF stands for

10   American Legacy Foundation?

11         A.   Or ALF.

12        Q.   Which is a fund, a fund that is, or was

13   initially funded with monies from the tobacco

14   companies.

15        A.   That's right. From the master settlement

16   agreement they created the American Legacy

17   Foundation, and they have funded research as well as

18   are responsible for doing campaigns to educate young

19   people in particular about the risks of smoking.

20        Q.   So the tobacco companies funded the

21    American Legacy Foundation, which put out

22   anti-tobacco advertising and funded some of your

23   work which allows you, then, to come into court and

24   testify against tobacco companies, correct?

25        A.   Well, it's a mischaracterization. I think 4875

1   the tobacco companies, in an agreement with the

2   state attorney generals, turned over money, and part

3   of the agreement was that there would be a national

4   organization created called the American Legacy

5   Foundation, which would have the intent as part of

6   the agreement that was worked out by the state

7   attorney generals with the tobacco companies.

8        Q.   The money that you receive when you come

9   into court and testify as a custodian of those

10   documents is money that you receive, correct?

11         A.   The money that was received in the grants

12   go to Roswell Park Cancer Institute. I'm just the

13   principal investigator. I've never collected a dime

14   from that research. It goes to support the

15   librarians and the research assistants who helped

16   with that work. And I come in here on my own time

17   and give the testimony based on the research that

18   I've done.

19        Q.   Bad question on my part.

20             When you come in here on your own time and

21    testify in court or in deposition or work on behalf

22   of lawyers suing tobacco companies, you are paid

23   money, $300 or $100 an hour, depending on what you

24   do?

25        A.   That's right. I receive payments, half of 4876

1   which go back to Roswell Park.

2        Q.   Do they go back to Roswell Park through

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=443
3   you, or do they go back to Roswell Park directly?

4        A.   They go back through me.

5        Q.   All right. So when did you start sending

6   some of your income from litigation to a charitable

7   foundation at Roswell Park?

8        A.   I started this past April.

9        Q.   This past April, April of 2010?

10        A.   That's correct.

11         Q.   All right. Before April of 2010, the

12   money that you received from the work over the last

13    15 years assisting lawyers in suing tobacco

14   companies was in addition to your salary at Roswell

15   Park, correct?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   And it was your earnings on your vacation

18   time, that went directly to you?

19        A.   That's true.

20        Q.   And you're doing the work, so there's

21    nothing wrong with that, but it went directly to

22   you, and for the last six months or so, you have

23   decided to donate charitable donation, some of that

24   income to a fund at Roswell?

25        A.   That's correct. 4877

1         Q.   All right. We can go back and look at

2   that old transcript, but we're going to move

3   forward.

4             You had mentioned a moment ago that you

5   thought that the scientific advisory for the CTR and

6   TIRC was coordinated or supervised by some

7   attorneys. Do you recall that?

8        A.   The organizational structure for TIRC,

9   CTR, and TI was the same, and there was an executive

10   committee made up of the executives of the tobacco

11    companies, under that group was a committee of

12   lawyers, also called the Committee on Counsel, there

13   were also ad hoc committees that spun off of that,

14   and there was a Scientific Advisory Board and other

15   health communications committees and so on.

16        Q.   The Scientific Advisory Board is the

17   organization made up of the outside scientists and

18   doctors who reviewed grants, grant applications, and

19   provided recommendations for providing grants and

20   funds to those independent or outside researchers,

21    correct?

22        A.   That's true.

23        Q.   Okay. You have been a member of a similar

24   organization, a medical review board, a Medical

25   Advisory Board for the FAMRI, the flight attendants 4878

1    organization that you referenced, correct?

2        A.   The Flight Attendant Medical Research

3   Institute, yes.

4        Q.   That organization, just like the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=444
5   Scientific Advisory Board, reviews grants, considers

6   those that are appropriate to the mission of FAMRI

7   and issues recommendations for approval of the grant

8   applications to the Board of Directors of FAMRI,

9   correct?

10        A.   Yes. I also do it for the American Cancer

11    Society, the National Cancer Institute.

12        Q.   Let's stick with FAMRI for the moment.

13        A.   Sure. FAMRI--actually, you know, my job

14   in FAMRI, when I was on the Medical Advisory Board,

15   they don't actually review the grants, we set up the

16   review process where we had a company come in that

17   handles the same reviews that is done for the

18   Department of Defense for their grant program and

19   they have experts in different areas that are

20   identified to come in and do the peer review.

21         Q.   For FAMRI, when you were on the Medical

22   Advisory Board, the recommendations that you made

23   went up to a Board of Directors who had final

24   approval for issuing any grants from the

25   organization, correct? 4879

1        A.   That's true.

2        Q.   Among the Board of Directors for FAMRI at

3   the time you were on the medical review board from

4   2003 to 2007 were several lawyers, correct?

5        A.   On the Board of Directors or the Medical

6   Advisory Board?

7        Q.   Board of Directors.

8        A.   Board of Directors had lawyers. The

9   Medical Advisory Board were scientists, like Julius

10   Richmond, former Surgeon General, was the chair of

11    that board, Medical Advisory Board that I served on.

12        Q.   And according to the website for FAMRI,

13   the Board of Directors has the final say in

14   approving the grants, correct?

15        A.   That's true, that's the way the

16   organization was incorporated under agreement,

17   because that was actually set up as a result of the

18   lawsuit.

19        Q.   Right. And that was another example of

20   funding provided by the tobacco industry as a result

21    of a lawsuit which was settled, correct?

22        A.   That's right.

23        Q.   New topic, Dr. Cummings.

24        A.   Okay.

25        Q.   If I can get the right reference here. 4880

1   And I want to ask you whether or not, in 1997 or

2    1998, you think it would have been reasonable to

3   indicate to people who were attempting or thinking

4   about stopping smoking, just thinking about it, to

5   tell them that it's not hard to stop smoking?

6        A.   Would I say that? No, but others may say

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=445
7   that.

8        Q.   All right. In 1997 -

9        A.   And it would depend, I would have to --

10   somebody that doesn't smoke on a daily basis, it's

11   probably not so hard to stop smoking.

12        Q.   It depends on the context in which that

13   statement is made, correct?

14        A.   True.

15        Q.   So when you --

16             This is, your Honor, I think you have a

17   copy up there, "Smart Move," and that's number what,

18   Dr. Cummings?

19        A.   AN000133.

20        Q.   Okay. This is a publication that you put

21    together.

22             Well, let me use the ELMO, if I can,

23   your Honor.

24             I got a better copy, a color copy that

25   might be easier to see. 4881

1        A.   Oh, great.

2        Q.   Okay. The pamphlet that you helped put

3   together as a result of the work that you have done

4   at your cessation clinic in New York. This is 1997

5   publication, correct?

6        A.   It was reprinted a few times. I wrote it

7   in the early '90s.

8        Q.   Early '90s, all right. And one of the

9   things that you included in your pamphlet were

10   testimonials?

11         A.   That's right.

12        Q.   Like we see on the first page here. "I

13   always thought it would be impossible to stop.

14   Anyone can do it, if they set their mind to it. A

15   positive attitude is important," correct?

16        A.   That's correct.

17        Q.   You don't start off the brochure telling

18   people that smoking is an addiction, like heroin and

19   cocaine, and it can be very, very, very hard to

20   quit, do you?

21         A.   No, that's not at the start, that's where

22   we talk about the topic of nicotine addiction a

23   little later in the pamphlet.

24        Q.   Right. The beginning information is

25   encouraging, correct? 4882

1        A.   Well, we hope that the entire guide is

2   encouraging. We're trying to help people quit

3   smoking.

4        Q.   Right. So to do that, statements like,

5    "it's not hard to stop smoking," are made, correct?

6        A.   These are quotes from people who had gone

7   through my clinic. I don't know who the pictures

8   are because the Cancer Society that printed the

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=446
9   brochure came up with stock photos, but the quotes

10   actually did come from people from our clinic, some

11    of whom I've stayed in touch with, some of whom

12   relapsed back to smoking after they had given us

13   those clips.

14        Q.   Peggy M., a former

15   one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker, regarding that

16   testimonial that she was concerned that it would be

17   hard, but it turned out not to be for her, correct?

18        A.   That's right.

19        Q.   In 1992, would it be accurate to say that

20   cigarette smoking is only strongly linked with

21    emphysema and chronic bronchitis instead of saying

22   cigarette smoking causes emphysema and chronic

23   bronchitis?

24        A.   Well, it causes emphysema and chronic

25   bronchitis. 4883

1         Q.   Would it be a misrepresentation to say it

2   was only strongly linked and not causally connected?

3        A.   It was probably a way of, you know, giving

4   a layman's understanding of that association. So it

5   says cigarette smoking is strongly linked with

6   emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In fact, there's

7   a whole list of things that we talk about under,

8   don't wait until it's too late.

9        Q.   All right. So if cigarette smoking is

10   strongly linked with emphysema and chronic

11   bronchitis, it means the same thing as cause?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   In 1979, among the medical scientific

14   community, was there any confusion about the link

15   between cigarette smoking and lung cancer in women?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   For how long a period of time had there

18   been no confusion about the link between cigarette

19   smoking and lung cancer in women?

20        A.   Well, 1958, it was general agreement among

21    the scientific community, particularly even in the

22   industry and members of the Tobacco Industry

23   Research Committee, other research scientists, that

24   cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer. The

25   magnitude of that association, I think, was yet 4884

1    something that was still being determined.

2        Q.   If Dr. Burns indicated that there was

3   confusion on that point in the 1970s, you disagree

4   with that?

5             MR. SCAROLA: Objection, your Honor,

6        that's an improper form and argumentative.

7             THE COURT: Sustained.

8     BY MR. KELLY:

9        Q.   When did the Surgeon General report on the

10   causal connection between cigarette smoking and lung

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=447
11    cancer in women?

12        A.   In women, there was an entire report, I

13   believe --

14        Q.   Correct.

15        A.   -- in 1985 that was devoted to the health

16   effects of smoking in women. But before then, they

17   certainly talked about cigarette smoking as a cause

18   of lung cancer in men and women.

19        Q.   You certainly wouldn't characterize it as

20   any confusion on the topic in the 1970s, correct?

21         A.   I wouldn't say there was confusion. The

22   magnitude of association, perhaps, was not as fully

23   determined, particularly since there were different

24   pathologies, particularly adenocarcinoma was not as

25   well-established. Squamous cell carcinoma of the 4885

1   lung was very well-established as causally linked to

2   cigarette smoking early on.

3        Q.   Let me ask you a couple of questions, new

4   topic, Dr. Cummings.

5        A.   Sure.

6        Q.   Denicotinized cigarettes, cigarettes from

7   which the nicotine has been removed. In the '50s,

8   there were products available that had lower

9   nicotine than others and were marketed as such, like

10   Sano, that you referenced a little bit ago this

11    afternoon, right?

12        A.   That's right. I think we even saw an ad

13   for Camels at 28 percent less nicotine.

14        Q.   Philip Morris, you're aware, put on the

15   market cigarettes that had so little nicotine in

16   them that they were not measurable by the technology

17   used by the FTC method to measure nicotine, correct?

18        A.   Are you referring to the Next cigarette --

19        Q.   Next.

20        A.   - or Benson & Hedges DeNic?

21         Q.   That's exactly right.

22        A.   Well, they were put in test markets.

23        Q.   Let's just talk about what they were

24   first.

25        A.   Sure. 4886

1         Q.   They were cigarettes that Philip Morris

2   had manufactured that had so little nicotine in them

3   that they were not able to measure them using the

4   technology for the FTC method, correct?

5        A.   That's right.

6        Q.   They had to develop new methodology to get

7   some measurement so that they could comply with the

8   FTC method; were you aware of that?

9        A.   I was, because I read the documents on the

10   development of the cigarette, the artificially

11   produced tobacco, or project ART.

12        Q.   Philip Morris bought a coffee company to

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=448
13   obtain the decaffeinated process that the coffee

14   company used so they could apply it to tobacco,

15   correct?

16        A.   They brought General Foods.

17        Q.   Which had a coffee company that had a

18   patented system for decaffeinated coffee that was

19   used for the development of these cigarettes,

20   correct?

21         A.   Sanka, yes.

22        Q.   And Philip Morris built an entire

23   manufacturing plant for the development of these

24   denicotinized cigarettes for -- that they were going

25   to market as Next and under the Benson & Hedges 4887

1   brand family as well, correct?

2        A.   They were testing different -- a line

3   extension marketing plan versus a new brand called

4   Next, and that was the purpose of doing that.

5        Q.   They did both of those things, didn't

6   they?

7        A.   As part of the market test, yes.

8        Q.   That's right. And part of the marketing

9   plan was to put those cigarettes into markets with

10   brand promotions to the retailers, giving them

11    monetary incentives to push those products into the

12   marketplace so that customers would try them,

13   correct?

14        A.   That's right, and they did that.

15        Q.   And they did that, and they had a little

16   bit of market share for a period of time when they

17   did that, correct?

18        A.   About 1 to 2 percent.

19        Q.   Right. And as soon as they withdrew the

20   incentives and the promotions, nobody wanted to buy

21    and smoke those cigarettes, correct?

22        A.   Well, what they found was the trial to

23   adoption ratio was low for the denicotinized

24   cigarettes, particularly since the availability of

25   nicotine-containing cigarettes were there and 4888

1    smokers migrated back to those.

2        Q.   And that's consistent with what the 1964

3   Surgeon General's report indicated with respect to

4   the low nicotine cigarettes that had been on the

5   market before in the '50s, that they were not

6   popular with people who smoked, correct?

7        A.   They were very different products, so it

8   was inconsistent with what the Surgeon General's

9   report was talking about in 1964, and it really

10   wasn't a test of what would happen because the

11   product was withdrawn by Philip Morris in those test

12   markets and it was never made available on a

13   national basis.

14        Q.   It went into warehouses because nobody

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=449
15   would buy them until a researcher named Dr. Benowitz

16   needed denicotinized cigarettes for part of his

17   research plan, a project out in San Francisco; were

18   you aware of that?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   Philip Morris gave Dr. Benowitz the

21    denicotinized cigarettes that had been in storage

22   for some time for that project?

23        A.   Frozen, yes.

24        Q.   That's how they store them, right?

25        A.   That's right. I have over 40,000 packs in 4889

1    our storage container for the lab that we run,

2   that's how we store them and they are frozen.

3        Q.   Let's get back to talking about the

4   denicotinized cigarette that Philip Morris made

5   available to Dr. Benowitz for his research project.

6        A.   Okay.

7        Q.   Are you aware that the public health

8   community criticized Philip Morris for attempting to

9   sell cigarettes that did not provide nicotine, but

10   provided tar?

11         A.   Who, in the public health community, are

12   you referring to?

13        Q.   In the media and the public health

14   community, are you aware of anybody criticizing the

15   company for attempting to sell denicotinized

16   cigarettes?

17        A.   I'm not disputing the fact that somebody,

18   somewhere may have criticized the company for doing

19   that, but I would not characterize that as a

20   criticism of the public health community.

21         Q.   Are you aware of any public health

22   organization coming to support Philip Morris'

23   efforts to sell denicotinized cigarettes?

24        A.   I would. I've been testifying about it

25   for a long time --4890

1         Q.    entire organization --

2        A.   I know a lot of people who think that if

3   you're going to sell combustion tobacco products,

4   you should do it with, you know, very little

5   nicotine, so people have a choice.

6        Q.   When Philip Morris actually attempted to

7   do that, are you aware of anybody in the public

8   health community that publicly came out and

9   supported Philip Morris' efforts? Is that a no?

10        A.   I'm not aware of anybody supporting or

11    refuting.

12        Q.   When you were involved in the seminar put

13   on by the media consultants where you learned about

14   creating controversy, do you recall that testimony?

15        A.   I attended a workshop that was run at the

16   National Cancer Institute in the late 1980s about

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=450
17   basically how to do public relations around getting

18   the message out about the health risks of smoking.

19        Q.   Right. And one of the examples of

20   creating controversy that you gave was documenting

21    the sale of cigarettes in a store in a retail outlet

22   to underage smokers. Do you recall that?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   Are you familiar with Philip Morris'

25   sponsored program called, "We Card"? 4891

1        A.   I am.

2        Q.   And the efforts of Philip Morris to get

3   legislatures around the country to make it illegal

4   to sell cigarettes to underage smokers?

5             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, may we establish

6        a time frame with regard to these activities.

7             MR. KELLY: Sure. Thank you, Counsel.

8     BY MR. KELLY:

9        Q.   In the We Card program in the '90s, are

10   you familiar with that?

11         A.   Late '90s, yes.

12        Q.   Mid to late'90s?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   The We Card program was a program that was

15   imposed on retailers. Retailers are independent

16   from the tobacco company in that they're independent

17   businesses, correct?

18        A.   They have contracts with the cigarette

19   manufacturers for things like the power wall we

20   talked about.

21         Q.   That's right. And We Card is a program by

22   which the retailer has to commit to not selling

23   cigarettes to underage smokers and verifying --

24             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor. May

25        we approach the bench, please? 4892

1              THE COURT: Yes.

2             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

3        held out of the presence of the jury:)

4             MR. SCAROLA: Clearly this can have no

5        nexus to Charlie Piendle, and I would not raise

6        that objection, except that I note what the

7        time is. These are all matters counsel can get

8        into at a later time. I don't think it's

9        appropriate now, and I do need some time for

10        redirect examination.

11              MR. KELLY: I'll move this pretty quick.

12             MR. SCAROLA: How about not at all?

13             MR. KELLY: It came up today. He's

14        leaving.

15             THE COURT: How much longer do you think

16        you are on cross?

17             MR. KELLY: Probably 5:15. I'm looking at

18        5:15.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=451
19             THE COURT: We're trying to get redirect

20        by 5:30.

21              MR. KELLY: I have a lot to cover.

22             MR. SCAROLA: There's uncontested facts

23        that don't need to be established through this

24        witness. There are other witnesses that can

25        testify to these matters. 4893

1              MR. KELLY: We'd be done by now. Sure.

2             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

3        concluded and the following proceedings were

4        held within the presence of the jury:)

5             MR. KELLY: I'll move on, your Honor.

6     BY MR. KELLY:

7        Q.   To the YSP program that you talked about

8   on direct examination, Dr. Cummings, do you recall

9   that?

10        A.   Sure. You mean the pamphlet?

11         Q.   I do.

12             MR. KELLY: Excuse me, your Honor.

13             MR. SCAROLA: If we're taking time to get

14        me a copy, I don't need one, your Honor.

15             MR. KELLY: Well, we're taking time to

16        move through things I'm not going to be

17        covering.

18             MR. SCAROLA: That, I need.

19             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, may I have the

20        defendants' next in order, please?

21              THE COURT: I.D.?

22             MR. KELLY: I.D., please, your Honor.

23             THE COURT: B.

24             MR. KELLY: May I, your Honor?

25             THE COURT: Yes. 4894

1     BY MR. KELLY:

2        Q.   Dr. Cummings, you indicated on direct

3   examination that in the year 2000, over a decade

4   ago, Philip Morris made a public statement that

5   cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and other

6   diseases, correct?

7        A.   That's correct.

8        Q.   And that cigarette smoking is addictive,

9   correct?

10        A.   Correct.

11         Q.   And that's been the consistent position of

12   Philip Morris for the last decade, correct?

13        A.   Since November of 2000, as I recall, yes.

14        Q.   A little over a decade, then?

15        A.   Yep.

16             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'd like to

17        publish --

18             MR. SCAROLA: No objection.

19     BY MR. KELLY:

20        Q.   This was published on the website, it was

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^^pgNbr=452
21    also published in other media, as you recall,

22   Dr. Cummings, magazines and newspapers?

23        A.   Correct.

24        Q.   It indicates that, "Philip Morris USA

25   takes the position that there is no safe cigarette. 4895

1   Philip Morris USA agrees with the overwhelming

2   medical and scientific consensus that cigarette

3   smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,

4   emphysema, and every serious diseases in smokers.

5   Smokers are far more likely to develop such serious

6   diseases than nonsmokers. These have been and

7   continue to be the messages of the U.S. Surgeon

8   General and public health authorities worldwide.

9   Smokers and potential smokers should rely on these

10   messages when deciding whether or not to smoke."

11              Just an excerpt from the public statement

12   on the website, correct?

13        A.   That's from the website, yes, not

14   necessarily the ads, but yes.

15             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'd like to

16        publish C.

17             MR. SCAROLA: No objection.

18             MR. KELLY: Thank you, Counsel.

19     BY MR. KELLY:

20        Q.   Same website with respect to addiction,

21    "For the last decade, Philip Morris USA has agreed

22   with the overwhelming medical and scientific

23   consensus that cigarette smoking is addictive. It

24   can be very difficult to quit smoking, but this

25   should not deter smokers who want to quit from 4896

1   trying to do so," correct?

2        A.   That's what it says. It does deter them.

3   If you're addicted, it's hard to quit.

4        Q.   Yes, but it can be very difficult to quit

5   smoking, but the fact that it can be very difficult

6   should not deter people from trying.

7        A.   That's true.

8        Q.   You would agree with that?

9        A.   And as I think I testified, 96 percent of

10   the smokers had tried in the cohort that we

11    followed. So there's a lot of motivation to quit

12   and people have a hard time staying off.

13        Q.   "In addition to taking that position in

14   the year 2000, Philip Morris, as part of its

15   commitment to the attorneys general as part of the

16   settlement agreement in 1998, set up a youth smoking

17   prevention program inside the company." Do you

18   recall that?

19        A.   I was not part of the master settlement.

20   But Philip Morris chose to do that and I believe it

21    was set up, yes, in 1998.

22        Q.   You don't recall the Florida settlement

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=453
23   agreement required the companies to identify the

24   youth smoking prevention coordinator inside the

25   company? 4897

1        A.   I don't recall. Florida was a separate

2   agreement and I'm not familiar with the nuances of

3   that specific agreement.

4        Q.   Philip Morris did set up a youth smoking

5   prevention department in the corporation dating back

6   to 1998, right?

7        A.   Right. Carol Levy was the first director

8   and she came and met with me to gather information

9   because she claims she had no knowledge of what to

10   do.

11              MR. KELLY: Move to strike, your Honor, as

12        nonresponsive.

13             THE COURT: I will grant the motion to

14        strike that portion of the testimony.

15     BY MR. KELLY:

16        Q.   In 2003, the publication that you showed

17   the jury was put out by the Philip Morris YSP

18   program, correct?

19        A.   This is a 2003 document, yes.

20        Q.   Right.

21              Your Honor, I'm going to publish to the

22   jury the --1 think this is in evidence. Counsel?

23             The youth smoking prevention department,

24   Philip Morris had an advisory board for

25   consultation, correct? 4898

1        A.   For this particular pamphlet, yes.

2        Q.   Among them were physicians from Harvard,

3   University of South Carolina, Dr. Littmann and

4   others, correct?

5        A.   That's right.

6        Q.   The pamphlet was put together as a guide

7   for parents to talk to their children about the

8   risks of smoking, correct?

9        A.   Correct.

10        Q.   Gave them -- we don't have time to go

11    through all of it, it's in evidence, so let me see

12   if we can, between the two of us, summarize some of

13   it.

14        A.   Sure.

15        Q.   It provided the parents with advice about

16   how to start talking to their children about smoking

17   and tips on how to inquire about whether their

18   children are smoking or aren't, correct?

19        A.   Whether they're addicted and the risks

20   associated with starting to smoke at an early age

21   being associated with a greater propensity to be

22   addicted, and then acknowledging that, you know, you

23   should share the fact that you would have made a

24   different decision had you known now what you --

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=454
25   what had been available earlier. 4899

1         Q.   It talks about peer pressure and how to

2   deal with peer pressure?

3        A.   Among other things.

4        Q.   It provides contact information --

5             MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

6        Pardon me, I'm sorry. This is a document that

7        is in evidence, it speaks for itself, and

8        particularly in light of the hour and the fact

9        that this witness is not permitted to interpret

10        its meaning in any way, I would ask that

11         counsel be restricted and move on.

12             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I've been up here,

13        I don't know, 45 minutes, after counsel spent

14        almost two days with this witness. I would

15        request counsel stop interrupting me to try and

16        move me along so he can get up and talk some

17        more.

18             MR. SCAROLA: I am only asking,

19        your Honor, that the time be used efficiently

20        in light of the hour, and this is entirely

21         unnecessary.

22             THE COURT: Let me hear what the next

23        question is.

24             MR. KELLY: Your Honor -

25             THE COURT: You can --4900

1              MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I object to

2        counsel commenting upon my questions in front

3        of the jury. It is entirely unnecessary --

4             THE COURT: I don't -

5             MR. KELLY: --1 did not bring this up --

6             THE COURT: Okay. You may ask -

7             MR. KELLY: -- counsel brought it up.

8             THE COURT: You may ask the next question.

9     BY MR. KELLY:

10        Q.   The pamphlet for the parents provided

11    resource and contact information for the parents if

12   they wanted further information, correct?

13        A.   That's true.

14        Q.   It provided tips on how to keep the lines

15   of communication open with your children?

16             MR. SCAROLA: Same objection, your Honor.

17             THE COURT: Overruled.

18        A.   Yes.

19     BY MR. KELLY:

20        Q.   It gave tips on what to do if you suspect

21    your child smokes, correct?

22        A.   Correct.

23        Q.   And it addresses specifically what to do

24   if you yourself smoke because of the risk that your

25   child may follow suit, correct? 4901

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=455
1        A.   It does talk -- it talks to parents, if

2   they smoke, how to talk to your kids.

3        Q.   All right. This is only one of the

4   publications that the YSP, the Youth Smoking

5   Prevention Program at Philip Morris put out,

6   correct?

7        A.   That's right.

8        Q.   They put out television commercials, and a

9   couple of different programs designed to address the

10   youth smoking prevention issue, correct?

11         A.   It ran during a brief period of time some

12   public service ads. They also ran some newspaper

13   ads.

14        Q.   And they have also worked with

15   legislatures around the country to enact legislation

16   to prevent or to make illegal selling cigarettes to

17   underage smokers, correct?

18        A.   Well, they haven't opposed that effort in

19   any legislation recently. Prior to that there had

20   been opposition.

21         Q.   In the last decade, they have actively

22   promoted that legislation, haven't they?

23        A.   In the last decade, they have encouraged

24   legislatures to enforce and, you know, have a legal

25   age of -- for sale to 18 and older. 4902

1         Q.   And to remove all self-service machines in

2   stores, correct?

3        A.   That is actually a requirement of the --

4   of a recently passed 2009 FDA law.

5        Q.   For the past decade, though, Philip Morris

6   has been requiring its retail outlets to remove all

7   self-service machines, correct?

8        A.   I'm not familiar with whether that, you

9   know, has been the position. I know that we tried

10   to get a self-service law passed in the 1990s, and

11    it was opposed by Philip Morris.

12             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I have what has

13        been marked in evidence as plaintiffs 116 and

14         113, and I think I only have one copy, so I'm

15        going to show the witness this copy,

16        your Honor.

17     BY MR. KELLY:

18        Q.   I'm turning, Dr. Cummings, to what is

19   page 10 for reference for the record with that.

20   Take a look at the date on that, please. 116 is

21    dated what?

22        A.   December 31, 1956.

23        Q.   And 113 is 1957, correct? I have 113 in

24   my hand right here.

25        A.   Okay. 1957. 4903

1         Q.   I'll give you both.

2        A.   All right.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=456
3        Q.   And here is what I want to ask you about.

4             In the early 1950s, Marlboro was a ladies'

5   brand, correct?

6        A.   That's right.

7        Q.   And it transitioned into a male-directed

8   brand from the mid-'50s on, correct?

9        A.   1954.

10        Q.   And through the balance of the '50s, the

11    marketing campaign for Marlboros was called the

12   tattoo. Do you recall that?

13        A.   I recall those series of ads with sort of

14   a macho guy with a tattoo.

15        Q.   Do you see examples of the macho guy in

16   various of the pictures in the exhibits? And

17   usually he's got his fist somewhere prominent in the

18   picture so you can see the tattoo on the back of his

19   hand.

20        A.   Yes.

21         Q.   In both of those, you can see that?

22        A.   It's hard to see, given the -- but I've

23   seen the colored ads, and, yes, those are examples

24   of ads that I've seen from this period.

25        Q.   Those would be within the marketing 4904

1   program called the tattoo ads?

2        A.   There are other versions of ads that were

3   run at the same period. This was one of the

4   campaigns. There were a variety of themes that were

5   used by Philip Morris for marketing Marlboro

6   cigarettes during this time period.

7        Q.   And what's become known as the Marlboro

8   Country or the Marlboro Cowboy ads emerged in the

9   early 1960s?

10        A.   1962.

11         Q.   Thank you.

12             THE COURT: Can I have counsel approach

13        for a quick second?

14             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

15        held out of the presence of the jury:)

16             THE COURT: I just want to ask, if we're

17        not going to finish, I didn't want to have him

18        miss his plane. What do you all want to do?

19             MR. SCAROLA: Try and finish.

20             THE COURT: I don't want to rush anyone.

21         I just wanted to ask.

22             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

23        concluded and the following proceedings were

24        held within the presence of the jury:)

25             MR. KELLY: My target is 5:15. 4905

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, if I could just

3        take a moment and look at my notes and see if

4        there's anything else I need to cover with

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=457
5        Dr. Cummings.

6             THE COURT: Okay.

7             MR. KELLY: Thank you.

8             MR. SCAROLA: I'd be happy to fill the

9        void.

10             MR. KELLY: I know, it's like a vacuum.

11         It naturally wants to be filled up. The

12        silence should be refreshing, I think.

13             THE WITNESS: It's putting me to sleep.

14             JUROR VERBOOM: Excuse me one second.

15             MR. KELLY: That would be great. And give

16        me a chance to check my notes.

17             THE COURT: Why don't we open it for

18        members of the jury to use the restroom and

19        counsel if you need to.

20             MR. KELLY: Thank you very much.

21              THE COURT: If other jurors want to stand

22        up and stretch and use the restroom as well or

23        counsel.

24             (Thereupon, a recess was taken from

25        5:08 p.m. until 5:09 p.m., after which the 4906

1        following proceedings were held:)

2             THE COURT: Anything further from counsel?

3        Anything further?

4             MR. KELLY: Yes, your Honor. I'm flipping

5        through a document if I can find it among the

6        ones with Dr. Cummings.

7             I got it, your Honor.

8     BY MR. KELLY:

9        Q.   Couple of other questions Dr. Cummings.

10             The ad, the televised ad that you showed

11    with Julie London singing in the darkened bar or

12   restaurant, sitting at the table --

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   -- was in the early '50s, did you say?

15        A.   No.

16        Q.   What did you say?

17        A.   1950s.

18        Q.   What did you say?

19        A.   1950s. It was in that decade.

20        Q.   You can't be more precise than that?

21         A.   I believe it was the 1950s. I can't be

22   precise about the date.

23        Q.   All right. So you don't know if it

24   predated the tattoo branding program?

25        A.   No, I don't. 4907

1         Q.   All right. Is it -- is it -- how old do

2   you think the guy was that was sitting at the table

3   with her?

4             MR. SCAROLA: Objection, calls for an

5        opinion, your Honor, about the meaning or

6        interpretation of the advertisement.

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=458
7             MR. KELLY: Can we strike every opinion

8        he's had, your Honor? That might make it

9        easier.

10             THE COURT: If you can answer the question

11         without interpreting a document. If you can't,

12        just indicate you cannot.

13        A.   I cannot.

14     BY MR. KELLY:

15        Q.   An older guy?

16        A.   He was an older guy. He wasn't a

17   teenager.

18        Q.   Is it your opinion that the Julie London

19   ad singing the Marlboro song in the darkened bar in

20   the 1950s was an attempt to appeal to underage

21    smokers?

22        A.   I wouldn't say that, no.

23        Q.   New topic, second-to-last topic. Press

24   releases. You talked about press releasees from The

25   Tobacco Institute. You're familiar with press 4908

1   releases both with respect to The Tobacco Institute,

2   and in your own experience, putting out press

3   releases for your organization, correct?

4        A.   Correct. I have selected many thousands

5   of press releases from -- archived from The Tobacco

6   Institute that was turned over to me, and I --

7   certainly my own institution have written press

8   releases and such.

9        Q.   Right. Here's how a press release works.

10   A company sends out a press release, and the media

11    outlet, whether it's a newspaper or radio or

12   television or magazine, then makes a decision which

13   part of the press release, if any, to put into their

14   publication or put on the air, correct?

15        A.   Or to call up the contact person and

16   interview them about the content of the press

17   release.

18        Q.   Right. Have you made any systematic

19   review of the press releases you showed the jury to

20   see if they were picked up and published in total or

21    in part by any newspaper anywhere Mr. Piendle was?

22        A.   I have made a study of the press release

23   from the 1988 Surgeon General's report as to its

24   coverage because the -- somebody from The Tobacco

25   Institute appeared on the national news media, plus 4909

1    a local news media. In fact, Brendan Moran and

2   Walker Merryman appeared in the same TV show.

3   Again, I collected the archive. It was a videotape.

4   I didn't bring the videotape. I only shared the

5   press release.

6        Q.   Other than the 1988 press release, have

7   you made any systematic review to see whether any of

8   the other press releases you brought with you to

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=459
9   show the jury were picked up and any part of them

10   published in a newspaper or a magazine where

11    Mr. Piendle was?

12        A.   Well, I know other than that 1988 one, I

13   think that was the only press release that I brought

14   and showed to the jury. I brought a number of clips

15   of national news shows, and certainly they were

16   national and would have -- would have appeared

17   widely and all over the United States, including

18   where Mr. Piendle lived.

19        Q.   You have lots of press releases in your

20   archives, right?

21         A.   Thousands.

22        Q.   Have you made any systematic review of any

23   of those press releases, other than 1988 press

24   release, to see whether or not it was picked up and

25   published in a paper or a magazine in the vicinity 4910

1    of Mr. Piendle?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Which ones were published in the vicinity

4   of Mr. Piendle?

5        A.   Well, there were many that were published

6   in the New York Times, which is in the vicinity of

7   where he grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

8        Q.   When?

9        A.   Which press release are you referring to?

10   There are thousands, and I have looked at them, and

11    in fact, you see the press release, and then the

12   collection in the archive I have actually has the

13   press clippings from various newspapers.

14             I didn't in this particular case bring

15   with me those thousands of press releases to do that

16   study, but I am familiar, since you asked about any

17   of the ones that I brought with me and showed to the

18   jury, the one from 1988, because that's the one that

19   I brought with me to show the jury.

20        Q.   Did you bring any example --

21              MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, your Honor.

22        Pardon me.

23             THE COURT: Wait, wait.

24             MR. SCAROLA: I note that it is now two

25        minutes past 5:15, when counsel committed to 4911

1         complete his examination.

2             MR. KELLY: I'm going to ask for the

3        plaintiffs counsel leeway time, which is

4        usually about, you know, some period of time to

5        close, your Honor.

6             THE COURT: Let's me ask this. Mr. Tyson,

7        is 5:30 a drop dead time, or would a phone call

8        allow any flexibility?

9             JUROR TYSON: Not the school.

10             THE COURT: Is there anyone else who can

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=460
11         assist?

12             JUROR TYSON: My wife is working until

13        6:30.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I will commit to finish in

15         15 minutes.

16             MR. KELLY: Then I will wrap this up.

17     BY MR. KELLY:

18        Q.   You did not bring any examples of any

19   newspapers in the vicinity of Mr. Piendle showing

20   press releases from The Tobacco Institute, did you?

21         A.   Other than the one I mentioned, no.

22        Q.   The May 1988?

23        A.   That's right.

24        Q.   All right. The Dr. Dunn speech. Let me

25   see if you agree with this chronology of events with 4912

1   respect to the Dr. Dunn speech, Dr. Cummings.

2        A.   Sure.

3        Q.   In 1972, there was a conference in the

4   Caribbean sponsored by CTR and attended by

5   academicians, scientists, sociologists, and others

6   presenting papers on the issue of why people smoke.

7   Do you recall that?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   As a result of -- at that conference,

10   papers were presented, correct?

11         A.   That's right.

12        Q.   In October of that year at the CORESTA

13   Conference of Tobacco Researchers and Scientists,

14   Dr. Dunn gave a speech about the conference he had

15   attended and participated in, correct?

16        A.   That's right.

17        Q.   And then following that speech, in October

18   of 1972, a newspaper report of that conference, the

19   CORESTA Conference was published in the local area

20   down in Virginia, correct?

21         A.   No, it was in Richmond, Virginia, and it

22   wasn't about the conference, it was about Dr. Dunn's

23   speech.

24        Q.   At the conference?

25        A.   That's right. 4913

1         Q.   And then in 1973, the beginning of 1973,

2   Dr. Dunn's book was published, correct?

3        A.   The proceedings were published, that's

4   correct.

5        Q.   That he edited?

6        A.   He was the editor of.

7        Q.   All right. The initial conference in

8   January 1972 was open to the public, correct?

9        A.   You have to be a member of CORESTA to

10   attend.

11         Q.   The CTR-sponsored conference in the

12   Caribbean was open to the public, correct?

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=461
13        A.   No. That was an invited -- experts were

14   invited to attend that conference to give their

15   papers and to share their views on the topic.

16        Q.   All right. It was not limited to tobacco

17   industry scientists, correct?

18        A.   That's correct.

19        Q.   The CORESTA Conference was scientists from

20   around the world, correct?

21         A.   That's right.

22             MR. SCAROLA: Your Honor, I am prepared to

23        stipulate to all of these facts.

24             THE COURT: Can we approach for one

25        second. 4914

1              (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

2        held out of the presence of the jury:)

3             THE COURT: I think we just may need to

4        bring him back. Here's what I don't want to

5        have happen: Mr. Kelly is rushing, and we've

6        got to get redirect and don't finish, so we

7        trickle it over. I don't want there to be

8        unfair prejudice to either side.

9             MR. SCAROLA: I'll stipulate -

10             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

11         concluded and the following proceedings were

12        held within the presence of the jury:)

13             MR. KELLY: Especially with a stipulation,

14        your Honor.

15             Thank you for hurrying through it with me,

16        Dr. Cummings. Thank you.

17             THE COURT: Redirect.

18                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   Dr. Cummings, we're going to sprint again,

21    sir. The point was made that you have not

22   personally examined all 16 million pages of the

23   documents available to you. Every one of these

24    16 million pages you told us is posted online,

25   cataloged and searchable, word searchable format, 4915

1    correct?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Is that entire bank of documents available

4   to Mr. Kelly and Mr. Biersteker and everybody else

5   on this defense team?

6        A.   Yes, the 16 million pages, along with the

7   additional 60 million.

8        Q.   Has it been available to all of those

9   other lawyers who have represented tobacco in all of

10   those other cases in which you've been giving

11    testimony and been subject to cross-examination?

12        A.   Yes.

13        Q.   They had an opportunity to pull out any of

14   those pages that they thought contradicted your

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=462
15   testimony in any way every time you've been

16   cross-examined, correct?

17        A.   Yes, they did.

18        Q.   And what they came up with was

19   Exhibit AN2743. This document, and I don't know

20   whether it's been admitted, but if it hasn't been

21    admitted, I would move the Defense Exhibit AN2743

22   into evidence.

23             This is the one that talks about the

24   Legler report, the poll that Legler did, right?

25             THE COURT: AN2743? 4916

1              MR. SCAROLA: AN2743.

2             THE COURT: Any objection?

3             MR. BIERSTEKER: No, your Honor.

4             MR. KELLY: No, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Admitted without objection.

6     BY MR. SCAROLA:

7        Q.   Mr. Henry Legler was from an ad agency

8   called Warwick & Legler, right?

9        A.   That's right.

10        Q.   Mr. Legler didn't get the job to write the

11    Frank Statement, correct?

12        A.   Correct.

13        Q.   And he was writing complaining about the

14   Frank Statement saying, you made a mistake, the ad

15   agency, Hill & Knowlton, Inc., who actually did the

16   Frank Statement, he's telling them, you screwed up,

17   and the proof that you screwed up is I did this

18   survey, I'm not telling you who I asked or what the

19   questions were, but the survey --

20             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is very

21         argumentative.

22     BY MR. SCAROLA:

23        Q.   It is. I'm rushing through it. The point

24   is the survey was conducted by a competitor of the

25   people who wrote the Frank Statement, correct? 4917

1        A.   A competitor of Hill & Knowlton, right.

2        Q.   Yes. And what they said was Legler's

3   thinking on this was whether a carcinogenic agent or

4   any other deleterious element in tobacco, if

5   isolated, could ever be removed to the satisfaction

6   of the medical profession.

7             He said Henry Legler had criticisms of the

8   January 4 ad, felt that the copy should have been

9   toned down with special regard to the statement that

10   the companies do not believe their products are

11    injurious to health. This, he said, sounded

12   ridiculous. That's what Mr. Legler said.

13        A.   That's correct.

14        Q.   And that's the document that they contend

15   impeaches your opinion, correct?

16             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, it's very

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20T^pgNbr=463
17        argumentative.

18             THE COURT: Sustained.

19     BY MR. SCAROLA:

20        Q.   You were asked a number of questions about

21    all the wonderful things that cigarette companies

22   have done over the course of the last decade. The

23   cigarette companies were required, through

24   litigation settlements, to undertake smoking

25   prevention and cessation programs during the past 4918

1    decade, correct?

2        A.   That's right.

3        Q.   Those were not voluntary efforts on the

4   part of the cigarette companies, they arose out of

5   lawsuits, right?

6        A.   That's correct.

7        Q.   The Marlboro Man you told us became a

8   regular fixture of ads in 1962, however, we know

9   from the annual report sitting there right in front

10   of you that they began to use a cowboy theme with

11    men wearing cowboy hats who evolved into the

12   Marlboro Man back in 1954, correct?

13        A.   That's true.

14        Q.   And those pictures are right in those

15   annual reports, aren't they?

16        A.   They are.

17        Q.   Thank you.

18             You were asked questions about teens using

19   marijuana and steroids and engaging in unprotected

20   sex on cross-examination. Do you remember that?

21         A.   Yes.

22        Q.   What, if any, impact would it have on

23   those high-risk behaviors if there was a national

24   campaign being conducted funded with tens or

25   hundreds of millions of dollars to encourage teens 4919

1   to smoke marijuana, to use steroids, and to engage

2   in unprotected sex?

3        A.   It would increase the likelihood that

4   those behaviors would happen.

5        Q.   And if there were corporations out there

6   who were paying sports figures and celebrities and

7   other heros to youth to tout the use of marijuana

8   and steroids and unprotected sex, what could we

9   reasonably anticipate from a public health

10   standpoint would occur with regard to the use and

11    engagement in those high-risk behaviors?

12        A.   Those high-risk behaviors would increase,

13   and it would be a public health disaster.

14        Q.   You were shown a 1994 Surgeon General's

15   report, read by defense counsel, and you said that

16   you disagreed with the statement in that 1994

17   Surgeon General's report. You asked counsel, "If

18   you'd like me to tell you why," and he said no. I

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20TestipgNbr=464
19   say yes. Tell us why, please.

20        A.   Well, the introduction of the advertising

21    for health themes for cigarettes, not a cough in a

22   carload and the filter themes, actually increased

23   dramatically the number of people smoking those

24   brands of cigarettes. So it had a very positive

25   effect. 4920

1              And the testimony that was given in

2   Congressional hearings in 1958, and again in 1967,

3   talked about the harmful effects of the advertising

4   of filtered cigarettes and later low-tar cigarettes

5   in promoting those brands. So that advertising

6   actually had a very detrimental effect.

7        Q.   You told us that it would be unreasonable

8   for tobacco companies to try to make marginal

9   improvements in the safety of cigarettes, and you

10   were not given an opportunity, although you asked

11    for one, to explain why. They said no, I say yes.

12   Tell us why, please.

13             MR. KELLY: Your Honor, that's

14        argumentative.

15             THE COURT: I'll sustain.

16     BY MR. SCAROLA:

17        Q.   Please tell us why it would be

18   unreasonable for tobacco companies to try to make

19   only marginal improvements in the safety of

20   cigarettes.

21         A.   Cigarettes deliver a massive amount of

22   poisonous chemicals, and simply playing around with

23   a chemical or two to try to reduce its levels would

24   have very little impact, if any, and it really

25   requires a dramatic change, remove the nicotine, you 4921

1    give people a choice, most people would choose not

2   to smoke, and that's been the experience that I

3   would suggest, is removing the nicotine from

4   combustion tobacco products, which would be a major

5   shift, and if combustion tobacco products took out

6   the one ingredient that is harmful, because it keeps

7   people exposing themselves repeatedly to all the

8   other poisons, which you remove one and another one

9   pops up, the only way to reduce the harm is to make

10   the product so it's not addictive.

11         Q.   There was a reference in cross-examination

12   to the 1950s Gallup Poll. Did that poll ask how

13   many smokers believed the industry's statements that

14   there was no evidence to link smoking with health

15   problems?

16        A.   That poll did not ask about belief, it

17   asked about awareness. The poll in 1953, Elmo

18   Roper, 10,000 people, commissioned by Philip Morris,

19   said that less than 1 percent of Americans saw a

20   link between smoking and cancer.

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=465
21         Q.   You recognize the man on the right?

22        A.   I do.

23        Q.   A lot of folks might disagree with his

24   politics, but you would agree that most people would

25   at least say he's a reasonable man? 4922

1        A.   That's right.

2        Q.   Do you agree that most people would

3   consider him to be a very intelligent person?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   And you know that he had been publicly

6   described on many, many occasions as a strong-willed

7   individual, correct?

8        A.   That's correct.

9        Q.   And you also know that President Barack

10   Obama was and remains addicted to nicotine despite

11    what he himself has described as the strongest

12   possible motivation to try to break that habit; is

13   that right?

14        A.   That's right.

15        Q.   He's 48 years old, born in 1961, correct?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   All right, sir. Last question, and you

18   have one minute to answer.

19             You're described as a general in the

20   anti-smoking campaign. Why have you taken a

21    leadership role in the anti-smoking campaign,

22   Dr. Cummings?

23        A.   I've taken a leadership role in the

24   anti-smoking campaign because cigarettes kill more

25   Americans than all other things, drugs, alcohol, 4923

1    cocaine, accidents, fires, combined. I work at a

2   cancer center. One-third of the patients in our

3   cancer center are there because of smoking.

4             Over 90 percent of lung cancers are due to

5   smoking, and it's the one thing that if we could

6   reduce the amount of smoking that we have in this

7   country, it would make a massive difference for

8   people's health and for the families who were

9   affected by the harm that's caused by tobacco use.

10        Q.   Dr. Cummings, thank you very much, sir. I

11   just have one last question for you and it is this:

12   Although we know you cannot be present next week

13   because of other commitments, could you make

14   yourself available by telephone to answer under oath

15   any questions the jurors might have of you, if that

16   were to arise?

17             THE COURT: I was going to ask the jurors

18        at this point, do the members of the jury have

19        any questions for me? Only you can ask the

20        question.

21              MR. SCAROLA: We would stipulate to that

22        procedure, your Honor, so that no juror is

file:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%^pgNbr=466
23        rushed --

24             THE COURT: Let me ask you, Mr. Tyson, are

25        you comfortable in staying? 4924

1              JUROR TYSON: I'm sure it will be quick.

2             THE COURT: Mr. Tyson's question will be

3        presented to our deputy, if the deputy could

4        approach.

5             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

6        held out of the presence of the jury:)

7             THE COURT: Okay. The question is:  "What

8        responsibility do you believe the public health

9        community or U.S. government agencies have to

10        smokers of the '50s and '60s?" And second

11         question is:  "If so, what is it?"

12             Any objection from plaintiff?

13             MR. KELLY: What's the second question?

14             THE COURT: "If any, what is it?"

15             MR. KELLY: That's good.

16             MR. SCAROLA: Responsibility of the

17        government really is not an issue before this

18        jury. It really is a Fabre kind of question,

19        and I don't think it's appropriate for that

20        reason.

21              MR. KELLY: It is because it deals with

22        the issues within which the companies were

23        operating at the time. The public health

24        community was a big part of the '50s. There's

25        been a lot of testimony from Dr. Burney --4925

1              THE COURT: I'm going to overrule the

2        objection because it's been very much a part of

3        the evidence. Here's the other question. I

4        will read it over plaintiffs objection.

5         "Please clarify information related to brain

6        receptors. Dr. Cummings stated that the

7        receptors do not change before quitting.

8        Another witness stated that the receptors go

9        back to normal within a few weeks."

10             Any objection?

11              MR. BIERSTEKER: I think it's

12        inappropriate to be asked to comment on the

13        testimony of another witness.

14             MR. SCAROLA: I don't believe the question

15        is asking for that comment.

16             THE COURT: So R.J. objects, Philip Morris

17        does not object, and plaintiff does not object.

18        I'm going to read the question.

19             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

20        concluded and the following proceedings were

21         held within the presence of the jury:)

22             MR. SCAROLA: Thank you, your Honor.

23                     JUROR QUESTIONS

24             THE COURT: "What responsibility do you

file:///YI/..

.geny/Depos/2010.0722%20Trial%20Testimony%20of%20Michael%20Cummings%20Vol%201-5%20PIENDLE%20v%20RJR.txt[5/3/2013 2:36:09 PM]pgNbr=467
25       believe the public health community or U.S. 4926

1         government agencies have to smokers of the '50s

2        and '60s; if so, what is it?"

3             THE WITNESS: Well, their responsibility

4        was to support research, the health effects of

5        smoking, and basically put out information that

6        they had based on that research, and regulate

7        the -- based on the findings from that

8        research, as was made public to them, to take

9        actions that would affect the public's health.

10        The job of the government is to protect the

11        public's health.

12             THE COURT: And the next question is:

13         "Please clarify information related to brain

14        receptors. Dr. Cummings stated that the

15        receptors do not change before quitting.

16        Another witness stated" what the receptor --

17         "that the receptors go back to normal within a

18        few weeks."

19             THE WITNESS: A number of receptors, based

20        on my understanding of the literature, is that

21         our -- don't change, and once you develop more

22        receptors for nicotine, that is one of the

23        reasons it's so easy to fall back into smoking

24        again, because you permanently altered the

25        structure and function of the brain. 4927

1              There's the subject area of research now

2        going on to look at brain receptors and how

3        they change or if they change or if they're

4        desensitized with the length of time abstaining

5        from smoking, but my understanding is that it

6        doesn't go back completely to normal.

7             THE COURT: Okay. Any follow-up questions

8        from plaintiffs counsel?

9             MR. SCAROLA: No, your Honor.

10             THE COURT: Follow-up from defense

11         counsel?

12             MR. BIERSTEKER: No, your Honor.

13             MR. KELLY: No, your Honor.

14             THE COURT: Anything further from members

15        of the jury? If you want to hand your note to

16        Deputy Simmons and you can approach.

17             (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

18        held out of the presence of the jury:)

19             THE COURT: Okay. The question is:  "Has

20        there been any research for nonsmokers in

21         Mr. Piendle's age cohort who have experienced

22        the same influence?"

23             MR. KELLY: Can I have that again?

24             THE COURT: "Has there been any research

25        for nonsmokers in Mr. Piendle's age cohort who 4928

ffle:///YI/...geny/Depos/2010.07.22%20Trial%20Testimony^^pgNbr=468
1        have experienced the same influence?"

2             No objection.

3             (Thereupon, the sidebar conference was

4        concluded and the following proceedings were

5        held within the presence of the jury:)

6             THE COURT:  "Has there been any research

7        for nonsmokers in Mr. Piendle's age cohort who

8        have experienced the same influences?"

9             THE WITNESS: Yes. I mean, the studies

10        that have been done look at those who start

11         smoking and those who don't, and so it includes

12        both smokers and nonsmokers. But in his age

13        cohort of males, it was lower for females, in

14        terms of the influences on smoking would be

15        related to peer pressure, the affects on

16        marketing and, in fact, the studies on

17        marketing show that people who don't take up

18        smoking, young people are less exposed to

19        advertising, actually, and their recall of

20        advertising is lower. They have fewer friends

21         who smoke. They are less likely to have

22        parents who smoke. So that would be what I am

23        aware of, and that's true in the 1950s, as well

24        as studies that are ongoing today.

25             THE COURT: Any follow-up questions from 4929

1        plaintiffs counsel?

2             MR. SCAROLA: No, your Honor.

3             THE COURT: Defense counsel?

4             MR. KELLY: No, your Honor.

5             THE COURT: Any further questions from

6        members of the jury? Seeing no hands. Okay.

7             Ladies and gentlemen, let me excuse you

8        right now, so you can be on your way. We'll

9        see you back on Monday morning at 9:30. Please

10        check in downstairs first.

11              Remember the important instruction, you

12        can be walking as I'm talking, not to view any

13        media, do not discuss the case with anyone, and

14        have a good weekend. See you back at 9:30 on

15        Monday morning.

16             (Thereupon, the jury exited the courtroom,

17        after which the following proceedings were

18        held:)

19             THE COURT: I'm going to let you make your

20        proffer without Dr. Cummings here. You can

21        just proffer into the record what it is you

22        expect him to say. Dr. Cummings is going to

23        try to make his plane.

24             (The witness exited the courtroom.) 25
