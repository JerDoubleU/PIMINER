plaintiff's witness herein, being first duly sworn on oath, testified as follows: THE WITNESS:  I do. MR. CLARK:  If I may have just one moment to

kind of get set up, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Good afternoon, sir.

A.   Good afternoon.

Q.   We have quite a distance between us here, but I need to make sure the jury can see the screen.

Would you introduce yourself to the jury, please?

A.   Sure.  My name is Kenneth Michael Cummings, and I'm a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina.

Q.   Over the course of your career, what has been the subject or the focus of your research?

A.   Well, I've been in the area of cancer and cancer prevention and control for 35 years.  And my focus in that area has been on tobacco, all aspects, tobacco epidemiology, why people smoke, why people start smoking, helping them quit smoking.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1374

So that pretty well characterized --characterizes the topics that I've covered over the last 35 years.

Q.   Are you familiar with internal industry documents that have been disclosed to the public in the last 20 years?

A. Sure. Many of the internal documents were turned over to me when I was at Roswell Park Cancer Institute at Buffalo, New York. And I was involved early on in the late '90s when those documents became available in helping to digitize them, index them, study them, make them available for other scientists, the public, anybody who wants to see them.

Q.   I want to talk about your qualifications for a little bit.  But before I do, let me ask you, are you familiar with a gentleman by the name of Claude Teague?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And tell the jury who Claude Teague was.

A. Sure. Claude Teague was a scientist working at R.J. Reynolds. He started at R.J. Reynolds in 1951. He was a chemist by training and he rose up the ranks to be one of the senior executives at R.J. Reynolds and actually even when he started early on in his career was one of the top people in research and development at R.J. Reynolds.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=6
1375

Q.   As part of his job at R.J. Reynolds, did Dr. Teague have the opportunity to conduct research and write reports?

A.   Yes.  He wrote many reports that were actioned at R.J. Reynolds that I'm familiar with.

Q.   Are you familiar with one in particular from February of 1953?

A.   Sure.  His survey on cancer and how cigarette smoking is linked to cancer.  And it was essentially a review of the literature in different areas, chemistry, animal studies that had been done at that point, and clinical human studies, so people who were getting cancer, those who did and sort of comparing whether they smoked or didn't.  He summarized those data and, you know, drew some conclusions which were shared with the senior management at R.J. Reynolds.  And so I'm quite familiar with the study that he did.

MR. CLARK:  Plaintiff moves into evidence --

this is PT 03608, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1. THE COURT:  Okay.  Any objection? MR. CARTER:  No objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  It will be introduced

as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1 admitted in evidence.)

MR. CLARK:  We'll publish this � so I don't

have to keep approaching the witness, we'll publish

them on the screen, Your Honor. THE COURT:  That's fine. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Is this the document you were just referring to, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The title is, "Survey of Cancer Research With Emphasis Upon Partial Carcinogens From Tobacco." What are carcinogens?

A.   Those are basically chemicals that cause cancer.  Cancer-causing chemicals, essentially.

Q.   And this was dated 2 February 1953 by Claude Teague.

A.   Correct.

Q.   Is there a bibliography that goes with this report?

A.   Yes.  He cites, you know, studies that he had reviewed.  I think 78 citations are mentioned in the bibliography.  And, of course, it wasn't like today when you have the Internet.  But, you know, you could go to the library and find some of these.  Some of them were in a foreign language, which was very common because some of the studies were written by authors in different

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=8
1377

countries.  So you'd have to get the article translated.

Q.   In 1953 � strike that.

These articles that he cites, how many of them were in English?

A.   Oh, I haven't counted up.  Some were in English, as I mentioned.  Some of them were in other languages.  I'd have to go look to see what number were English and which ones weren't.

I mean, some of the authors I know pretty well. Dr. Roffo, who did many of the animal experiments, he was from Argentina and published most of his work in a different language than English.

Q.   Were these articles published in what is commonly referred to as the popular press?

A.   No.  These were scientific articles published in medical journals.  So, you know, scientists might find these.  These were not the kinds of things that would be available to any citizen, you know, unless you had special training and special interests to start going and doing detailed research.  I can understand why a cigarette company would look at it, but not the average citizen.

Q.   As part of your review of materials in this case, were you provided some materials by my office related to this case?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=9
1378

A.   Yes, I was.

Q.   And just briefly, what kind of materials were you provided?

A.   Well, there were worksheets that were prepared, as normally is done in these types of cases, that provides information on the plaintiff, their background, their medical conditions and such.  So they're called verified worksheets.  I received those.  I received medical records and also a number of depositions that were provided to me to review.

Q.   Did you review those materials?

A.   I did.

Q.   Did you see anything in those materials that would indicate John Barbose had a background in scientific research?

A.   I did not see anything in those documents that would suggest that.

Q.   Did Dr. Teague -- what was his degree in?

A.   He was a Ph.D. in chemistry.

Q.   Was he a scientist?

A.   Yes, he was a scientist.  As I said, he rose up the ranks at Reynolds to senior management level.  In the '70s, he was in charge of new product development. At various sometimes he was the head of the chemical labs.  So he had Dr. Rodgman and other staff working

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=10
1379

under him.  He would -- and then I think he retired in the mid '80s from R.J. Reynolds.

Q. We have displayed here for the jury -- this on page 7 of Dr. league's report. What are these drawings and symbols?

A.   Well, those are symbols.  He's describing various chemicals.  As a chemist, this is what chemists do.  They're providing the chemical structure of different things that you would find in tobacco potentially, and he's reviewing the literature on.

You know, 1953, not so easy to isolate all the chemicals.  They were developing the methods for isolating things and they were -- frankly, the literature was speculating what might be in tobacco smoke or what might be carcinogenic that the public gets exposed to from any source.  And he's reviewing that. And he's describing a particular class of carcinogens here called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which is what you get when you burn organic material like tobacco and paper and you inhale it.  You get a variety of these chemicals.  And there was some evidence available at this time, actually from Brown & Williamson, that it isolated �

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object to the

narrative.  I believe the question was, what are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1380

these drawings.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain that.  If you could ask the witness to just limit his responses to your specific inquiries.  Thank you.

MR. CLARK:  Sure, Your Honor. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Are these drawings -- who is the audience that these drawings are intended to communicate to?

A.   These would be scientists, other chemists. So -- you know, who would be interested in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo(a)pyrene, which was suspected as a potent carcinogen that had been isolated by Brown & Williamson at this time.

Q.   Now, they wouldn't be -- the lay public wouldn't be the audience, the intended audience.

MR. CARTER:  Object, Your Honor, leading. MR. CLARK:  I'll rephrase. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Would these drawings have any meaning to the general lay public?

A.   No, not that the drawings themselves.  I think the lay public probably would have wanted to know that there were carcinogens in tobacco.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, move to strike as

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=12
1381

nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Did Dr. Teague make some conclusions from his survey of the research?

A.   Yes, he has -- he goes through the three sections, chemistry, the animal studies, and the human studies.  And he draws the conclusions right here where he had noted that this rapid increase in lung cancer that had taken place in the 20th century which paralleled the rapid rise in cigarette smoking had led to the argument that cigarette smoking might be a cause. And what he indicates, the studies of clinical data --that's the human studies -- tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and the incidence of cancer of the lung.  And then he also points out that while there have been extensive, though inclusive, findings from the animal studies, they were generally consistent with the argument there were carcinogens in the tobacco and that the chemistry was evolving.  And so those are the conclusions that he reaches.

Q.   What did Dr. Teague do with this report?

A.   Well, this report, as I pointed out, was shared with senior management at --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=13
1382

Q.   Senior sergeant of who?

A.   R.J. Reynolds.

And he was told by the legal department at R.J. Reynolds not to share or distribute the report. And so basically he was told to keep the report quiet, this conclusion.

So this conclusion was never published. This report by an R.J. Reynolds scientist never came out in the public domain for scientists or anybody to see.

Q.   When did you first find this?

A.   I didn't find this really until the late 1990s when I was funded to look at the internal tobacco documents to try to address the question of what the tobacco companies knew about the harms of cigarette smoking and then to contrast that with what they had told the public.

Q.   And what year was it you discovered this?

A.   Late '90s.  Around '99, 2000, in that period.

Q.   Where was John Barbose at that time?

A.   He was dead.

Q.   Let's talk about your qualifications for just a second.  I promised we would do that.

You said you are currently employed by the Medical University of South Carolina.  What do you do there on a day-in-and-day-out basis?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=14
1383

A.   Well, I head up their tobacco research program. And that's done in conjunction with the Hollings Cancer Center, which is their cancer center at the university. So I do research on tobacco, all aspects of tobacco.

I also direct the program for our patients in the hospital.  So every patient that comes into the Medical University of South Carolina's hospital -- and we have about 30,000 patients we see every year as inpatients -- gets screened for tobacco use.  We have a bedside counselor that will go meet with the patients, try to develop a treatment plan.  And then we follow the patients after they leave the hospital to try to facilitate their ability to stay off cigarettes, because they're not allowed to smoke anymore when you come in the hospital.

Q.   I'm going to do this and I'm going to try not do it too many times, but I said I was going to get into your background.  But before I get too far into your background, have I asked you to come in here today and provide some testimony to assist this jury?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And are those going to be in the form of some expert opinions?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what are the topics that you understand

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=15
1384

you're going to be expressing to the jury over the next few days?

A.   I was asked to do a number of things.  One is to look at whether Mr. Barbose was addicted to nicotine. So my -- based on my work in understanding and assessing and treating many thousands of smokers over my 35-year career, I applied standard criteria that I use and provided -- I'm prepared to provide that opinion.

I was also asked to provide some historical context on the rise and fall of lung cancer in the 20th century and the factors that relate to that, including how cigarettes were engineered in a way that made it easy to deliver nicotine effectively through inhalation into the lung, which allows rapid uptake of nicotine in the brain, which made cigarette smoking addictive and how that relates to the rapid increase in smoking in this country and the subsequent increase in lung cancer that was seen about 10 or 15 years after that change in product design.  And then other aspects of cigarette engineering as they relate to addiction and health risk related to cigarette smoking.

Corresponding to that, I was asked to talk about the mass marketing of cigarettes and the marketing of cigarettes to youth in particular, since the companies have always said they don't market to youth,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=16
1385

they don't study the smoking habits of youth.  And so I have researched that question within their own internal business records and I'm prepared to, you know, share with you what I've learned in that regard as to whether they market to youth.

And then the engineering of the tobacco products in nicotine addiction.

Q.   If I missed it, I apologize.  Are you prepared to express any opinions on epidemiology regarding smoking-related diseases, specifically lung cancer?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you prepared to talk about some of the public statements compared to the private statements within the industry itself regarding the cigarette controversy?

A.   Yes.  Another area that I've been asked to comment on is the research that I've done that shows what the companies knew, when they knew it, and then what they told the public.  I refer to it as the 50-year coverup, because it sort of dates back to the early 1950s and really continued until the companies finally changed their positions in the -- in 2000 and after.

Q.   So let's talk about how we got here -- how you got here.  Would you give the jury the benefit of your education.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=17
1386

A.   Sure.  Well, I mean, I was trained originally as a health teacher, Miami University -- the other Miami, up in Ohio.  And then did an internship that led me to go in public health one summer.  And I applied to one public health school at the University of Michigan. They have a good football team.  Decided to go there. They gave me a scholarship actually to do a master's in public health, and then I stayed and did a Ph.D. in that area.

So I have public health training in health education and health behavior.  And then I ended up arriving at Roswell Park Cancer Institute after I finished up my Ph.D.  Actually did a little stint teaching at Wayne State University and then got a job at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, where I was involved in their cancer prevention program. I was there for 31 years.  That's where my research really began to focus on tobacco.  I ran stop-smoking clinics for patients that came into our hospital, developed a pretty big research program in tobacco.  And so I did that for 31 years.

And in 2011, after all my kids -- I have three boys.  They all moved to Charleston.  My grandkids started arriving in Charleston.  We were visiting Charleston.  I bought a house down there.  And shortly

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=18
1387

after we bought the house, the Medical University of South Carolina advertised they wanted a senior person in tobacco control.  I applied.  That's why I'm in Charleston.  And I've been there for the last, you know, four years and have enjoyed the weather.  Different from Buffalo, New York.  But essentially, you know, building up the program that they really didn't have in tobacco. Excellent work in addiction science, but they really didn't have a program really to deliver services to smokers.  And that's what I brought to the medical university.

Q.   So let's talk about Roswell Park, since you brought it up and you spent most of your career there.

What is Roswell Park? A.   It's a comprehensive cancer center.  Probably the comparable location here would be the Moffitt Cancer Center.  It's designated by the National Cancer Institute, our federal agency that funds cancer research, as a comprehensive cancer center because they do research on prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer and research around all of those areas.

So Roswell is actually the oldest cancer center in the country.  It's over 100 years old.  It was created by a surgeon by the name of Roswell Park.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=19
1388

That's where it got the name.  And I started there in early 1981.  And as I said, I spent 31 years there before going down to -- going south down to Charleston.

Q.   Now, this is a phrase I think the jury has heard.  Can you explain the phrase public -- what is the public health community?

A.   Well, it's a very broad group of people.  But the public health community is basically people who are trained in public health, have a master's in public health or a Ph.D. in that area.  They focus on populations rather than individuals.

Doctors who take care of us, they focus on patients.  Okay?  So they're not in public health. They're focused on individual patients.

In the public health sphere, we worry about the health of populations, of communities.  And there are a variety of specialty areas.  Epidemiology is one of them, which looks at, you know, person, place, time, trends in disease and tries to understand disease causation and interventions to mitigate or to reduce the occurrence of disease, both acute and chronic.  So food poisonings are an acute type.  Infection is a type of epidemiology, but also chronic disease where you're focusing on things like cancer or heart disease, COPD and other types of chronic illnesses.  So there are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=20
1389

others health -- you know, health services research is another area.  Maternal and child health is a part of public health, dental public health.  Again, they're focusing on policies and populations of individuals, not individual patients.

Q.   For the better part of four decades, have you been a member of that public health community?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And your work as it relates to the area of public health, do you teach?

A.   Sure.

Q.   What do you teach?

A.   So I teach our medical students.  And we have other allied health.  We have dental students.  We have pharmacists, nursing students, you know, physical therapy, social work all are part of the medical university.  I'm involved in teaching in all aspects around tobacco.  I give a lot of lectures at the university on my area of tobacco and how it relates to their specialty area that they're going into.

At Roswell Park, I taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  I still have that academic appointment because I'm still mentoring students who I started with years ago who are suffering through their dissertations to get finished.  But I

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=21
1390

taught epidemiology for 25 years to our graduate students there and then courses in health behavior and tobacco control, as well as just mentoring master's in Ph.D. and post docs and M.D.s who came through that program.  So I've trained quite a number of people who've gone on.  And that's your legacy, I've learned as I've gotten older, is the people you train.

Q.   You said you do research.  Do you write and publish your research?

A.   Yes.  You know, publish or perish.  It's not really true.  It's get grant or perish in the academic world.  But, you know, in order to do that, you have to be writing up the results of your findings in peer-reviewed publications.  So I've --

Q.   I'm going to talk about your publications here in a minute, but let me ask you.  We mentioned it briefly.  What is the field of epidemiology?

A.   Well, as I had described, it's really the study of population health.  We look at trends and disease, person, place, and time characteristics of individuals, you know, if you're older or younger or different race or whether you smoke or don't smoke.  Those are all characteristics of individuals that you can look at in relationship to disease outcomes.  Place where you live, so looking at disease variation in different locations.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=22
1391

And then time.  So you look at timeframes.  And you can combine all of those things.  That helps us begin to sort out the causes of diseases.  And that is a main focus of epidemiology, to try to figure out, you know, what things are leading to increases or perhaps hopefully decreases in disease patterns that we see in a population and then testing more effectively interventions.  So clinical trials to test vaccines and things are actually a part of public health practice.

Q.   Are you a medical doctor?

A.   Ph.D.  So the answer would be no.

Q.   Do you -- as part of your research and your work, do you perform assessments on people in an effort to determine whether or not they are addicted to nicotine and cigarettes?

A.   Yes.  I mean, when I came to Roswell Park, early on I set up their stop-smoking clinics.  And we did a whole bunch of research on methods for quitting smoking through those clinics, but I ran those clinics myself for the entire time I was there.  I probably treated personally over 10,000 smokers.  And as part of that, of course, you do assessments.  And the assessments sort of look at, you know, why people smoke, are they addicted to nicotine or not?  And then, how strongly they're addicted, because the strength of

nicotine dependence sort of dictates the kind of therapies that you're going to recommend to patients. So I would work with pharmacists and other doctors in running those programs and testing different strategies to help people quit.

Q.   Do you do those assessments in your daily practice outside of the legal setting where you're doing the assessments for a court case?

A.   Yeah.  I was doing those assessments well before I ever got involved in any court activity, and I continue do them.  I mean, at the medical university, I, you know, set up the assessments that our bedside counselors do.  So when we get the medical records that say that you're a smoker and we do an assessment and then develop a treatment plan, it's all based on the work that I set up.

And of course when I was at Roswell Park, I set up the New York State Smoker's Quitline.  So I established that free telephone service when I was there.  I ran it for 11 years.  It's treated over a million smokers in New York.  So we had trained all the counselors, developed the protocols.  And a lot of the stuff that we developed in New York has been copied, happily, and utilized elsewhere in many other states.  I think every state now has a quitline and they've pretty

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=24
1393

much copied the protocols that we developed and implemented and tested.

Q.   I told you we would get to your publications. So let's talk about your publications, what you've written.

Let's start off by explaining to the jury, what is a peer-review process journal?

A.   Okay.  So when you publish, it's like a magazine, but it's a magazine for experts in your field, so other scientists in your field.  And peer-review merely means when you send in a, you know, scientific paper that describes the results of your studies or somebody else sends it in and you're asked to review it, in other words, they send it to peers, other people that have expertise in that area.  And they would be asking them to make comments to the editors.  Is this any good? Is it significant?  Are you building on the science that exists?  Are their methods okay?  Have they overreached the findings of their study?  It's a way to try to make sure the stuff that, you know, goes into scientific publications is important and is adding new information and is accurate and valid.  And so you typically have to have served as an editor of journals as well as on the peer-review side, you're asked to give comments back to editor or editorial board.  And they usually go to three

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=25
1394

or four peer-reviewers.  And then they -- you know, if they're consistently this is terrible, all bad, that paper is probably not getting published.  If it's mixed results, then the editorial team has to make a decision as to whether they're going to ask for revisions and so on.  It's how we try to, you know, advance science. It's the best process that we have for doing that.  So that's peer review.

Q.   The articles that Dr. Teague researched in '53, were those articles contained in peer-reviewed publications?

A.   I would say most of them were, yes.

Q.   What's the difference -- I think you've kind of talked ability it, but what's the difference between the peer-reviewed journals and what we typically see in the popular press?

A.   Well, what you get in the popular press is not peer-reviewed.  We hope that whoever is writing, you know, the reporters are checking facts and getting the facts correct.  But as we all know, I think that's not always, you know, true.  And it's not always true in peer review.  There's no guarantee that that works. But, you know, the process of peer review is to try to weed out, you know, errors and bias that you might get in the popular press.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=26
1395

Q.   What are some of the more prestigious or well respected peer-review journals?

A.   Well, New England Journal is -- you know, in the medical field is probably the top journal.  You know, in Europe you probably have the British Medical Journal or Lancet.  And then you can sort of -- there are many specialty areas in public health, the American Journal of Public Health in the cancer area, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute or Cancer, which is the journal published by the American Cancer Society.  And then in my area of addiction, there is Addiction. There's a journal called Addiction.  It's well-respected.  Nicotine and Tobacco Research, Tobacco Control, these are -- and then there's many other journals that, you know, publish in the medical field and particularly tobacco.  Tobacco is probably the most studied risk factor in medical history.  So you see it in all kinds of different journals.

Q.   And are you published in those journals you just mentioned?

A.   Well, the New England, I've got one sitting there.  I hope they accept it.  But I've reviewed for them on a number of occasions.  I actually don't send my stuff to New England Journal.  I think I've been published in JAMA before.  But, you know, I published in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=27
1396

the American Journal of Public Health many times and JNCI, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Cancer, Addiction.  The tobacco journals I'm all over basically because that's most of what my research is about.

Q.   How does one become a reviewer for one of these journals?

A.   Basically -- I don't know how you become -- I know how I selected reviewers.  I would go to meetings and see people's work and get the list of people who attended meetings.  So as an editor, I was always searching for peer reviewers because you're asking them to volunteer their time to spend reading and giving you critical, careful reviews of papers.  So it takes time and effort.  I usually am reviewing three or four articles a week for other journals.  And I don't know how I actually got on all those lists, but I suspect because I published a lot in the field and I'm well-known in the field under the area of tobacco.  So that's probably how I ended up on the list.

Q.   Let's talk about that.  I've got your CV in front of me.  How many publications have you published -- how many articles have you published?

A.   I had probably published about 400 or so, you know, peer-reviewed papers and a bunch of chapters and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=28
1397

written in monographs and Surgeon General's reports and things of that nature as well.

Q.   I want to ask you about a few of them if you don't mind.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You published one -- or you're an author on one titled "Consumers Knowledge and Beliefs About the Safety of Cigarette Filters in Tobacco Control." Do you remember that one?

A.   Sure.

Q.   What was that about?

A.   Well, we asked -- it was a simple question to ask, you know, both smokers and nonsmokers whether if, you know, thought a filter on a cigarette made it safer or not.  And so --

Q.   You published your findings from that research?

A.   We did.  We also asked as part of that, I think, whether consumers were aware of a problem called filter fiber fallout.  Because when you put a cigarette filter made out of cellulose acetate in your mouth, some of the fibers come off.  And if your lungs are impaired by cigarette smoke, as most smokers have lungs that are impaled, they'll inhale those fibers coated with tar into their airways.  And that's not a good thing.

Q.   Here is another one, "Failed Promises of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=29
1398

Cigarette Industry and It's Effect on Consumer Misperceptions About the Health Risks of Smoking and Tobacco Control."

What was that one about?

A.   That was about really telling a little bit of the history of the -- you know, the conspiracy that --of the cigarette companies that began in the 1950s to sort of cover up the health -- what they knew about the health risks of smoking.  And so they had put out an ad called the Frank Statement to smokers.  And they made --

Q.   Are we going to see that?

A.   Yeah, hopefully.

-- made three affirmative promises to the American public and -- you know, that they would put their health above all other considerations of their business; that they would work with public health authorities; and that they believed their products were not injurious to health.  And we go through and carefully look at what they knew internally versus what they were saying publicly, and I think the title speaks for itself, the failed promises.  So that was my conclusion.

Q.   Just maybe a couple more.  "Marketing to America's Youth, Evidence From Corporate Documents in Tobacco Control."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=30
1399

What was that one about?

A.   Well, that's the study that I did, you know, again when the documents became available.  Because it was very common for the companies forever, actually, to say that they don't -- you know, they're not interested in marketing to youth and they don't study the smoking habits of youth.  And to look internally at their documents and to see whether that -- those statements were accurate or not and then to look at how products were marketed along the four Ps, product design, pricing, placement, and promotion.  So the four Ps of marketing.  And we analyzed the business records of the different cigarette companies in that regard.

Q.   "Cigarettes with Defective Filters Marketed for 40 Years, What Philip Morris Never Told Smokers in Tobacco Control."

Do you remember that one?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What was that about?

A.   Well, again, it's a review of the history of what -- you know, filters came on in the '50s essentially.  And it goes back to internal documents from Philip Morris where they had -- actually the term "filter fiber fallout" isn't my term.  It's actually a term from Philip Morris.  They coined it.  It's part of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=31
1400

their quality control on the products.  And how they had, in fact, known for many decades that the filtering material can actually dislodge and get into the lungs of smokers.

And it's plastic material.  Cellulose acetate really comes from photographic film.  Kodak was the inventor of the cigarette filter.  So it's painted white to give it its white appearance, but it's really translucent.  And there's small, tiny fibers and they do break off.  You touch it to your tongue, we can show that they come off.  You plant them in animals, the fibers are still there.  They cause inflammation, which is the beginning of disease process.

And so I'm basically reviewing the internal business records of Philip Morris as well as other tobacco companies, including Reynolds, because they knew the same thing.

Q.   I believe the jury was introduced to the Surgeon General today during opening statements.  Can you briefly describe what the Office of the Surgeon General is?

A.   Sure.  I mean, it's a presidential appointment. It's a -- you know, the person who is appointed is a physician who is in charge of the U.S. Public Health Service.  And the U.S. Public Health Service is the arm

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=32
1401

of the government that's in charge of public health for the country.  And so, you know, there are different types of Surgeon Generals.  Every branch of the military has their own surgeon general as well.  And so they usually -- you know, in the tobacco area, I think most people are familiar with the fact that the Surgeon General has put out the reports on smoking and health.  Those reports date back to 1964, the initial report.  I think we had the 50th anniversary report that came out last year.  And so the Office of the Surgeon General is -- the president appoints the top doctor, essentially, to the U.S. Public Health Service.

Q.   And you've talked about the reports and your publications.  Have you been involved in the preparation of any of the Surgeon General's reports?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you identify which reports and what your roles were?

A.   Sure.  My first involvement in, you know, Surgeon General's reports -- it's an honor to be asked to contribute in some way -- was as a peer reviewer.  So the reports are -- the Surgeon General's reports are peer review on steroids.  They're usually, you know, I think over a hundred, you know, peer reviewers in the 2014 report as I recall.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=33
1402

But 1988, that was the report on nicotine addiction.  I was asked to be a peer reviewer.  That was my first involvement.  So I reviewed a section of the report, wrote, you know, my critique and sent it back to the editors of the report.

And in 1988 I must have done a good job because in 1989, they asked me to write a section of the report. So that was the first time I actually was a writer, contributor to a section of the report.  And then I participated in just about all the reports except for maybe one or two between 1988 and 2014, either as a contributor or reviewer.

In 2010, I was a reviewer of the entire report. So after they had done all the peer reviews, all the writing was done, they send it to usually four or five people to look over the entire thousand pages of stuff and give, you know, final critique back to the editors before it's finally published.  And so I did that in 2010.  2012, I reviewed and contributed.  And in 2014, I reviewed, I contributed and then was an overall reviewer of that report.

Q.   And these -- I believe we have some of these reports.  They're colored.  Do the colors mean anything?

A.   Well, silver was the 25th Anniversary, you know.  And I don't know where they came up with the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=34
1403

brown cover.  Maybe that's what tobacco looks like.

Q.   That's the 1988 one on nicotine addiction?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And this is the -- can you identify this one?

A.   That's the silver -- that's the Golden Anniversary, you know, 2014, I believe.

Q.   That's the one that just came out last year?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   You were an overall reviewer for this one?

A.   And a contributor and reviewer of sections of it.

Q.   The 1988 report, what was significant about that on nicotine addiction?

A.   Well, the '88 report was significant because it asked the question, Why do people smoke?  And their conclusion was that people smoked because they were addicted to nicotine and that nicotine was the addictive substance in cigarettes and that the effect of nicotine, both behaviorally and pharmaceutically, were similar to other drugs of abuse such as heroin and cocaine.  So those were the main conclusions.  I think that was you know, most people at that time thought smoking is sort of a habit; it's hard to quit, but it's more of a behavioral thing.  Here they're saying this drug addiction.  And so that was the significance of that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=35
1404

report.

Q.   What is the World Health Organization --actually, strike that.  We'll come to the World Health Organization.

You mentioned it a minute ago, so I'm going to ask you about it.  You said it's an honor to be asked to be on the Surgeon General's reports.

Let's talk about some of the awards you've received for your work over the years.  Can you tell the jury what the Joseph W. Cullen award is?

A.   That's an award obviously named after Joe Cullen, who was at the National Cancer Institute for many years.  And he died, too early.  And they named an award after him.  And they give out the award annually to somebody in the tobacco area at the American Society of Preventive Oncology.  So I received that award.  I think it was 2008 or '09, something like.

Q.   What about the John Slade award?

A.   Another person who died too young.  John Slade is probably one of the leading experts in understanding cigarette design and engineering and how it keeps people hooked on cigarettes.  He was one of the founders of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and they named an award after him that I received in 2009.

Q.   And the Luther Terry award -- Luther L. Terry

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=36
1405

award.  I'm sorry.

A.   Sure.  Luther Terry was the Surgeon General in 1964, and so the American Cancer Society memorialized an award in his name they give out at the world conference on smoking and health.  They meet every three years.  So that award is given out every three years.  And so I received that award also.  I had a good year in 2009.  I guess I must be getting old and they start handing out awards.  But they gave me that award.  And in my field in tobacco, it's probably the highest award you can get because they give you a little medal and it's a -- it's a really nice ceremony that they have.  But of course, you know, looking back at Luther Terry, I mean, that was the initial report.  So it has a lot of significance for people in public health.

Q.   All right.  So let's talk about the World Health Organization.  What is the World Health Organization?

A.   Well, I think the name speaks for itself.  And it's part of, you know, the global efforts.  The United Nations and WHO is that arm that focuses on global health issues like Ebola that's probably been in the news.  So they're usually the group that's, you know, looking at responding to those kinds of events, but also noncommunicable diseases because that's what really --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=37
1406

when you look at leading causes of death worldwide, they're things like cardiovascular disease and cancer and COPD.  And so they have research that they do, tracking trends and interventions that they apply.  So I've done some work obviously because they have a major focus on tobacco and have been involved in doing international studies dating back to the early 2000s.  I have studies now in 22 countries currently.

MR. CLARK:  Approach the witness, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   You might need this at some point.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You said you currently conduct research on behalf of the World Health Organization?

A.   Yeah.  I mean, I've written materials, done monographs for an organization called the International Agency on Research on Cancer, which is a branch of WHO. We did a monograph for them on evaluating tobacco control interventions that are happening in different countries, you know, warning labels, clean indoor air policies, tax policies, educational campaigns, policies around product regulation.  So we sort of mapped out what was known in those areas and how the studies are done.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=38
1407

And then I have a monograph I'm doing for WHO now on product regulation.  So that looks at all aspects of cigarette design and, again, how to make it less addictive and reduce the burden of disease that you see globally.

Q.   You use the term "monograph."  What is a monograph?

A.   Well, monographs are -- usually you go out and you get other people who have expertise.  And tobacco is -- you know, you go from chemistries to animal studies to neuroscience.  So you get experts in those areas that are contributing.  And, you know, as an editor of a monograph, you're sort of orchestrating that and putting it together to tell the story in a way that you're, you know, reviewing the science and where are the gaps, where are we going, what really makes a difference.  I mean, that's the intent of trying to keep current on the literature, and that's what monographs tend do.  The Surgeon General's report is a monograph essentially.

THE COURT:  Counsel, would this be a good point

to take a break, or would you --

MR. CLARK:  It's always a good point,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Why don't we do it now.

A.   All right.

Q.   Can you give us an estimate of how many times you've testified in tobacco-related cases like this?

A.   I've probably done about 90 trials.  I started doing this in 1996, so -- and probably given over 120 depositions.  Maybe more.  I haven't counted them all.

Q.   And that's not all from my firm?

A.   No.  No.

Q.   During the course of those trials, have you been allowed to give testimony on cigarette design?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you have roughly about six subset opinions regarding cigarette design that you routinely testify about?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you tell the jury what those opinions are?

A.   Well, I mean, basically, the products are engineered to make it hard for people to stop; that the products are engineered in ways that make them particularly dangerous to consumers, where one and two users, long-term users, will die prematurely as a result of continued use of cigarettes; that products are marketed in ways and designed in ways to have appeal to different target audiences that the consumers -- or that

1412

the manufacturers are interested in recruiting, starting with youth, beginning smokers.

So there are products that are considered starter products, as well as products that hold people in the market.  They usually refer to those as the "health concerned smokers."  Things like the addition of filters and light and low-tar products and so on sort of fall into that category.

So I haven't memorized every opinion, but if you have others that I haven't hit on, those are the main ones, I think.

Q.   Now, going back to your time at Roswell Park, how did you obtain your expertise in cigarette design?

A.   Well, I was doing research.  I started running stop-smoking clinics when I came to Roswell and really learned from the smokers.  And one of the questions that became apparent to me early on was that smokers could tell you that they had tried to quit many times, that it was hard to quit, but they didn't know why.

And I didn't know the answer why, either, and really began to focus on the issues of cigarette design and how they may relate to the kinds of products that people selected, what products they were using because they knew they were trying to quit and so on.

And then when the internal business documents

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=44
1413

became available, it was a real great opportunity to really see inside the companies what -- how they had engineered their products and how it relates to, you know, the inability of a lot of people to easily stop smoking.

And so I got interested in that.  The documents sort of fueled that.  And as a result, I established --because a lot of companies were back-engineering other companies' products.

Q.   Can you explain what that is, please? A.   Sure.  They would buy the companies' products, they would dissect them, and they would look at the chemistry of the products and the blend and the additives that are used and how it's engineered, the type of filter.  It's quite a complex area, because altering one element can have a big effect on performance and use and, you know, varying the dose of nicotine and how it's delivered to the smoker.  And things that affect inhalation of the cigarette smoke make a big difference.

And so as a result of that, I set up my own lab in the early 2000s, basically, to back-engineer cigarettes and created a tobacco testing lab.  And we've done many studies looking at the engineering of products.  One of the questions is are these products

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=45
1414

static.  When you buy a Marlboro, is it the same product or does it change over time, and has it been modified, and are those modifications known to people -- known to scientists, known to the consumers who are using the products?  Which they largely aren't.

And so why does that have to be done?  Because the product formulas and so on are considered trade secret.  They're not available to the consumers.

As I said, the internal documents were largely picking up on other companies' testing and following the designs of products that were in the marketplace.  And we set up our own lab and have been doing that work since the early 2000s and, you know, working with labs all over the world now, because this is a big area.  You can't regulate a product if you don't understand it. Q.   How did you obtain the cigarettes that you tested in your lab?

A.   Very simply.  We go buy them just like any consumer would.  So we buy the cigarettes off the shelf as a consumer would.  However, like a consumer, we are not smoking those products, necessarily.  We come back and dissect them and so on.  We buy extra product. We'll freeze the product.  And then we have special equipment that will unfreeze the product back to its normal state so we can look at cigarettes purchased

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=46
1415

many, many years ago and have them in a way that when you recondition the product, you have it like it's a fresh pack that somebody would be buying, because you want to get the performance that the smoker would get.

If you leave a pack of cigarettes on the shelf for a couple years, it dries out pretty easily, so it's not going to perform the same way.

Q.   I think we have pictures of that freezer.

A.   Yes.  So this is at Roswell.

Q.   I want to see if you can explain what we see in these paragraphs.

A.   That's just showing you the cigarettes.  We have, you know, tens of thousands of cigarette packs purchased from all over the world so we can look at, you know, Marlboros from this country versus Marlboros from other parts of the world.  And we can go back in time, so -- they're all date stamped -- and look at the information that's contained on the pack, because the pack is one of the ways that companies communicate information to consumers.  And how that's changed is one of the things that we've looked at.

So this is just, you know, the freezer.  We have a walk-in freezer.  And as I said, we have probably about 100,000 packs of cigarettes at this point that we've accumulated.  And those are valuable, particularly

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=47
1416

the older packs.  Because when you want to compare products today to what it was a decade ago, nobody has this outside the tobacco companies.

So we sort of set up something that was missing in the public health area and now share our materials with other government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Q.   Now, you've mentioned the documents, and we've shown one, the Dr. Teague document.  But was there a time where you actually came into possession of a significant amount of documents that were once secret inside the industry?

A.   Yes.  In the late '90s, as I mentioned, companies were compelled to turn over, you know, their own documents as well as documents of companies or agencies or organizations that they funded.  The Tobacco Institute was one of those.  The Council for Tobacco Research was another one of these organizations.

The Tobacco Institute and Council for Tobacco Research documents got turned over to me, so they actually got delivered -- their actual hard copy files got turned over to me.  And I really didn't know how much I was going to get.  I just said I wanted them.  So it turned out I was getting moving van levels of documents coming to me every two weeks, several, you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=48
1417

know, dozens of pallets.

Q.   We have the pictures.  Is that what it looked like at the time?

A.   It did.  This was just a partial component, because they would come in every two weeks.  I ended up getting grant funding and supporting an effort to digitize it so it would be available in a searchable form because they were, as it turned out, about 16 million pages of materials that arrived to us.  And it was a big operation.  It took us five or six years to actually digitize all the materials.

We developed the indexing that is used now today to go through all of the internal business records of the companies.  So just like when you to go a library and you have a card catalog, we created an index that will allow people to search across all of the company documents and these affiliated organizations.  And now they're about 80 million pages total.  So we physically had to deal with 16 million.

And then, in addition, I dealt with a virtual digital version of documents that each of the defendants put up -- were compelled to put up online, and developed a way to search across the companies, because they each had individual searching strategies that made it very hard to get the information.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=49
1418

So we spidered all the documents, developed an indexing system.  And that's now been turned over to the University of California, San Francisco.

Q. And you got these documents in the late 1990s. Were you aware of their -- of the information contained in those documents prior to that?

A.   No.  I mean, they -- you know, they were individual documents that people began to see that suggested there would be useful information, but we really didn't know, really, how well it was put together.  And the materials that we got were particularly well organized, because they came in context.  They were actually files from various people who worked for the Tobacco Institute and, over time, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which later became known as the Council for Tobacco Research.

Those two organizations were incorporated in New York State.  So being in Buffalo, those documents got turned over to New York State, and that that's how I ended up -- they contacted me and said, Do you want this material?

It turned out to be highly valuable for asking questions about what the companies knew, when they knew it, what they were telling the public about smoking and health issues, cigarette design, and the engineering of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=50
1419

tobacco products, marketing to different target groups and so on.

So it's dominated my research and research of a lot of other people in the last 15 years.  It's been an eye opener.

Q.   Did you also receive audio/video recordings, as well?

A.   Yeah.  The Tobacco Institute and, earlier, before that, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, had a communications committee, really the spokesperson in a unified way for the tobacco industry, because they contributed the funds.  They spoke with the unified voice on smoking and health issues, for the most part. And they did that through their spokespeople at the Tobacco Institute.  And so they kept track of everything, pretty much, that they said.

And when they went on television or radio, they had audio and videotapes which you ended up digitizing as well as the paper press releases and newspaper clips and all their various pamphlets and materials that they widely disseminated to anybody who asked them about issues related to smoking and health.

Q.   On the left side of what we have blown up here, we have some folders, and they're labeled "Special Projects."  Did you come to learn what Special Projects

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=51
1420

were during your review of the internal documents?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What were those?

A.   Sure.  Special projects was a program that was part of the Council for Tobacco Research.  That was an organization that was supposedly funding, you know, independent research into the allegations of smoking and disease and special -- you know, selected by independent, you know, esteemed scientists and so on. And there was a component of CTR that did that.

But Special Projects were the nonpeer-reviewed studies that got funded, selected primarily by the lawyers working for the cigarette companies, to help them basically maintain the fact that there was this controversy that smoking had been proven to cause disease or any harm in -- they also used Special Projects to recruit spokespeople that would appear in public hearings; for example, in front of Congress. They appeared often in publications put out by the Tobacco Institute, "Leading scientists say smoking doesn't cause disease, it's just not known yet, more research is needed."

It turns out, as we now know, many of those Special Projects' scientists or the people saying that, we thought were independent scientists, were on the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=52
1421

payroll.

Q.   In the late 1990s, when you began -- first began researching all the information that was contained in these internal documents, how many years had you spent by that point in time in tobacco research?

A.   Well, I was started in '80, '81.  When I finished up, came to Roswell, that's when I really began to focus on tobacco as an area.  And so I got my hands on the documents in the late '90s.  So a couple of decades before that.  And I've been doing a lot of research on tobacco and why people smoke and why young people start and what we could do to try to slow young people from taking up cigarettes and so on.  But that was about 25 years before I finally got the documents.

Q.   And when you -- strike that.

While you were researching these documents and learning information, were you finding out information in these internal documents that you, as a 20-year researcher, didn't already know?

A.   Yes.  Lots of information.  Had no clue about cigarette design and how the products had been engineered both to attract young people, who were sort of averse to the nicotine, sort of knock your socks off. So they actually engineered products in ways that would make it easy for young people to acquire nicotine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=53
1422

addiction.  And then how they designed their products to keep people smoking, so maintaining a minimum amount of nicotine, not going below a threshold that would allow somebody to freely walk away from smoking.

So in a variety of engineering strategies, how they blend the product, genetic hybridization, bioengineering of tobacco plants, you know, the use of manmade tobacco that's common in cigarettes, use of various additives that are put in the product that have effects on inhalation, because you've got to get it into the lungs.

The lungs are a big surface area that allows the nicotine to get absorbed and hit the brain in seven seven to ten seconds.  A lot of that was not known to me, so that was eye opening.  The marketing, the youth. It's all been eye opening, to tell you the truth, and I share it with anybody who will listen.

Q.   Now, if you had been researching tobacco for 20 years and you learned all this information only upon the release of these documents, is there anyone -- or has your research revealed that anyone in the public would have known what was contained in these documents prior to 1998?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls for speculation.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1423

THE COURT:  Sustained, unless you can provide a

foundation for that question. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let's talk about some specific things you did learn from these particular documents.

You said you didn't know anything about cigarette design?

A.   Well, I knew, you know, not much other than there's a filter, there's tobacco inside.  I really didn't fully comprehend how all those elements fit together in a way that made it hard for people to quit.

Q.   Did the information that you learned regarding cigarette design that you learned from these documents, are you able to find that -- or were you able to find, prior to 1998, that same information anywhere else in the public domain?

A.   There was information.  Certainly you can find in Surgeon General's reports discussions of issues around cigarette design.  There are other reports, you know, scientific reports that talk about this, but not at the level of understanding the brand, you know, why Marlboro became the most successful brand on the planet. For example, that wasn't revealed.

And so there were some things that were in the public domain for a scientist like myself that you would

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=55
1424

read about, and there were other things that weren't fully understood. Certainly, the consumer would not have the knowledge. That was based on my experience working with thousands and thousands of smokers.

Q.   As part of forming your opinions in this case, one of the things you reviewed -- you briefly mentioned it.  Was one of the things you reviewed the deposition testimony of Ms. Phyllis Barbose?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And are you familiar with her testimony regarding some of the brands that Mr. Barbose smoked?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   And can you identify what brands Mr. Barbose smoked?

A.   Well, early on, there was a Camel, and Lucky Strike were mentioned, Marlboro, Marlboro Lights, Doral were the primary brands, but I think there was some Winston also mentioned as well.

Q.   And are you familiar with her testimony regarding why Mr. Barbose switched to Marlboro Lights?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what did she report as the reason why Mr. Barbose switched to Marlboro Lights?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls for

hearsay.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=56
1425

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Based on my review of her

deposition, she said he switched to the lights

thinking they were safer for him. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And is that information that was -- strike that.  Let me ask a different question.

Back to the documents that you received, did you -- did the documents that you received, did they give you additional information regarding the company's knowledge of nicotine and nicotine addiction?

A.   Yes.  Particularly historically how far back they knew their products were addictive and how they engineered their products to make it hard to quit.

Q.   And as a person that was -- I believe you said you were a reviewer for the 1988 Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And even as a reviewer on that, you still learned information -- or did you learn additional information about nicotine addiction from these documents?

A.   Absolutely.  Still learning.

Q.   You're still learning?

A.   Still learning.  There's 80 million pages.  I

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=57
1426

haven't read them all.

Q.   In addition to the brands that you learned from the deposition testimony, did you also have the opportunity to review the deposition testimony of Samuel Barbose?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did you learn any additional brand history from Mr. Samuel Barbose?

A.   Yes, I did.

Q.   And can you tell us what you learned from that?

A.   Sure.  I mean, you know, Mr. Barbose's brother and -- obviously, he was asked about his knowledge of his brother growing up in terms of when he started smoking, which I think he said, by his account, it was around age 15 or so.  And he remembered him snitching cigarettes, Philip Morris cigarettes.  I think he got them from his father's store.

Q.   Let me ask you about that for a second.

We have a defendant Philip Morris, and you said "Philip Morris."  Was that a particular brand or what? Can you elaborate?

A. Yes. It's Philip Morris Tobacco Company and, yes, they had a brand called Philip Morris back in the 1950s, which is right around the time that Mr. Barbose was beginning to smoke.  And so yes and yes.  It's a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=58
1427

brand as well as the company.

Q.   As a result of your education and your training and your experience and your research, have you developed an expertise regarding the history of the modern cigarette and the history of tobacco use, in general?

A.   Yes.

Q. And have you studied, researched, compiled, and catalogued information regarding the role of advertising and how advertising plays an effect on cigarette sales?

A.   Sure.  Before the documents became available, I was interested in cigarette advertising and the effects of advertising on brand selection and which brands young people were smoking, which brands for adult smokers, between lights and low-tar, because they were popular.

You mentioned the filtered cigarette.  That was another area that I had focused some attention on; when they became popular and who was smoking them and who switched and who didn't.

So that was all part of the research that I was doing.  I collected and have an archive of, you know, probably 10,000, you know, cigarette ads, print, billboard, point-of-sale types of ads, promotions, those kinds of things that I digitized; as well as I have a collection of about 700 or so TV and radio ads that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=59
1428

appeared primarily in the '50s and '60s when cigarette advertising was still on television.

Q.   Let me switch gears just for a second.

This jury has heard a lot about the Engle class-action lawsuit.  Are you aware of that particular class-action lawsuit?

A.   Sure.  I testified in the original Engle case twice.

Q.   And what were the subjects of your testimony in Engle?

A.   Talked about cigarette advertising and talked about cigarette design, things like filter fiber fallout, consumer knowledge, what they knew.  So all those topics -- you know, nicotine addiction, some of --just, essentially, the same things here, although, we didn't have the full scope of the documents, actually, at that time.  They were just becoming available.

Q.   Now, getting ready to turn to some of the -- as my partner, Mr. Bigger, referred to earlier this week, the meat of the coconut here on your testimony.

Are you prepared to show us during your testimony over the next couple of days evidence that demonstrates how long R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Philip Morris USA, as well as other cigarette companies and organizations, had actual knowledge of the health

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=60
1429

hazards of cigarettes that they manufactured and marketed and sold during the life of John Barbose?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   Are you also prepared to show this jury evidence showing the manner in which R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris conspired with other cigarette companies to wage a fraudulent public relations campaign regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   Are you charging to be here today?

A.   I do.

Q.   And what are you charging to be here?

A.   My trial testimony fee is 250 an hour.

Q.   What would you be doing if you weren't here testifying today?

A.   I'd be back at the Medical University of South Carolina at my desk dealing with a lot of the crises that I'll deal with when I get out of here and have to get back on my cell phone again.

Q.   Now, in preparation for your testimony, have you reviewed and selected some documents that were previously secret to -- internal to the industry that you had planned to show this jury?

A.   Yes.  I've selected a number of documents to show the jury that, you know, relate to the areas of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=61
1430

testimony.  It's not every document, but I think they're an accurate representation of the topics that you've mentioned, I believe the conspiracy.  So I have a good idea of how it was put together and how it was executed and the effect.

Q.   So as a starting point, Doctor, why don't you tell this jury, what is a cigarette?

A.   Well, by definition, a cigarette is a roll of tobacco and a piece of paper used for smoking.

Q.   And what we know is a cigarette today, has it always been like that?

A.   Well, the cigarette has evolved dramatically over time.  So if you go back to the early part of the -- you know, the late 1900s, early part of the 20th century, most cigarettes were hand rolled.  They were typically a single blend, either Turkish or Burley tobacco, which makes a difference.

Turkish tobacco tends to have not a whole lot of nicotine in it, so it didn't really sustain continued use.  It wasn't particularly addictive.  It was more of a novelty.

Burley tobacco wasn't very popular as a cigarette, because in the blend of a cigarette, it's harsh and difficult to inhale, widely used in cigars. And so at the turn of the 20th century, the predominant

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=62
1431

forms of tobacco were chewing tobacco and cigars.

Cigar smoke is not easily inhaled because of the Burley tobacco.  The high pH makes it hard to inhale it.  So most people hold the smoke in the mouth, which is why cigar-only smokers tend to not get the lung cancer and a lot of the other diseases that we see in cigarette smokers.

Q.   Is there a term that you refer to the blending of the Turkish and Burley tobaccos?

A.   What happened in the early part of the 20th century in the modern cigarette was the blending of different types of tobacco, particularly the addition of bright, flue-cured tobacco, well known in South Carolina, because we're the largest producer of flue-cured tobacco.

Q.   What is flue-curing?

A.   Well, flue-curing is where they take the tobacco -- they cure tobacco in a variety of ways.  But flue-curing is where you use heat to speed up the curing process.

So you put the tobacco -- you hang it in the barns.  And then in the olden days, they would have, you know, a fireplace and the chimney going inside the barn. And they would use wood to, you know, heat that chimney, and that would create heat.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=63
1432

As things got a little bit more sophisticated, they used metal containers.  They got liquid propane gas, like your gas grill, and they would superheat the tobacco and it would cure it more rapidly and would turn the bright green leaves to that yellow golden brown.

And flue-cured tobacco alters pH in a way that makes it milder and easier to inhale the smoke.  So the addition of the bright tobacco to the high content Burley tobacco -- too harsh to inhale -- with the Turkish tobacco, that was the American blend.  Made cigarette smoke -- changed cigarette smoking in this country.

The introduction of Camel in 1913 was really the -- marked the first blended cigarette tobacco.  The modern cigarette, really.  And cigarette sales took off because people became addicted to those cigarettes and needed to smoke a pack a day, basically.  And before that, that had not been the case.

Q.   Prior to 1913, how long had people -- and people around the world --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- how long had people been using tobacco products?

A.   Oh, you know, you can go back, I'm sure, centuries in King James and so on.  And so tobacco has

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=64
1433

been around for a while.  But, you know, simply taking tobacco and chopping it up -- raw tobacco leaves and chopping it up and rolling it in a piece of paper, you will choke on it.  You can't inhale it.  It's got to be treated and cured.

Burley tobacco is typically air-cured. In other words, they hang it up in the barns, but they don't use the heat source.

And Turkish tobacco usually is cured in the sunlight.

Q.   And is the -- what is -- what is the major difference between the -- the tobacco that was used centuries ago and the -- and the tobacco that's used in the cigarettes today?

A.   Well, it's -- you know, one of the major differences, beginning in the 1950s, basically, they started introducing manmade tobacco, so what they call as reconstituted tobacco, into cigarettes.  I believe Camel was the first to do that as well.  So Camel was the first, you know, blended cigarette.

I think Lucky Strike came on in 1916 and then Chesterfield, which had been a brand that had been around for a while, reformulated.  And those three brands dominated over the next, you know, 30, 40 years, and every cigarette really after that has used the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=65
1434

American blend.

But beginning of the 1950s, they began to use a reconstituted or manmade tobacco.  So this would be the stems and the stalks that used to be tossed away.  They would grind those up and reconstitute them and use them.

Tobacco that's not sold, it dries out on the shelf, that's not tossed away.  That comes back to the factory and is recycled and used, and they put it through an extraction process and take out the sort of all the water soluble chemicals, which include nicotine. So they have an extraction method to take nicotine out, coloring out of it.  They're left with a white slurry.

Same process using -- used to make a piece of paper, by the way.  Reconstituted tobacco, 3M holds patents for it.  So it's certainly the same methodology.

And then companies put things back.  So one of the ways to put less tobacco in, make sure you get the right dose, is to put back the nicotine in a uniform way over that sheet that's reconstituted tobacco.

And so as the companies started to lower the amount of tobacco actually in the rot, they would add in recon because it would allow them to control more precisely nicotine dosing.  So they wouldn't go below that minimum amount.  Because you can't really control precisely the nicotine in a tobacco plant just by

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=66
1435

blending it together.

You can control how you grow it.  And I mentioned genetic engineering through cross hybridization.  So they have plants that have high levels nicotine and lower, and you can control through that.

But in this blending process, when you look at one part of the leaf to the next in a natural plant you'll get a lot of variability.  So in order to maintain uniformity in the product, those are the things that really came in in the '50s.

A lot of additives were put in to facilitate easy inhalation.  So they -- you know, all kinds of additives, over 600, are used in making cigarettes today.

Q.   Let me ask you about that for a second, Dr. Cummings. A.   Sure.

Q.   You had mentioned inhalability a few times now. What is significant about inhalability?

A.   It makes a drug more addictive.  So any drug, by the way.  It's a way of delivering the drug more rapidly.

If you have asthma, by the way, you don't want to take a pill.  You want to get it in an inhaler.  So

it gets into your lungs rapidly, affects it so that drug can work to open up your airways.

Same is true with nicotine.  Wear a nicotine patch, about two hours to get the nicotine levels up in your blood and really doesn't give you a kick or anything.  Just, you know, give you a little nicotine at very slow delivery, relatively speaking.

Inhaling cigarette smoke where you have millions of particles of tar and nicotine that go into your airway � your airway is a large surface area about the size of a tennis court.  Your mouth, the cigar smoker, they get the surface area of a tennis ball because you get the smoke, hold it -- holding in your mouth.  So much smaller, less absorption, and so it's lower delivery of nicotine actually to the brain.

So if you can get it in your lungs, it gets rapid delivery to the brain, and the reinforcing chemicals that are in nicotine that release various neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin and other things, you know, hit the brain rapidly, and the fast delivery of a reinforcing drug increases the abuse liability, the addictive potential of that drug.  So inhalation is the key.

You take inhalation out of the equation, tobacco can be addictive, but a lot less addictive.  And

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=68
1437

so that's why cigarettes are such a lethal form of tobacco.

Q.   Can you compare the inhalability of the modern cigarette to cigarettes that were rolled, say, 4, 5, 600 years ago?

A.   Sure.  I mean, Burley tobacco, not -- not very well inhaled, as I pointed out.  That's why Burley tobacco wasn't very popular in cigarettes.

It's got a lot of nicotine in it, but, you know, because it's so harsh because of the high pH of the smoke, it's difficult to inhale.

Turkish tobacco is a little milder.  So it can be inhaled, but has generally low nicotine.  So it was really the addition of bright flue-cured to the blend that made the product more addictive, and that's why all the companies followed, because that increased their sales.  And after Camel was introduced, you can see a rapid increase in lung cancer that begins to take place about 10 to 15 years later.

MR. CLARK:  May I confer with counsel for a second, Your Honor?

MS. YATES:  I apologize, Your Honor.

I've just been handed a note about an exhibit and a video and it's not in the preadmit list, and we're trying to figure out if we have an objection or not and what it is.

MR. CLARK:  It's on our exhibit list, but I've decided -- this a video that shows the manufacturing process of Marlboro Lights.  In light of some of the things that Dr. Cummings just testified about, I've decided I'm going to go ahead and try and introduce this.  And the reason I consulted with counsel was to see if they had an objection, if I could go ahead and move it or if we needed to argue something.

If they need some time to look at it, I think they know what this exhibit is.  We've used it before, but if they need a couple of minutes, and I'll move on.  And we can -- they can tell me if they have an objection in a couple of minutes.

MR. CLARK:  Get myself back where I was, Your Honor.  Give me a second.

THE COURT:  That's fine. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   All right.  Dr. Cummings, you mentioned that Camel was the first American blended cigarette that hit the market in 1913.  Was there any promotional activities or any promotion marketing that went along with that?

A.   Sure.  You know, well, certainly, there was a lot of promotion that went along with Camel.  It became, you know, the best-selling cigarette pretty rapidly at the time.  And then was mimicked by the other companies, as I mentioned.

American Tobacco introduced Lucky Strike, and then Chesterfield reformulated its product.  And those brands dominated and cigarette advertising, as sales went up.  I mean, mass marketing of cigarettes really became important.

Of course, it was affiliated with men taking up smoking. They primarily chewed tobacco and used cigars, but they went off to World War I.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object.  I think we're beyond the call of the question. THE COURT:  I'll sustain that. BY MR. CLARK:

question.  Do you see kind of ales there roughly around

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=73
1442

1917?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you explain what that increase is from?

A.   Well, it's largely because they started to put the cigarette packs in K-rations and C-rations of the soldiers that had gone into World War I.  And cigarettes were packaged in a way that made them more convenient to use than sending cigars and chewing tobacco.  It often got moldy going over in ships to the soldiers.

So the soldiers largely came back from World War I addicted to cigarettes, and so that's why we see this increase in lung cancer rates in men that predate women in the high rates of lung cancer.  We now see in women sort of catching up to men, but they started smoking cigarettes in large numbers about a decade and a half later.

So men came back, they were the cigarette smokers.  And, you know, basically in the late '20s, early '30s, they started to market heavily to women, and women took up smoking just like the men had.  And, you know, you see a similar parallel increase when you look at lung cancer rates in women as well.

Q.   All right.  Can you -- can you explain why there's this gap between the cigarette sales and the increase in lung cancer?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=74
1443

A.   Sure.  Dose makes a difference.  So, you know, smoking one cigarette's not going to cause lung cancer. Smoking two.  But, you know, if you get a couple of decades worth of cigarette smoking under your belt, then your risk really goes up.  So �

Q.   How about you smoke cigarettes for two or three years, even a pack a day?

A.   Probably not much of a risk in terms of lung cancer as long as you don't go back to smoke again. So -- so dose makes a difference.

Duration of smoking is one of the measures of -- of that risk.  And so lung cancer tends to occur as you get older, and if you've had exposure to cigarette smoking over decades, you see that.

And there's about a 10 to 15-year lag.  So they call this a lag time in epidemiology.  And you see that for many chronic diseases, because chronic diseases don't occur immediately after an exposure.  It takes years and decades to see these exposures result in diseases, which is why it took a while to really figure out the evidence.

But the evidence started to appear in medical journals.  Late 1920s, all of a sudden doctors are saying, Well, why we seeing all this lung cancer in men? And, you know, speculation began to appear that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=75
1444

maybe cigarette smoking was the cause.  There were a lot of other theories as well.  Industrialization, air pollution, those kinds of things were mentioned as well.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object to the narrative.

MR. CLARK:  I was about to ask another question, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Move on.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   At the turn of the century, do you know roughly how many cases of lung cancer there were in the United States?

A.   Sure.  At the beginning of the 20th Century, around 1900, there were less than 200 cases of lung cancer in the entire United States.

Today, there are 160,000 lung cancers diagnosed every year.  It's a big change.  It's an epidemic. That's what we call an epidemic.

And every year, really from the beginning of the modern cigarette, every decade after, we began to see more lung cancer every decade, and that's why there has been such a focus on cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer.

Q.   Did they also put cigarettes in the rations

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=76
1445

during World War II?

A.   They did, yes.

And the Vietnam War.  Stopped after Vietnam.

Q. Before I get too far, I want to talk just real quickly about nicotine. If you can explain to the jury briefly what is nicotine.

A.   Well, nicotine is an alkaloid.  It's the active ingredient in tobacco that causes people to persist in using it day in and day out for decades.  And it affects the brain.

So addiction is a -- a brain disease.  It's known as a chronic relapsing brain disease.  It's characterized by compulsive use.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object.  I think

we're now beyond what is nicotine.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  You

may continue.

THE WITNESS:  It's characterized by compulsive

use and use despite knowledge of harm.  That's

characterize of an addictive substance in nicotine.

As I pointed out earlier, is the substance in

tobacco that causes addiction. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   How long has it been generally known that nicotine is in tobacco?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=77
1446

A.   Probably the early part of the 1900s, around 1820 or so.  I think nicotine had been isolated from tobacco.

Q.   And based on your review of internal documents, have you formulated any opinions as to the extent of the knowledge that the defendants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris and the other cigarette manufacturers had regarding nicotine?

A.   Sure.  Yes, I have.

Q.   And can you explain to the jury what that opinion is?

A.   The opinion is right from their own internal business documents where they basically say they had deep knowledge of the nicotine addiction and the reason why people smoked, that existed well before the published literature really began to document the reason why people find it hard to quit.  And they used that information in the engineering of their products.

So you can find documents in the early '60s. Brown & Williamson was doing research in the late 1950s. Very sophisticated animal studies, as well as human clinical studies, where they conclude as a result of that that they're in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.

Q.   Let me ask you this, Dr. Cummings --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=78
1447

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- have you seen documents -- well, strike that.

You testified that during the process to make reconstituted tobacco, they actually removed the nicotine out?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Have you seen documents, internal industry documents, that reflect how long they've had the ability to remove nicotine?

A. Sure. There are patents that go back into the '20s for removing nicotine from tobacco through various abstraction methods.  So you can find those patents.

They're literally a thousand or so patents that I've accumulated dating back to the '20s on issues related to nicotine control in cigarettes, from how you grow the tobacco plant to bioengineering the plant.  In other words, you know, inserting various proteins into tobacco that block the uptake of nicotine so you can generate seed and grow tobacco naturally without nicotine in it.  So I'm quite familiar with, you know --the information goes back to the '20s.

Q.   Are you familiar with a document from the 1935 American Tobacco regarding denicotinized cigarettes?

A.   Yes.  The Light Smoke.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

Q.   Have you reviewed that document before? A.   Sure.

MR. CLARK:  Plaintiff moves PT 2809 into evidence.  I believe this will be No. 2. THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. CARTER:  No further objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  This will be admitted into evidence as Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 2.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 2 admitted in evidence.)

MR. CLARK:  We'll publish this to the jury, Your Honor. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And this is titled "Improving the Taste and Character of Cigarette Tobacco With a View to Removing" -- is that -- I can't read it. Can you tell? A.   I can't read it from here.  I can tell you that.

Q.   Looks like "irritants," but I'm not sure.  "A Light Smoke."  All right.

I want to read this for a little bit, if you don't mind, Dr. Cummings. A.   Sure. Q.   "And in the cigarette, women, as well as men,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=80
1449

found a more convenient, more inexpensive, and more widely palatable form of -- palatable form of indulgence.  But probably the greatest single influence on the growth of cigarette consumption has been the dissipation of the ancient prejudice against tobacco in this particular form, and a growing belief that cigarettes being milder than other forms of tobacco smoking are less injurious."

"Controlling nicotine content. It is quite possible to denicotinize a cigarette by chemical and thermal methods."

In your field, what is meant by the word denicotinize?

A.   To remove nicotine.

Q.   "The makers of Lucky Strike cigarettes deliberately refrain from this because such removal of nicotine produces an emasculated cigarette shorn of those very qualities which give a cigarette character and appeal."

Who is the manufacturer of Lucky Strikes? A.   That's American Tobacco.  They're the author of this document.

Q.   And what is the state of the American Tobacco today?

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, cumulative of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

stipulation.  That was published. THE COURT:  Overruled. You may � you may proceed.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  They were acquired today by R.J. Reynolds, originally by Brown & Williamson. Brown & Williamson acquired by R.J. Reynolds.  So --

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, before we move away from this document, I'd ask under the rule of completeness for the paragraph No. 1 that's not highlighted to be published. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Certainly.

"Such removal of nicotine cannot be secured without affecting adversely certain other desirable taste constituents.  On the other hand, rigid control of nicotine content is a absolute prerequisite for a genuinely satisfactory cigarette."

And what was the year of this? A.   This is 1936. Q.   American Tobacco, right? A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, staying in this time period, 1920s, 1930, based on your education, your training, your experience, including your review of the previously secret documents, you formed opinions as to whether or not

Why don't you go ahead and read this for us, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Sure, you know.  "Give every school a good working just as quick as possible after it opens, doing trade building, work in accordance with the present plans and policies.  Line up the leaders of the most popular students.  In other words, get off to a good start just as quick as you can, and then keep up the work at regular intervals."

Q.   What's the date of this?

A.   It's 1927, September, school days starting again.  It's the beginning of the school year.

Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look at the other one.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, before we leave that

document -- yeah.  Before we leave the last exhibit,

may I have the second paragraph published, please?

"Your list."

THE COURT:  Yes, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Your list may include some schools at which you will not be permitted to do trade building work, particularly women's schools, and perhaps there are others.  At any rate, we want you to be careful not to

please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And the date of this one is 1928?

A.   Yes.

Q.   "Regular school is over.  Summer school is starting.  Most all high schools, prep schools, colleges and universities have finished the spring term.  And summer schools are now getting under way.  This means that thousands" -- sorry -- "this means that thousands of special students and teachers, both men and women, will be assembled at various places during the summer months."

"Please get started in this work at once.  Get your men intensely interested in lining up these students for our brands, both as consumers and boosters. And see to it that the stores and stands near the schools have a good supply of our product -- our products."

Now, over the next day or two, are we going to see additional documents that reflect on the defendant's efforts to market to children?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Based on your research regarding the cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=85
1454

industry and particularly these two defendants, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, did at any point in time over the course of the 20th Century, did they ever publicly acknowledge that they promoted cigarettes to children?

A.   No, they did not.  They denied that they marketed to kids or studied the smoking habits of kids. That's been a consistent statement from the cigarette companies, the defendants, as well as their spokespeople from the Tobacco Institute.

Q.   And how long -- strike that.

Are we going to see documents from later on in the 19 -- in the 20th Century that reflect on the industry's use of research in order to target children?

A.   Yes, they engineered products for kids.  They engineered their campaigns to appeal to young people. They replaced their products in places where young people would see them and be attracted to them.

They made sure that you could see cigarettes back in the day in the movies with movie stars and athletes and so on.  And later, you saw that repeated in product placements in movies today, like movies like Superman and other movies where you see product placements.  And those didn't happen just by accident. MR. CLARK:  We'll pick up with the advertising

MR. CARTER:  I have a quick question, Your Honor.  I noticed during Dr. Cummings' testimony at one point he was referring to some notes.  I was just wondering if I could be told what it is he has with him on the stand.

MR. CLARK:  I'm happy to get them.  I believe it's his notes from his deposition --

MR. CARTER:  Okay.

MR. CLARK:  -- that he attaches to an exhibit, but I'm happy to let him look at them.

MR. CARTER:  If they're the same as his depo notes, I don't need them.

MR. BIGGER:  Just one issue, Judge.  Maybe we can take it up in the morning, obviously.  I spoke with Mr. Geise about this a moment ago, over a moment ago now.  But during opening statement, Mr. Geise made some suggestion about --

MR. BIGGER:  For the record, the witness is out of the courtroom.

Just a question, during Mr. Geise's opening, he made an allusion or a reference to the idea that there may be potentially impeachment or an effort to impeach or cross-examine witness with a legal document, I think was the way it was referred to, something about the timing of their opinions in the legal document.

I asked Mr. Geise about that.  I think what I understand that to be is the witness disclosure, the expert witness disclosure, I believe is the legal document he was referring to.

Obviously, first things first.  If there is an effort to do that at some point, certainly don't do

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=89
1458

it without proffering or without us having an opportunity to be heard on it, number one.

Number two, that's why I'm raising it now.  I can see about 17 different problems with that.  So I'm trying to figure what they intend to do and what it is so there's not going to be any grounds for a mistrial, because an expert witness disclosure is drafted by lawyers, not by the witnesses themselves. It's not like a party's interrogatories.

So some suggestion there's some impropriety with the disclosure or how the disclosure was done is effort to expunge the reputation of the lawyers in the case and not anyone else.  So I don't want that to happen.

THE COURT:  Response.

MR. GEISE:  We'll look at the � we'll look at the issue tonight, and if we want to address it more fully in the morning.  I think, Your Honor, one of the issues here is a number of experts were disclosed.  And when I asked about the disclosure in their deposition, they said, yes, that is my opinions.  But it turns out they actually were not even retained in the cases until after their disclosure.

So part of the depositions with at least two

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=90
1459

witnesses walked through:  Are these the opinions you intend to offer?

Yes.

Did you have those opinions formed as of the date we were told that you were admitted?

They said no.

We walked through with them on when they formed their opinions, when they received documents, when they received materials on which they base their opinions.  So there's chronology there.  And I haven't thought much about the issues.  I was listening to Dr. Cummings' testimony this afternoon instead of thinking ahead on this.

But, you know, one of the things this could go to bias, this could go to cross-examination, this could go to impeachment.  There are a number of things it could go to.

I haven't thought ahead as to what exactly we'll do on it.  I know that both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Drobes in their depositions admitted pretty clearly that their opinions were disclosed in this case before they were retained or had any information about the plaintiff or the decedent.

So in terms of, you know, a bias and Dr. Cummings testifying at 90 of these different

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=91
1460

case, I think it goes to how much -- how much detail and study he goes into forming his opinions if they can be disclosed long before he knows something about a person.  If he wants to say, I don't know anything about the disclosure, I didn't do it, it's not mine, I don't know why they would say that, I wait until I form my opinion, that's fine.

And I think in terms of how they're forming their opinions, when they're getting materials, what they're basing it on, that's part of what could be used.

We'll look at it more tonight, but, you know, if there's an ongoing concern about an area of cross-examination here, we can cross that before we actually do something with the disclosure, if we even do something with the disclosure.

I'm not saying we would.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I would ask or rule that you shall provide that as a proffer before you go there, if you go there.  And we can approach the bench and request at that time.

MR. BIGGER:  Just, if what I'm hearing now there's a possibility they may not go there, it was a point made in opening statement.  So I just -- I think -- that just makes -- I apologize.  I'm not

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=92
1461

trying to be frustrated.  But if you have something
		
like that, you don't say it in opening statement if
		
you're not going
		to use it.  That's what this whole

thing rolls around.
		
I 'm
	fine.
	I appreciate that by Mr. Geise, and

we'11 see what t
		hey have to say on the issue, I

guess, tomorrow.

	Okay.

MR.

	Your Honor, one thing.  I don't

know if we can do it off the record.  I think both
		
sides had an issue with the exhibit numbering.  We
		
have �
	
	

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=93
1462

MR. BIGGER:  Not an issue.  A question.

MR. GEISE:  -- a question.  Something to raise. I know we have different exhibit numbers like Mr. Clark is referring to it and then we were like, that's Exhibit 3.  I just want to make sure before we go into however more exhibits we have with Dr. Cummings that we have the procedure down.  So that we're not renumbering things later on and trying to keep track of it.  I want to make sure everybody knows that before we -- we're going have a lot more exhibits tomorrow, is my guess.

THE COURT:  My understanding was that you were going to list them for identification purposes alphabetically, and then when they're admitted, be numerically on a sequential basis.

MR. BIGGER:  I think the concern probably for everybody who knows, that there may be appellate lawyers who are going to -- these two, maybe others that are going to get very frustrated with us if --if there is any possible way with the record, exhibit number could be the PT number or the AS or AI number, whatever it might be, just because it just makes it so much easier when we're trying to prepare the record in these cases and record arguments, things like that.  And if it's easiest

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=94
1463

for your clerk to have something for her purposes as 1, 2, 3, 4, whatever, that's perfectly fine.

And we can have someone here take down and give her a list, give you a list at the end of the day of all the documents that his Honor moved into evidence, agreed upon by the parties, here it is, whatever we can do to make it easier for you, is perfectly fine with us.  But I think we've had that experience, both of us probably, in other trials where there's a new number that was used.  And just -- I've had my appellate lawyers really be not happy with me when that happens.  So I'm just trying to avoid that.  And the records get big.

MR. CLARK:  And I would much rather just use the PT numbers or the numbers that it's there.  I'd much rather use those that we've assigned for that reason, but I apologize if I assumed too much.  But I thought we would -- I thought I would move, identify it on the record, and then what the clerk's next sequential number would be.

But my preference would be to use the PT number as the exhibit number, if that's acceptable to the clerk and the Court.

THE CLERK:  I just need to check in our system here, what I have to log it, if I'm able to use this

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=95
1464

letter and this is a seven-digit identification code so letters and numbers.  I want to make sure it takes it here.  And if it does, it would take it either -- I could use it for the ID and for the evidence numbers.  I just need to check it.  So --

THE COURT:  Okay.  If you could check on that.

THE CLERK:  Yeah.  It's going to take me a little bit.

THE COURT:  And perhaps we can address it tomorrow morning.

MR. BIGGER:  We can collaborate on that. Whatever we do, we'll collaborate on that.  We'll have some way to do the numbers.  Whatever's the easiest thing we can do for you to allow us to not have heartburn would be great.

THE CLERK:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  I'm flexible, that's fine.

MR. BIGGER: I mean, we'll deal with it at the end of the day, whatever Your Honor needs us to do. We're happy to help facilitate that process. Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else?

All right.  We'll see you tomorrow morning.

PROCEEDINGS

(Court called to order at 8:57 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Good morning.

ALL PARTIES:  Good morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You may be seated.

Okay.  Are we ready to proceed with Mr. -- or Dr. Cummings?

MR. BIGGER:  Could we just have a moment, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BIGGER:  What we're trying to do is, we did the pre-admit list.  There were written objections that were made for preservation purposes and were overruled.  I want to just get everything that was on that pre-admit list where the written objections were made for preservation and overruled.  We wanted to move that into evidence.  I want to identify what those PT numbers are.  That will help expedite the process during the witness's testimony so we're not having to, you know, move each � it saves a few, you know, seconds, but it adds up over a cumulative period of time.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's fine.

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, just for clarity purpose, we don't object to those, but there may be

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=103
1472

some portions we ask be redacted before they go back to the jury room.  We just want to make sure that's clear on the record.

MR. BIGGER:  You're talking about reference to Shook Hardy?

MR. THORNE:  Or there may be -- there were some other maybe potentially inflammatory things were in there that we discussed with the Court previously. We just want to make sure that those don't go back there.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.  And that's fine.  If it's something that's consistent with the Court's prior rulings, absolutely.  Just let me know which ones they are.

MR. THORNE:  We'll do that.

THE COURT:  I know we're a ways away, but I want both sides -- or all three sides to make sure that they go through all the evidence before it hits the jury room to make sure there aren't any questions there.  Okay?

MR. CLARK:  All right.

MS. CHERRY:  Judge, can I address -- we had talked yesterday we were going to be marking of exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  And I spoke with Madame Clerk this morning.  She confirmed

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=104
1473

that we would be able to use each respective party's identification codes, so that the exhibit is going to be marked for identification, and if admitted into evidence, it will be received as the same identification number --

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. CHERRY:  � instead of, you know, 1, 2, 3, 4.  So just for record purposes, we moved into evidence Plaintiff's 1, 2, 3, and 4 yesterday.  And those are going to be changed so that it will be the same number that they were marked for identification.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That will be admitted into evidence as noted.  I may make that exact same ruling when you admit it.  If it's PT18 -- you know, whatever.  If I don't write it down, just bear with me, but �

MS. CHERRY:  No problem.

THE COURT:  � we'll deal with that.

MS. CHERRY:  We'll keep track and check with the clerk, as well.

THE COURT:  All right.

MS. CHERRY:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  And I am not working here.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor �

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=105
1474

THE COURT:  Hang on.  We're having technical difficulties here.

(Off the record.)

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, yesterday there was a Philip Morris manufacturing video that was not on the pre-admit.  I just said I would go and look at it and see if I had any objections.  I believe it's Plaintiff's Exhibit 4581A.  And it's a 17-minute video.

Overall, I have no objections.  Ten minutes into the video, you see these big vats of urea acid, and they're talking about additives to cigarettes. And what concerned me is that Dr. Cummings, in the past, has described urea acid as "Urea is a protein, uric acid, also found -- most people think of urea in urine, but they're not getting it from urine; it's manufactured urea that they use, but it is added as a pH modifier in some brands of cigarettes."

Well, there is no need to throw in the gratuitous statement about most people think about urine, because it's not coming from that.

So I have a 403 objection.  The witness, if the video is not cut at the ten minutes and the vats

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=106
1475

come in where they're adding the additive,

Dr. Cummings should be instructed there's no reason

to make that gratuitous inflammatory comment.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you have any problem instructing him?

MR. BIGGER:  We'll tell him, that's fine.

No.  No.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  "Don't say the word urine."  How's that?  That's what I'll tell him.

MS. YATES:  Thank you.

MR. BIGGER:  With the documents on the pre-admit list, what we've decided to do is, by agreement of the parties, all the written objections that they made, those documents, those have been preserved and overruled.

To the extent that the documents are those that will be used this morning, we're going to identify them by PT number, not formally move them into evidence, and take a moment to do that and just roll through the documents that way so they can hear the PT number, make sure it's there.  And then at lunch, we'll identify and, you know, move all those into evidence that were identified with the jury in the morning and then take up the other ones where there

KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., plaintiff's witness herein, being previously duly sworn on oath, testified as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, yesterday when we left off, we talked a little bit about youth marketing and said that we would get into some advertising.

Right before we get into the advertising, though, I'd like to ask you -- I think we touched on it briefly, but what year did John Barbose turn 15 years of age?

A.   He was born in 1934, so let's see, 15 --

Q.   About '4 9?

A.   1949, 1950, somewhere in that range.

Q.   Okay.  And what brand of cigarettes was he smoking, according to his brother when he was 15 years of age?

A.   His brother said he was smoking Philip Morris.

Q.   Where was he getting those from?

A.   His father's grocery store.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=110
1479

Q.   And moving into the '50s, what brands was he smoking?

A.   Well, he smoked a variety of brands, but Camel, Lucky Strike early on, and then Marlboro.  His brother recalls him smoking Marlboro, I think, at his high school graduation, as I recall from the testimony.  And then later, Marlboro Lights, Winston.  So in the '50s, it would have been Camel, Lucky Strike.

Q. And how popular was Camel, Lucky Strikes, and Philip Morris cigarettes to teenagers and young men at the time?

A.   They were the most popular brands in the early '50s.  A Philip Morris survey, 1953, identified top brands among 15-year-olds.  Lucky Strike was No. 1, Camel was No. 2.  I think Philip Morris was a little lower.  But, you know, it was in the top ten in terms of popular brands among teenagers at that time.

Q.   And how did those brands become so popular?

A.   Well, advertising was the main effect.  They were -- had lots of marketing of Camel and Lucky Strike cigarettes.  He had the Lucky Strike Hit Parade.  He had Philip Morris cigarettes advertised on television; I Love Lucy, which was � television was just coming in in the '50s; you know, marketing through movie stars and celebrities.  Baseball teams were sponsored by cigarette

companres.

It was part of the American culture, sort of a rite of passage for most young men and women, actually, in the '50s and '60s to take up smoking.

Q.   Now, that's something you've referred to in the past as the normalization?

A.   Yeah, normalization.  You know, the marketing of it was like wallpaper.  It was everywhere. Cigarettes were the most heavily-advertised consumer product in history.  Between 1940 and 2005, the industry spent over $250 billion in marketing.  And so it dominated and you'd see it everywhere.  It was on billboards.  You'd go into stores, you would see it.  It was in the movies.  Back before television, you know, the trailers for the movies were cigarette ads that you would see.

And the stars in the movies were often co-marketing their movie with the cigarette brand.

Q.   And how did the advertising of cigarettes compare to advertising of other consumer products during that era?

A.   As I said, it was the most heavily-advertised consumer product.  You had cars -- it was pretty heavily marketed.  And then, obviously, consumer products from Procter & Gamble, they were also, you know, heavily

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=112
1481

marketed as well.  But cigarettes were number one, actually.

And, particularly, when television came in in the '50s, they dominated the three channels, you know, basically sponsoring many of the television shows that were popular growing up at that time.

Q.   Why don't we go ahead and take a look at some. We have some video and some print ads, right? A.   Yes. Q.   Let's take a look at some.

MR. CLARK:  This will be PT513A, for the record.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"The makers of Camels have sent more than 210 million gift Camels to the members of our armed forces and hospitalized veterans.  This week, free Camels go to veterans' hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky; and Erie, Pennsylvania; U.S. Army Station Hospital, Tooele, Utah; U.S. Naval Hospital, Pensacola, Florida; and the Military Air Transport Service which evacuates virtually all of our overseas sick and wounded personnel."

Shall we just have a cigarette on it?

Yes.

May I sometimes come to you?

Whenever you like.  It's your home, too."

(The video clip concluded.)

MR. CLARK:  5 4 7A.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"Thanks."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, who were some of these people in the clips we just watched?

A.   Well, they indicate who they are.  Humphrey Bogart, obviously, was a well-known movie star, probably the most famous movie star at the time, and Lauren Bacall.  They also advertised cigarettes for the company.  So you would see them in the movies, but you would also see them in print ads and billboards for cigarettes as well.

Q.   Did movies like what we just saw, is that part of the process that resulted in the normalization of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=114
1483

cigarette culture?

A.   Yes.  I mean, the massive amounts of marketing associating it with popular people of the day, the movie stars, the athletes, people in the military.  Certainly, in the '40s, that was a big theme, you know, help normalize smoking, make it a part of a normal thing.

It was normal to smoke.  It was really sort of abnormal not to smoke, you know.  And just to see how common it was back then, you know, if you went to school, you were making ashtrays for Mom and Dad for, you know, Mother's and Father's Day.  It was common to give gift cartons of, you know, cigarettes at holiday. And so it's very different today, obviously.

But you have to understand the culture in which Mr. Barbose grew up in and became a smoker, it was a normal thing to do.

Q.   And you mentioned it, so let's look.  We have a slide here.  This is 499 of movie and television stars? MR. CLARK:  PT499.  Pull up a couple of these,

please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who is that one in the top left?

A.   It's John Wayne.

Q.   And he also promoted Camels in his films as well?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=115
1484

A.   Yes.  And sometimes you'd see, particularly in the '50s, he'd talk about, you know, doing films.  And then it was an ad for Camel cigarettes and talked how mild they were and not irritating on his throat.  That was a theme that you saw for Camel.  And a lot of brands, actually, in this period of late '40s, early '50s.

MR. CLARK:  PT577A.  Now �

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:) "Lucy. Yes, dear?

Get me a cigarette, will you? Don't say cigarette.  Say Philip Morris. Oh, is there any other kind?

Thank you.  Lucy, you're so good to me. You see how easy it is to keep a man happy? Why not give your husband a carton of Philip Morris cigarettes.

Smart move.  He'll love them with their mildness, their smoothness, and their wonderful good taste.  And he'll love you, too, for thinking of him.

That's right.  Good night, everybody.  And

don't forget, call for Philip Morris. Call for Philip Morris." (The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Two questions about that one.  Just in case anybody doesn't know, who are the two stars on that show?

A.   Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz.  And, of course, this is in the early '50s when their show came on television, one of the most popular shows on TV.  And this is an example of how cigarette advertising was sort of integrated with the stars of the show.  Other products, also.  So, I mean, it wasn't uncommon to see other products where the stars were pitching the products, but very common with cigarettes.  And cigarettes really dominated in television.

Q.   And who is this that we see on the screen right now?

A.   That's Johnny Ravenal.  He was the spokesperson for Philip Morris back in the '40s.  He would make appearances in movie theaters.  And they would have the trailers call for Philip Morris.  And he became, actually, a celebrity.  And they had a number of Johnny Ravenals that would appear, actually around the country,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=117
1486

at movie theaters and so on.  His famous call for Philip Morris became known with that particular brand.

Q.   Now, you said that cigarette advertising also used famous athletes at the time?

A.   Yes.

Q.   We have a slide showing some of those as well?

A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  And this is going to be PT498.

Let's highlight a couple of those, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who do we have here?

A.   You've got Joe DiMaggio and a variety of other, I think, baseball players in this particular ad.  So, you know, it was very common to see the most popular athletes of the day.  And they were smokers, because smoking was, you know, very common.

You're talking about smoking prevalence rates among men that were -- you know, in the early '50s was close to 60 percent.  It was about, you know, high 50s in terms of prevalence of current smokers.  Pretty common among women but lower, about 36 percent.

And so athletes smoked, doctors smoked.  Half of all doctors were cigarette smokers in the early '50s. And so Joe DiMaggio here for Camel cigarettes, and many other athletes.  You know, Joe Louis, a fighter, you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=118
1487

know, advertised cigarettes.  Babe Ruth.  You had Willie Mays .

The New York Giants used to be marketing Marlboro cigarettes.  The MVP award in the NFL in the early '60s was the Marlboro MVP award.

Q.   Would that be similar to today, say the Kansas City Royals, who just won the World Series, promoting a brand of cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What were some of the themes that cigarette advertising would use in its -- well, strike that. Worded that wrong.

Can you identify some of the themes used in cigarette advertising?

A.   Well, there were a number of themes.  One of the key themes for the brands were that they were mild, less irritating to your throat, easy to inhale.  Another theme was, you know, with athletes using the products that you could, you know, be an athlete and smoke and it wouldn't get your wind because this product is better than our competitor's product.  Fun, sexy.  You know, it was a rite of passage.  Cigarette smoking was viewed as something to aspire to, and the leading figures of the day were used in the marketing by the cigarette companies to promote cigarettes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=119
1488

So that's what the -- that's the world Barbose grew up in.  I mean, that was the way cigarettes really were portrayed.  They weren't portrayed as something that's going to make you sick and dead.

Q.   In case I missed it, holidays, was that a theme?

A.   Holiday themes, yeah.  As I mentioned, it was very common.  You have Mother's and Father's Day promotions that were done.  Particularly around Christmas, of course you'd have Santa.  And the gift packs and the cartons often came in holiday packaging with a wreath or, you know, Christmas scenes.

Q.   Santa Claus?

A. Right. And it was very common at that time, you know, for gifts to be given. I think these are from the '30s with Camel. But, you know, you could see these kinds of themes actually going up into the '60s. And it was very common for people to give cartons of cigarettes or ashtrays or other cigarette lighters and cigarette paraphernalia as gifts.

MR. CLARK:  And that was PT503 � for the

record, 503C.

We also have a video for Camel that's PT4651A,

if we could play that.

(The video clip was published to the jury in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

open court as follows:)

"Cartons of Camels are sure to please. Besides, they look so handsome under Christmas trees.  So easy to give, so good to get.  Give Camels, the nation's favorite cigarette.  Ho, ho, ho.  In gift packs ready to give with a space for your greeting."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Military.  We're talking about the 1940s.  Was there advertising that was geared towards the war spirit or the American patriotism, anything like that?

A.   Sure.  As I mentioned, cigarettes were part of the culture in the military.  You didn't take a break if you were in the military unless you were taking a smoke break.  It's in the K rations and C rations of the soldiers, and it was also picked up in the marketing of tobacco products.  We saw the one television ad.  I think that was maybe at the end of the Sgt. Bilko Show in the '50s where they would talk about giving free cartons of cigarettes to the soldiers in the VA hospitals.  And in the '40s, it was certainly part of the war effort.  In fact, they changed the color of Lucky Strike packs because Lucky Strike went to war, because of the coloring.  It wasn't available for the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=121
1490

supplies because of their green pack.  So they went to the white pack in the 1940s as a result.

Q.   This will be -- this is PT -- we have a slide showing some military ads, PT498A.

And we're showing slides of many different advertisements and I'm just asking you to pick out one or two, but they're going to have all these ads back in the jury room with them.

Let's show a couple of these.

So what are we seeing here, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, all walks of the military, we want Camels, again, you know, talking about, you know, Camel cigarettes in marketing in the military.  I mean, you'd find these ads in some of the magazines that were actually sponsored and published by the military as well as in magazines.  And, you know, you want to be a hero, somebody in the military, and this was a good way to associate your brand, you know, with, you know, the war effort.  This is obviously World War II, but you see it also with the Korean War.

Q.   Was that a very popular slogan, "First In The Service"?

A.   Yes.  And of course it's also reflecting the fact that Camel's -- Camel and Lucky Strikes really dominated.  They were the most popular brands at the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=122
1491

time.  And a lot of young people were in the service.

Q.   And was John Barbose in the service?

A.   Yes.  He was in the Army, yeah.

Q.   And what time period was he in the Army?

A.   It was in the late 1950s.

Q.   So when World War II was going on, how --where's John Barbose?  Where is he living at at that time?

A.   He was living in Pennsylvania.

Q.   The Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the cigarette advertising that we've seen so far, is that representative of the cigarette advertising across the country at that time?

A.   Yeah, these were national ad campaigns.  So, you know, for the major brands, they were national ad campaigns and would appear in national magazines.  You can see that these are colored ads.  So a lot of ads are black and white, but often the ads for cigarettes would stand out because they were done in color.  They would often get the best, you know, places in a magazine, like the back cover of the magazine or the center fold of the magazine or the inside cover.  So you would see -- you would see these ads frequently in popular magazines like Look and Life and Saturday Evening Post.  And so they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=123
1492

were -- they were everywhere, like wallpaper basically. You couldn't escape cigarette advertising.

Q.   Is there anything that would exclude the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area from that wallpaper? A.   Not that I'm aware of.

MR. CARTER:  Can we approach very briefly?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

MR. CARTER:  I apologize for the interruption, but actually in the witness's deposition, he testified that he conducted no review of those papers and has never consulted them for any purpose. And so I'm concerned that that question was asked. And when the witness says, "Not that I know of," I think we should clear something up.  And I don't think this is something to wait to cross.  The witness obviously has no foundation for that.  I didn't expect him to answer that.

THE COURT:  Well, it sounds like something you can address in cross-examination, but -- do you have a response?

MR. CLARK:  That's exactly the point, Judge. They can address that on cross-examination.  He didn't render any opinions.  If they're trying to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=124
1493

make a Binger type of analysis, he didn't make any opinions on that.  What he's basically saying is, this was a national campaign and there is nothing about Wilkes-Barre that would have excluded it.  I mean, that's the end of it.  And that was the end of the inquiry anyway.  So �

MR. CARTER:  And my concern is it's hard -- the witness has no basis to say that there's nothing about Wilkes-Barre that would have been different when the witness has not conducted that analysis.

MR. CLARK:  It's a national campaign.  So he does have a basis to say that.

THE COURT: Okay. I would instruct you to ask the witness that question as to clear that up. But I think you've made your point.

MR. CLARK:  Yes, sir.

MR. CARTER:  So just ask has he reviewed Wilkes-Barre papers?

THE COURT: Right. I'll sustain the objection and instruct as to that.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge.

MR. CLARK:  I guess I was confused, Your Honor. I thought you had told me that that was a matter he could bring in cross-examination.

THE COURT:  Again, I don't have full knowledge

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=125
1494

of all the depositions in this case.  So I agree that it is a matter for cross-examination, but --but I think that his point is well-taken that if you would just follow up with the question specifically having kind of addressed it being that it's a national campaign, but that your question was that it wasn't specifically directed at --

MS. YATES:  He didn't research.

MR. CARTER:  I'm just concerned that the witness's answer leaves the jury with the impression that he has a basis for that statement beyond the fact it was a mere national campaign.

MR. CLARK:  And I think he does have the basis for that statement, and it doesn't mean that he has to identify the things that he did not do to reach that conclusion.  He can address, you know, the things like he said; this was a national campaign. It was everywhere.  It was like wallpaper.

THE COURT:  Pose that question to the witness. But you can also cross-examine on that.  I think that from here on out, it's something that needs to be addressed in cross-examination.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge.

MS. YATES:  Thank you.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   One point of clarification, Dr. Cummings.  In your review of materials for this particular case, did you review specific newspapers from the Wilkes-Barre area?

A.   No.

Q. Okay. But in your review of the rest of the information, have you reviewed industry documents and information from elsewhere?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did you find anything in the industry documents that would exclude the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area from this marketing campaign?

A.   No, I have not found anything that it was excluded.  And I have actually found internal business documents that do talk about, you know, placing advertising in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  So there are internal documents when you look at marketing plans and where they're doing some of their marketing, Wilkes-Barre is on the list of -- along with many other cities.

But when they're on liberty, it's every man for himself standing by for his favorite cigarette.  And Camels are America's favorite cigarette.  Yes, more people smoke Camels than any other brand.

B, and � 500 � 500A and 500B. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let's take a look at these.  How about the Lucky Strike ad down at the bottom.

A.   Sure.

Q.   What do we see in this Lucky Strike ad?

A.   Well, it's a physician.  They're talking about Lucky Strikes, a milder cigarette, toasted.  They're really sort of talking about flue-curing of tobacco, Lucky Strike.  This is from the 1930s, that particular ad.

Right next to it you can see Camel.  "More Doctors Smoke Camel Than Any Other Brand," that was an ad from the late '40s, early '50s, as part of a campaign that R.J. Reynolds was running.  And you saw a lot of these ads.  And you see them for other products as well.

Philip Morris had its, "Eminent Throat Doctors Say Philip Morris Is Mildest."  I think we may have a TV ad of that one.  But this was a very common theme among all of the cigarette manufacturers and they often used doctors, nurses, dentists to talk about what brand of cigarette they were smoking.  And it was very common actually for the doctors when they went to their medical meetings to have, you know, free packs of cigarettes

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

given out at the medical meetings and so on.

MR. CLARK:  543 A.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"What cigarette do you smoke?  You'll be interested to know how the doctors of America answered that question.  Tens of thousands of doctors, doctors in all parts of the country, in every state of the union, doctors in every branch of medicine were asked, 'What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?'  In this nationwide survey of general practitioners, surgeons, throat specialists, diagnosticians and so on, the brand named most was Camel.  Yes, according to this survey, more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.  Try Camels yourself.  Make the one sensible cigarette test. Make your own 30-day Camel mildest test in your T zone.  Smoke only Camels for 30 days.  Enjoy Camel's rich, full flavor and see how well Camels agree with your throat.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   You were about to say it, I think.  Do you know how this ad campaign, More Doctors Smoke Camels, came about?

A.   Sure.  Their internal business records talk about William Esty.  That's the advertising firm for R.J. Reynolds.  They make Camel cigarettes.  They did --you know, they went to the American Medical Association meeting.  They put free cartons of Camel cigarettes in the doctors' hotel rooms.  They waited a day for the doctors to use up their regular brand.  Then they sent their people outside the conferences.  The doctors were coming in the door and they asked them, Doctor, what brand of cigarettes do you have with you today?  More doctors smoke Camel than any other brand.  So that's how they actually came up with the advertising theme, which was quite successful by their own accounts.  And this is a theme that they ran from the late 1940s through the early 1950s.

"Because you will be smoking the one cigarette with a difference in manufacture, an important difference that avoids a common cause of cigarette irritation.

wonderful happen to you."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   In addition to commercials, print advertisements, cigarettes being displayed by movie stars and athletes in movies and things like that, what other forms of advertising were there regarding cigarettes?

A.   Well, there was billboards.  You know, basically during the '60s, '70s, and even into the early '80s, you found that almost half of all billboards in America for a cigarette brand, usually the leading, top-leading selling brands.  Point of sale, you go into a store, you would see sampling of products.  There was often free samples.  If you'd go to certain places back in the '50s and '60s, you would have airlines that would give you free, you know, sampler packs of cigarettes when you got on the airline.  Of course you could smoke pretty much anywhere you wanted, so smoking on the airline was common.  And so you'd see -- I think Winston actually co-branded with Piedmont Airlines at the time. And other airlines also had similar kind of co-marketing with cigarette companies.  So it was everywhere.

Product placements on television, I mentioned. Also movies.  That was very common.

MR. CLARK:  May I approach the witness,

Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let me hand you those.  Let me ask if you can identify those, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Sure.  These are different line extensions of Marlboro cigarettes.  You have Marlboro Red.  That's the regular brand.  You have a pack here -- obviously this is an older pack -- Marlboro Lights.  And then Marlboro Ultralights.

Q.   Is that part of cigarette advertising as well?

A.   Sure.  Packaging is an important part of the branding of a product and it is one of the ways you communicate information to consumers.  So you can see the difference.  Marlboro Lights came in in 1972 as a line extension.  You know, you have the Marlboro, by the way, which was remade in the mid 1950s, 1954, with its box, the flip-top box.  That was the innovation there. But as you can look at the different brands that I've got here, you can see the difference in the color of the chevron.  You know, the larger red chevron is known for Marlboro red or regulars.  When the lights came in, it's a different color, tan color or gold color, smaller, more white space on the pack.

Marlboro Lights.  This is a newer version of Marlboro Lights.  But the original Marlboro Lights also used to advertise lowered in tar and nicotine.  So that was the claim that they were making for Marlboro Lights, that you would get less tar and nicotine.

Then the ultra light product, which came in in the '90s, has got the -- still yet a smaller chevron, silver, more white space on the pack, all this designed to communicate to the consumer there was -- you were getting less, which turns out not to be the case. Q.   Now, has your research -- strike that.

All the ads we looked at, the movies, the commercials, product packaging, the billboards, everything you've mentioned, is that all representative of the cigarette advertising that John Barbose would have been exposed to when he was a teenager and a young man?

A.   Yes, all carefully researched and orchestrated. The packs are in particular carefully studied.  Then when you open up the packs, you'll see differences. This has got the cork color tip to the filter, and the lighter products have white tipping paper.  Putting white tipping paper doesn't make the cigarette safer or lower in tar, but consumers --

THE WITNESS:  � will perceive it that way. MR. CARTER:  � I object to the narrative beyond the question. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let me ask you about that.  If you can open up that pack of Marlboros for a second. A.   Sure.

MR. CLARK:  Sorry.  I didn't mean to approach, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  That's fine.  He's a man with a broken ankle. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   If you could show that to the jury.  So the filter paper there, the tipping paper, it's a cork-looking paper.  How does that differ from the Marlboro Lights?  I'm not going to ask you to open the Marlboro Light pack.

A.   Yeah.  The Marlboro Lights have the white color instead of the cork color.  That's very common with the products that purported to be lower in tar and nicotine. MR. CLARK:  I'd like to pass this around, let the jury see it a little bit closer. THE COURT:  All right. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

there, Dr. Cummings.  What were you saying about the Marlboro Light?

A.   Well, I mean, the packaging is important.  And then when � even when you open up the product, you see differences, that's all carefully researched.  When you see advertising for Marlboro Lights versus Marlboro Reds, even in the print advertising, the Marlboro Light cowboy often would have the rope next to his side and the Marlboro Red ads would have the rope up in the air, more action, all communicating less for the lights and more for the so-called full-flavored product. And so that was all carefully researched.  Nothing in cigarette advertising or design is done by accident. It's heavily researched.  So what happens as a consequence of that is the direct result of the manufacturer.

Q.   Let me ask you this question.  During your research, have you seen evidence as to what the industry actually expected from its advertising?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Who is Robert Heimann?

A.   Robert Heimann was the president of American Tobacco.  Lucky Strike, Pall Mall cigarettes.  He started out in sales, rose up the ranks and became the president of the company, a role which he served in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=137
1506

'60s and '70s.  As a result, he also served on the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research.

Q.   Before we see this clip, I want to make sure --I'm not sure if the jury is aware.

Can you briefly describe who those organizations are?  We already talked a little bit about the TIRC, I know.  But who is the Tobacco Institute, the CTR, and what was their relationship with each other? A.   Well, they're all interrelated.  They're all paid for by the major cigarette companies, and the payments to create the organizations came based on a share, their market share of the company.  So if you had -- you were the biggest seller, you paid the biggest share to those organizations.

TIRC, Tobacco Industry Research Committee, was created at a meeting at the Plaza Hotel in 1953, announced to the public in 1954.  And I think we'll go into more details about that.  But they were created purportedly to study the alleged relationship between smoking and disease and then provide factual information to the public.  That's what they said in their articles of incorporation.  They were housed in the Empire State Building in New York.  And they changed their name in 1964 to the Council for Tobacco Research.  So it's the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=138
1507

same organization.  They just did a name change in March of 1964.

The Tobacco Institute, that spun off of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee's communication committee.  They had a PR committee called the communications committee.  And in 1958, they spun that off.  They reduced the budget of TIRC by the amount of money that went into the Tobacco Institute to create it. It was to speak -- to do the public relations on behalf of the industry, particularly on issues related to smoking and health.  That organization existed -- it was out in 1958.  Their budget went up quite a bit more than TIRC, by the way, over their history.  Both organizations went out of business in 1998.

Q.   So is it Mr. Heimann or Dr. Heimann?

A.   Mister.

Q.   And I think you said he at one time was president of American Tobacco and he was on the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Are you familiar with a deposition he gave in December of '96 where he's addressing -- '86.  I'm sorry.

Q.   Are you familiar with a deposition he gave in 1986 regarding American Tobacco's position on cigarette advertising? A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  We'll play that, please.  That is 1691.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"Does advertising play a role in a person's selection of cigarette?

We hope so when we advertise.  It's difficult to confirm this, but we do make the effort and I think it's fair to assume that the expenditure of large funds for advertising does give status to a brand and, therefore, influences some people to select that brand.

Okay.  Is one of the objectives of advertising for cigarettes simply to put your advertising best foot forward and hope it will serve all purposes?

Yes.

It will attract new smokers and keep your level ones?

Exactly.

Okay.  Throughout your tenure with American, it was not only American's position but your position

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

that cigarettes weren't injurious to health; is that accurate?

Through my tenure?

Yes.

Yes, that is so.

That's something American Tobacco wanted the public to believe; is that correct?

Yes.

It's a statement that American Tobacco puts great reliance on?

We -- we issued that statement, yes.

And as far as --

I believe it.

As far as you're concerned, a person is justified in relying on that statement?

Yes. "

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, have you seen evidence in the internal documents where similar -- the position that Dr. Heimann just took was similar across the rest of the cigarette manufacturers regarding the expectations for consumers?

A.   Yes, that is exactly what the cigarette companies told consumers really from -- up until 2000 is -- in terms of the defendants here.  They didn't acknowledge that their products caused any harm to human health.  That was a consistent statement that you got from the Tobacco Institute until they were forced to go out of business in 1998.

Q.   And although Mr. Heimann there was -- the questions were referencing American Tobacco, what you just testified would also include Philip Morris as well, correct?

A.   That's right.  And those statements primarily came for the most part from the Tobacco Institute, because they were the spokespersons for the industry. So when you would hear statements coming from them, they were coming from their member organizations.  Their executive committee was made up of the presidents of all the cigarette manufacturers.

Q.   Let's go back to the '50s again.  Have you seen

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

A.   Ted Bates �

Q.   Who was Ted Bates?

A.   Yeah.  Ted Bates did advertising.  It was an advertising -- you know, an advertising company.  They did work primarily for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company now owned by R.J. Reynolds.  And he is reporting on a report that was prepared by Mr. Burgard that looked at cigarette advertising expenditures for different brands and themes for popular brands from the 1920s, '30s, '40s, up to 1953, and comments on the impact of cigarette advertising on sales.

Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is a summary of that particular research

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=143
1512

that was done, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   All right.  "The cigarette industry dramatically demonstrates the force of advertising in the United States today."

That was what year again?

A.   1953.

Q.   "We have millions of individual purchases every day of the year, and every consumer is presold, specifying his brand by name.  The rise and fall of every brand of consequence has been traced in detail and their year-to-year success or failure shown to be the direct result of consumer advertising." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   How old is John Barbose in 1953?

A.   Well, he would have been 19.  So in 1953, he's just graduated high school.

Q.   Now, staying in that 1953 timeframe -- and he was -- you say he was 18, 19 years old, I believe is what you said.

A.   Right.

Q.   Going back to the topic of youth marketing for a second, can you explain to this jury how youth marketing played a role in the business model of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=144
1513

industry?

A.   Absolutely critical.  It's part of the business model of the companies.  You've got to get -- you know, almost -- virtually no one takes up smoking after the age of 25.  Almost all tobacco initiation is between the ages of 12 and 25.  And so you've got to get them while they're young.  And most people experiment with cigarettes before the age of 18.  Not everybody goes on to become a regular smoker.  A lot of people try it and then don't go on.  But about a third of smokers who experiment will become regular daily smokers.  And almost all that experimentation occurs at a very young age.  The earlier you get exposed to nicotine, an addictive substance, the more likely it is you're going to alter your brain in a way that's going to make it hard to get off as an adult smoker.

MR. CLARK:  And this is PT2125. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who is George Weissman?

A.   He was an executive for Philip Morris.  In 1953, he was a special assistant to Parker McComas, who was the president of Philip Morris.  George Weissman is really credited for the reinvention of Marlboro cigarettes, which took it from a brand that had really been aimed at women to a brand that became, you know,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=145
1514

known with the flip-top box and the cowboy and so on. He's really the architect of that particular brand.  He was on the board of directors and a senior executive. But at this time, he had commissioned a large survey really --

Q.   Before you get to that, Dr. Cummings, Dr. Dupuis -- who was Dr. Dupuis?

A.   Dr. Dupuis was the director of research and development at Philip Morris.

Q.   This is October 7th, 1953?

A.   Right.

Q.   Let me read that for you.

"These general industry figures indicate that 47 percent of the population 15 years and older smoke cigarettes, divided into 58 percent of the male population and 36 percent of the female population."

Is that consistent with what we saw yesterday about the rise of lung cancer was becoming more of a male disease?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's go to -- let me read this highlighted portion for you real quick.

"Encouragingly enough, we have our greatest strength in the 15-to-24 age group as against Camel and Chesterfield, which are proportionately stronger among

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=146
1515

older age groups."

How old is John Barbose in 1953 again?

A.   He's 18 or 19.  He's just graduated high school.

Q.   Does he fit in that age group?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, you talked earlier -- I think I had mentioned it for you -- the normalization of cigarette smoking and the culture of cigarette smoking at the time .

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we have a slide here that shows some of that.

MR. CLARK:  That will be PDR 30 6. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   So where could you smoke when John Barbose was growing up, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Just about anywhere you wanted.  There were very few restrictions on smoking in the '50s and the '60s, frankly in the '70s.  So, you know, legislators would have -- you know, would smoke and you'd have hospitals.  You know, when I arrived at Roswell Park in 1981, where the -- they called them the pink ladies; they would bring the carts around to the patient's rooms.  And one of the things they were selling on the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=147
1516

pink -- on the carts was cigarettes to the patients.

So � and of course you have, you know, airplanes.  I think I mentioned the co-branding.  So cigarette smoking really didn't come off of airplanes until the early 1990s.  And there were really no restrictions, even the smoking and nonsmoking seats which came in in the late '80s.  So up until that time, you could get on an airplane and smoke a cigarette.  As I said, many of the cigarette companies co-marketed their brands with the airlines.  And we've mentioned the athletes before.

So it was, you know -- it's just common to see smoking everywhere.  You have to understand, again, when somebody was growing up in this era what, you know, smoking was like.

Q.   I want to go back to this -- I want to go back to the cigarette consumption chart for a second here, Dr. Cummings. A.   Sure.

MR. PHILIPSON:  It will take me a second.

MR. CLARK:  That's okay.  I'll go ahead and use the board.  That's fine.

Maybe if I can come a little bit closer to the witness there, Judge?

Q.   What I'd like to -- I'm going to prop this on her chair.  All right.  Can you see it?

A.   I can see it.

Q.   Okay.  So the yellow line is the rise of cigarette sales.

A.   Yes.

Q.   That's what you said, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   Okay.  So if I can get you to go back in time and tell us, we see a dip here in sales roughly close to 1930.  What is that dip as a result of?

A.   That's the Great Depression.

Q.   Okay.  And so cigarette sales dropped because of that?

A.   Right.

Q.   How long did the Great Deposition --MR. CLARK:  Oh, we have it up now? THE WITNESS:  Yeah. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Okay.  How long did the Great Depression last roughly?

A.   Well, it lasted more than the dip, but there was a little dip as a result because people didn't have money to spend on cigarettes.  And so there was a -- you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=149
1518

know, this rapid rise in cigarette sales.  But in the early 1930s, there was that little dip that occurred there, and then you can see it quickly rebounded.  And, you know, these are record -- every year there's a record in cigarette sales.  It goes up, right up to this point and --

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object.  I think the

question was, how long did the Great Depression

last?

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let me ask you this question, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Not to cut you off beforehand.  Going to 1930 up to about 1950, 1951, and '52, is there any sign of cigarette sales dropping off because of anything that the public is becoming aware of?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  All right.  So let's get to that big dip right after 1954 a minute.  Now, yesterday, one of the first documents -- I think the first document the jury saw was Dr. Teague's survey of cancer research.  Do you remember that document?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And remind the jury what the date of that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=150
1519

document was.

A.   February 1953.

Q.   Okay.  Now, if you would -- I don't mean to put this up.  But if you would be so kind as to remind the jury what Dr. league's conclusions were in that report.

A.   He concluded that the rapid rise in lung cancer that had occurred from the early part of the 20th century here, up until this time, which paralleled cigarette use, that the clinical data, the human epidemiologic studies that had been done at that point, showed -- were consistent with the view that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer and that the animal studies were � you know, while not completely, you know, determinate, they were generally consistent in showing -- and these animal studies was where you take the tobacco tar and you would paint it onto animals and they would fractionate different parts of the tar to remove nicotine or other things to see what it was that was causing the disease.  They were generally consistent with the evidence.  And that the emerging data on the chemistry were also consistent with the view that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer.  That was his conclusion in 1953.

Q.   And so that -- as a baseline, that was R.J. Reynolds' knowledge in 19- -- February of 1953

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=151
1520

about the association between cancer and cigarette smoking.  Is that what I heard you to say?

A.   Yeah.  They were tracking the evidence that was coming out I think I had mentioned earlier, as this rapid increase in lung cancer occurred about 10 to 15 years after the rise in cigarette sales.  You know, the medical doctors are noticing this and they're starting to write it up in their medical journals and summarizing some of that evidence in those areas that I've mentioned.

Q.   And so going back to my point about the --well, your point, actually, that every year is a record year for cigarette sales between 1930 and 1950, did the industry conduct research on public awareness in that timeframe on -- strike that.

Did the industry conduct research and polling information -- obtain polling information on public awareness regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking during that timeframe?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Who is Elmo Roper?

A.   Elmo Roper was the Roper Polling firm.  It's a big polling firm, sort of like Gallup.  Roper did a lot of work for Philip Morris.  A document that -- from George Weissman to Dr. Dupuis was referencing the Roper

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=152
1521

poll they had done in 1953 of 10,000 households where they had surveyed 15-year-olds and older to summarize the data on who was smoking, prevalence rates.  They also asked about what people believed about the health risks of smoking.

Q.   What has your research shown and what did that research show as to the public's awareness regarding the health effects of cigarette smoking during this time period?

A.   Well, the most common response is there was --they didn't believe there was any problem with cigarette smoking.  And less than 1 percent, I believe, or around 1 percent said cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer.  So, you know, from that, it wasn't on the radar screen of the American public in 1953 that cigarette smoking is a cause of cancer, at least based on that very large representative survey of 10,000 Americans.

Q.   All right.  Now, we'll get to this dip in the early part of the '50s, but you testified about it yesterday.  Was research on going outside of the industry looking at whether or not smoking caused lung cancer?

A.   Sure.  You can go back and look at the medical literature, some of which Dr. Teague summarized. Philip Morris was summarizing this literature internally

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=153
1522

as well.  You can look at their internal studies where they're abstracting the medical literature.  And a confluence of that really in the 1950s -- there were five articles that came out in 1949 to 1950 implicating cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer in leading medical journals around the world.

Q.   Was there one in particular that caught the attention of the popular press?

A.   Well, you know, all of these were, you know, being picked up.  And you could see some reports in the popular press of these epidemiologic studies.  But in 1953, an author by the name of Ernst Wynder and his colleagues, Dr. Evarts Graham and Dr. Croninger, published a paper in Cancer Research.  It was a mouse painting experiment.  Wynder had published one of those human studies in 1950.  1953, he does the mouse painting experiment, shows that the more tar you put on a mouse, the more tumors you get; the longer you're painting the mouse, the more tumors.  And this research got picked up in the popular press.

I think you're holding LIFE Magazine.  They did it in their December issue of LIFE Magazine.  And they featured his research.  And they show you the animals and some of the smoking machine they used to extract the tar and so on.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=154
1523

Q. And you said this was picked up in the popular press, LIFE Magazine. How popular was LIFE Magazine at the time?

A.   It was a very popular magazine, you know, pictorial magazine.  In fact, if you look at that, you can see some examples of cigarette ads.  I think there are three of them in that magazine.  The back cover, I think you can �

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, with the Court's

permission, I would like to pass the copy of the

LIFE Magazine that we have around to the jury so

they can see this.

Do you want to give it to them? BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And this was kind of a centerfold piece of this particular magazine, correct, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Right.  The article --

Q.   Well, let me ask you this.  I'm sorry. You were starting to say it, that this particular edition also has cigarette advertising in it, you said.

A.   Yeah, I think there are three ads.  You'll see

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=155
1524

the examples of -- just before Christmas, you'll see the examples of the gift cartons that are represented.  And they're colored ads, distinct from other ads in the magazine, many of which are in black and white.

Q.   With the press coverage that Dr. Wynder and Dr. Graham's study received in 1953, did that have any effect on the stock prices of cigarette companies?

A.   Sure.

Q.   What is that?

A.   Well, went down.  In 1953, cigarette sales went down.  And it's this confluence of evidence that's coming out.  Doctors are beginning to talk about this evidence because these scientists, medical doctors are going to their meetings and they're saying, whoa, you know, cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, here is the studies.  And they're presenting their results. Dr. Wynder's study, which was not the first mouse painting study.  In fact, there are 40 mouse painting or animal studies summarized in Dr. league's review.  So there are many of these.  But he -- the study got a lot of publicity.  And it showed that the clinical data, the human studies sometimes referred to as statistical studies, now we were getting evidence from the animal studies there is something in here that's causing cancer.  And that was concerning.  And cigarette sales

began to

	I mean --
	

A.
	-- not -- not a lot
	I mean, the information

on smoking and health really
		-- you can find articles

beforehand that were coverin
		g some of those, other

medical
	articles in places 1
	ike Reader's Digest and so

on.  But
	really it accelerat
	es and the research in the

medical
	community begins to
	focus in the '50s.  So �

and the
	'60s.  And of course
	the public gets exposed to

that.  S
	o in the '50s, the '
	60s, the '70s, the '80s � I

mean, by
	the time you're in
	the mid '80s, it's hard to

deny that cigarette smoking
		is a cause of health

problems if you're a smoker in the United States.

Q.   And what I meant to get to, Dr. Cummings, was simply this.  The jury was shown yesterday some Reader's Digest articles and things like that.

How did the information coming out in the popular press before 1953 compare to cigarette advertising at the time?

A.   Oh, it was -- the way I would give you the analogy, you've got an elephant on one part of the scale and a grain of sand on the other.  So, I mean, the amount of cigarette advertising is massive.  It's everywhere.  You can't escape it.  And that's why the culture of smoking as a rite of passage and you've got celebrities versus, you know, the odd article in some medical journal that might get picked up in a magazine article or whatever, or newspaper.  It was very limited and very different.  That's shifted over time, particularly after the '64 Surgeon General's report.  I think the information coming out to the public is beginning to grow, but it was still limited.  Even up until the early 1980s, most of the American public still was not persuaded that cigarette smoking was a serious cause of disease, particularly to themselves.

Q.   Now, we see here this was part of the LIFE Magazine article.  The American Tobacco Company had a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=158
1527

response to that.  And let me read this to you.

"The American Tobacco Company hastened to point out that tests on mice do not prove that tobacco can cause lung cancer in men."

Is that a position the industry took at that time?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So back to my question about the fall of the stock prices resulting from the falling cigarette sales, was that information picked up by the New York Times?

A.   Sure.

MR. CLARK:  We have a copy of that, please.

1044 A. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And that is dated December 10th, 1953. "Tobacco Stocks Hit by Cancer Reports." Is this the article that was picked up by the New York Times?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Or the article that was put out by the New York Times?

A.   Right.  Just like today, we hear, you know, stocks go up and they go down, and this was, you know, viewed by the industry because their sales had dropped in 1953 and evidence was coming out in these medical

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=159
1528

meetings implicating their product.  And the industry viewed this as a crisis and they responded to that crisis.

Q.   And so that's where I want to go next.

MR. CLARK:  But, Your Honor, this might be a good time for a break, if you're so inclined.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a 15-minute break. And if you need to use the ladies' room, I guess you're going to have to go downstairs.  I apologize for that on behalf of the County of Pasco.  Again, you're under the same instructions on the recess not to discuss this or do any other research.

So thank you for your attention this morning. We'll take 15 minutes, 10:30 by the courthouse clock.  Thank you.

THE BAILIFF:  Court will be in recess until 10:30.

(The jury excused from the courtroom at 10:15 a.m.)

(Recess taken from 10:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.)

THE COURT:  You want to leave the lights off that we have or turn them back on?  Any more videos?

MR. CLARK:  Yeah, we're going to have some videos here in the not too distant future.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=160
1529

THE COURT:  Leave them on.

MR. GEISE:  It's still plenty bright enough.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll start as soon as I find my bailiff.

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, something that I mentioned to Mr. Carter as well, and I don't know if I mentioned to Ms. Yates, so, obviously, I'll raise it now.

One of the reasons we were trying to get these objections to documents identified, things like that, so they can be taken care of, is if we wait until they come in the course of the examination and there is a sidebar for some of these, Mr. Clark isn't necessarily the one that we've identified to argue for that document.  We're trying to share the load as it may be.  I know Your Honor doesn't want multiple people at the bench for things like that, but there are some things where we obviously have to have to make sure our record is preserved, make sure we're making the right arguments and so on, so that's another reason we're trying to find out which ones we actually have to take up with the Court so that if it ends up it's not Mr. Clark's assignment, if you will, it's me.  Or if it's Mr. Vaka or Ms. Cherry, that we have the right person to argue

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=161
1530

and we're not having extra people coming to the bench.

THE COURT:  That's fine.  Obviously, we just don't want all 14 of you up here.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.  So we'll try to avoid that whenever we can, but �

THE COURT:  I understand.

MR. BIGGER:  If it just happens to come up, that's why someone else might come up there.

MR. CARTER:  No one ranger per riot roll?

THE COURT:  Yeah, that's right.

MR. BIGGER:  I mean, if Mr. Thorne needs to go up with Ms. Yates now, I don't have a problem with that.  We're obviously not taking -- no one is abusing the issue, no one is --

THE COURT:  That's fine.

The jurors have inquired whether we're getting off early today.

MR. BIGGER:  Always a good sign.

MR. GEISE:  I like the way they think.

THE COURT:  So, obviously, we need to plow through this, so let's try to shoot for 4:30, is all I'm saying, give them a little bit of a break.

MR. BIGGER:  I don't think there is any circumstance where 4:30 is going to present a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=162
1531

problem, no matter what.  The only question will be, you know, we'll either be finished with the direct or almost finished with the direct.  We just don't know exactly where that's going to come down.

THE COURT:  That's fine.

MR. BIGGER:  Depends on lunch, arguments take a little longer, or document issues.  Regardless, we're perfectly comfortable stopping at 4:30 if that's the Court's pleasure, and it sounds like the jury's pleasure as well.

MR. CLARK:  If I get to a good stopping point at 4:15 or 4:20, you're okay with that?

THE COURT:  That's absolutely fine.  I don't want to interrupt you in a bad spot, but let's shoot for that.  The whistle is not going to go off or anything.

MR. BIGGER:  It's not a trap door?

THE COURT:  Trap door.  I'm still looking for that button, yeah.

I wonder where Marc is.  See if I can find him. I know the judicial assistants had free donuts, so there's a good chance that's where he is.

MR. BIGGER:  Where is that again, Judge?

THE COURT:  Pastries is how they put it.

Ready to go?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=163
1532

(The jury entered the courtroom at 10:34 a.m.) THE BAILIFF:  All jurors present, Judge. THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are � you may be seated.

We are going to continue with the direct examination.  We will be taking a lunch as close to noon as possible, and we will continue with this witness after lunch.  We're going to try to get out about 4:30 today to give you all a little bit of a break, okay?  I know it's been a long week.  We recognize that.

Counsel, you may proceed. MR. CLARK:  Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the Court. THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   All right, Dr. Cummings.  Right before we took our break, we were talking about the Wynder Graham study and the fall of cigarette prices and the dip in cigarette sales in 1953.  We saw a preview to it in the LIFE magazine article that the American Tobacco Company had a response.

So what I want to go to now is what was that response?  So my question to you, Dr. Cummings, is, in response to the falling cigarette prices, what did the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=164
1533

cigarette manufacturers do?

A.   Well, the response was -- Paul Hahn, who was the president of American Tobacco, contacted his counterparts in other cigarette companies -- so R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, a company called Benson & Hedges that existed back then, Lorillard, Brown & Williamson, Liggett Myers -- were all invited to come to meet at the Plaza Hotel in New York City to discuss a response to the growing evidence that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.  And so they met at the Plaza Hotel, all but Liggett & Myers.

Actually, Liggett & Myers commented they thought the situation would merely blow over, and so they chose not to attend.

Q.   And you're starting to mention some names, so I want to make sure we kind of put some faces to them. You said a Paul Hahn.

MR. CLARK:  Can you blow up Paul Hahn for me

there, Baron?  Far right, second row. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And he is who?

A.   He was the president of American Tobacco at the time.  You know, he's later -- we saw Mr. Heimann became president of American Tobacco, but Paul Hahn was the president at the time in 1953.  And American Tobacco was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=165
1534

the leading seller of cigarettes.  They had two pretty popular brands.  Lucky Strike was a very popular brand, and then Pall Mall at that time was a popular brand.

Invited Ed Darr, who was from R.J. Reynolds. He was the president of R.J. Reynolds.  And he attended the meeting.  Joe Cullman from Benson & Hedges.  He was the president of that company.  Parker McComas, who was president of Philip Morris Tobacco Company, attended.

Q.   Let me interrupt you just for a second here.

That's Joseph Cullman III.  Who is Joe Cullman II?  That's his father?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So how did this meeting initially get set up? Who initiated this meeting?

A.   Paul Hahn is the one who sent out the original telegram.  The telegram went out December 10th inviting the companies to come to a meeting to discuss how they might respond together.

MR. CLARK:  And this is PT � for the record,

PT1044. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Not an e-mail in those days?

A.   Not an e-mail.

Q.   So this is Paul Hahn, president of American Tobacco, and he sent this to the presidents of the other

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=166
1535

manufacturers, including R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.

And he says here on the December 10th, 1953, "In view of the highly-publicized claims of certain medical men not sponsored by any duly-accredited scientific medical organization charging serious danger to health from smoking, I suggest for your consideration a meeting of the heads of all those cigarette companies that have manifested active interest in scientific research and are, therefore, informed as to the true facts.  The objective would be an industry response to these charges exposing their lack of scientific foundation."

What were the true facts known to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1953?

A.   As we saw from February of 1953, so earlier in the year, Claude Teague had reported to senior management his conclusions based on the evidence that the rapid rise in lung cancer was likely caused by cigarette smoking -- particularly heavy cigarette smoking.  That's what the clinical data showed.  And the other data on animals was generally consistent with that finding.

Q.   Did the industry agree with Paul Hahn and have a meeting?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=167
1536

A.   Most of them did.  As I mentioned, Liggett Myers chose not to attend, but the other companies did attend the meeting.  The meeting was held on December 14th.  We have minutes of the meeting, so on December 14th, and then again on the 15th, and then through December.  You could see that this was really viewed as a crisis for them.  So there are minutes of meetings on December 24th, the day before Christmas; December 26th, the day after Christmas.  And then December 28th is when they sort of tie up how all this will be paid for, their response will be presented.  And then they actually announced the formation of the TIRC and the Frank Statement --

Q.   Before we get there --

A.   � in January.

Q.   -- Philip Morris attended?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And R.J. Reynolds attended?

A.   Yes.

Q. And what was the first order of business --when they met at the Plaza Hotel, what was the first order of business for these executives?

A.   The first order of business was basically to talk about hiring a public relations firm to develop a response -- a unified response on behalf of the industry

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=168
1537

to the smoking and health issue.  And they agreed in that meeting on December 14th to hire the company Hill & Knowlton.

Q.   And Hill & Knowlton is what?

A.   They're a public relations firm.  They were a very well-known public relations firm of the day.  They were located in the Empire State plaza building.

So when the TIRC is formed, it's located one floor below the public relations firm of Hill & Knowlton.

Q.   Prior to Hill & Knowlton -- well, strike that. Did the industry implement a public relations campaign regarding the health effects of smoking?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And was that campaign orchestrated through Hill & Knowlton by the cigarette companies?

A.   It was.

Q.   And so what did Hill & Knowlton do to prepare itself in order to meet that challenge?

A.   Well, they met with the executives on December 15th.  So the executives met themselves, were going to hire a public relations firm.  We agreed Hill & Knowlton.  That's on the 14th.

On the 15th, John Hill and some of his colleagues come in and meet with the companies to talk

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=169
1538

about issues.  John Hill said, You must have a research program to show an accurate response -- a decent response to this growing evidence on smoking and health.

And so that's how that program really came about, as a result of Hill & Knowlton's suggestion, John Hill's suggestion.

They interviewed members, research directors from the different companies.  And that's described in the December 15th minutes.  They created a white paper that was written by Tommy Ross.

White paper is sort of a summary of the industry's views on smoking and health; were a collection of other people's views that were consistent with the industry's position.  And that was written by Tommy Ross.  He was an attorney for American Tobacco. It later was widely distributed by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  It's called the "Cigarette Controversy."  It was the first of the white papers sent out by them.

Q.   Before we get there, can you please tell the jury who Ed Dakin was?  Dakin, Dakin?

A.   Dakin.

Q.   Who was he?

A.   He was an employee of Hill & Knowlton, and he prepared sort of a dossier of the interviews that had

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=170
1539

been done of the research directors of four of the companies, because they had gone out and interviewed them to basically get their views on smoking and health and was trying to educate the public relations staff at Hill & Knowlton about what the challenge was, you know, for their new client, the cigarette industry.

So he created a memo called the "Forwarding Memo."  And I think we brought along the Forwarding Memo.

Q.   PT2061.  This is the Forwarding Memorandum?

A.   Right.

Q.   I believe the jury may have heard about this document in opening, but let' s take a look at what Mr. Dakin says here.  This is on page 2 of the Forwarding Memorandum.

"The attitude of the men, we must directly deal with" -- now this is Hill & Knowlton talking about the cigarette executives?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "The attitude of the men we must directly deal with in the industry is at once interesting and important for us to understand.  That is why notes on the four interviews with research directors are given at some length.  You'll get from them little real information about lung cancer, pro or con, but you'll

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=171
1540

find some mighty interesting opinions.  One of the men said, ' It' s fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't break.'  Said another, 'Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was first to produce a cancer-free cigarette.  What we could do to competition.'  Said another, 'Suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette less a day.  That would be maybe 40 billion a year.'  And, again, the stock market fall is terrible, when you remember dividends are going to be much higher next year without the EPT."

What is the EPT? A.   Excess profit tax.

MR. CLARK:  Please go down, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "This is the way the world ends, not in a bang, but a whimper.  But, naturally, that is something almost too terrible for most of the industry's men to realize. Even yet, though the very heads of the great corporations themselves signalized the end of the old days when they linked arms and walked together to consult with us."

Let me talk about that just for a second.

You mentioned it yesterday, briefly, about splitting up a company over some antitrust issues earlier.  And prior to this, how common was it for the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=172
1541

industry leaders to get together?

A.   Very uncommon.  I mean, they're supposed to be competitors.  So to get together was very uncommon.  I think they mentioned that they occasionally saw each other at various trade association-type meetings and so on, but it was not the norm and that would not be the norm for any kind of competitive industry, be it the car industry or the food industry or the tobacco industry.

Q.   Was this unprecedented?

A.   It was a concern to them, so it was unprecedented because they were responding to the fact that their sales had declined and they wanted to reverse that trend.

Q.   "So what do they need to do?  There is only one problem, confidence and how to establish it, public assurance and how to create it, in a perhaps long interim when scientific doubts must remain.  And, most important, how to free millions of Americans from the guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their biological depths regardless of any poo-pooing logic every time they light a cigarette."

Did the campaign that they orchestrated beginning here with the Plaza Hotel, did it have that effect on American consumers of cigarettes?

A.   Yes, they provided, essentially, an alternative

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=173
1542

perspective on whether smoking caused disease.  So they essentially talk about reassuring consumers that it's okay to continue to smoke.  And as you go on, they talk about the cigarette controversy, that it's unproven, that went on for the next 45 years.

Q.   Going back to the chart, how long does it take before those millions of Americans have been released from that guilty fear and cigarette sales start to become record-setting years, again?

A.   Well, basically, the sales dropped in '53 and early part of '54, and they revamped rapidly after that and cigarette sales continued to go up, you know, really till the mid 1960s.  Then you have another health issue that comes out, which is the Surgeon General's report, and there's a little dip that occurs in January.  The report came out in January -- January and February, and then it rebounds again.

You can see how the industry respond.  They introduced filtered cigarettes and a campaign to say it was okay to continue to smoke; you can get the good taste of a cigarette in a filter version.

Q.   Okay.  So you said the last meeting took place -- this series of meetings in the Plaza Hotel, they took place -- the last one was December 28, 1953. What did the industry decide to do at the conclusion of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=174
1543

these meetings?

A.   Well, they talked about the formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, this organization which they claimed would be focused on studying the alleged relationship between smoking and health and then providing facts.  That's what they said in their articles of incorporation that were sent to the Department of Justice.

But what they did in the December 28th is they announced this through the Frank Statement.  And there were various drafts of the Frank Statement that were developed in December.  And they finalized the draft on December 28th, and they talk about how they're going to pay for the ad.  They decide it would be a paid ad. They wanted it to be prominent, like a full-page ad in most newspapers.  And where they wanted it to appear is newspapers that had circulation of 25,000 or more people, so large cities, in over 400 newspapers.  And that ad appeared in early January of 1954.

Q.   Before we get to that, have you seen a draft of the Frank Statement that was edited on December 26, 1953?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.

MR. CLARK:  This is PT2295.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=175
1544

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And is this that document?

A.   Yes.  This is out of the files of Hill & Knowlton.  And that's the draft.  You can see this one is, I think, December -- can't read the date there, but was it 24th or 26th?

Q.   26th.

A.   Yeah.  So the day after Christmas, they're editing the draft based on corrections from the -- you can see December 28th.  That's the meeting of the executives when they got back together to figure out how they're going to pay for this and the final approval of the final copy for the Frank Statement.

Q.   So do we see from this draft some items that the industry leaders decided they wanted to remove from the Frank Statement that was ultimately going to get published?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look at that, too.  You already have that.

So they one-lined out that first sentence.  But it says, "We will never produce and market a product shown to be the cause of any serious human ailment."

Had they already been doing that, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Doing what?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=176
1545

Q.   Producing and marketing a product that they knew was the cause of serious human ailment?

A.   Yes.  They knew their products -- based on the evidence internally of what they were tracking from the medical literature, they believed their products did cause cancer.

Q.   Let's look on page 3 of that.

So they took out "The committee will undertake to keep the public informed of such facts as may be developed relating to cigarette smoking and health and other pertinent matters."

Did the tobacco industry keep the public informed of true facts?

A.   No.  They -- as I think we will see, they manufactured a controversy.  And as the evidence became incontrovertible over time, they continued that controversy right up through 19- -- really, 2000 for the individual companies.

But the Tobacco Institute, never in its history, said that smoking caused harm, nor did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  They went out of business in 1998, so you get this, what I call, you know, the coverup, 45 years of effort, the period in which John Barbose, you know, was -- grew up and became a smoker.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=177
1546

Q.   And that coverup, that linking of the arms that the industry did back in 1953, that carried all the way through the rest of John Barbose's life?  Is that what I heard you say?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's look at the Frank Statement that was published.  This is PT307.

And this appeared -- this appeared on what date?

A.   January 3rd.

Q.   And it reached how many subscribers?

A.   You know, about 40 -- a little over 40 million Americans were exposed to the Frank Statement based on, you know, newspaper circulation and where they placed the ad.

Q.   It obviously didn't reach everybody.  But how can you characterize the widespread nature of the publication?

A.   Well, I have all the internal documents from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, later known as CTR, as well as the Tobacco Institute.  So what they put in the Frank Statement is just the beginning of the campaign that goes on for the next 45 years.

So, you know, this is the message that is repeated over and over again through their spokespeople

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=178
1547

who appear on national media, who went through various press releases, major newspapers and magazine articles, over and over and over again in a massive campaign, over a billion dollars spent between 1954 and 1998 to basically execute this false controversy.

Q.   So -- can you see it okay, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Can you read that top paragraph, please?

A.   Sure.  It says, "Recent reports on experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings."

They're obviously referencing Dr. Wynder's mouse painting experiments that came out at the same time in LIFE magazine, as you saw.

Q.   So in this publication, do they make some promises to the American public?

A.   They do.  They make three affirmative promises to the American public.  They say that we're going to put the public's health above all other considerations of our business --

Q.   Stop right there.

A.   Sure.

Q.   The course of your research and looking at the industry company documents, did the cigarette industry,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=179
1548

including R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, put the public's health on top of every other consideration in their business?

A.   No.

Q.   And if they didn't put that at the top of their consideration, do you know what they put at the top of their consideration?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What was that?

A.   Their profits.

Q.   All right.  "We believe the products we make are not injurious to health."

Will we hear that same theme being repeated for the rest of the 20th century?

A.   We do.  That theme is made consistently, really, up until after the Surgeon General's report comes out, and then it sort of is revised slightly to say we just don't know whether cigarette smoking causes disease, more research is needed.

Q.   "We always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health."

Did that turn out to be a true statement?

A.   It turned out not to be a true statement.

Q.   And just by a preview, what did they do that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=180
1549

violated that promise?

A.   Well, I mean, they attacked the Surgeon General's reports and went after those scientists to discredit them who were talking about the fact that cigarettes caused harm to human health, typically lung cancer.  And so they belittled their findings to try to keep, you know, a controversy.  Had there been no controversy, probably wouldn't be here.

Q. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee, what was its paramount purpose that the industry proclaimed it was for?

A.   Well, the tobacco industry, the TIRC, they basically said it was to fund independent research into the allegations that cigarette smoking caused disease, particularly lung cancer, and that they would provide factual information to the public on that topic.  That was the statement they made in what they called the "limits of powers" sent to the Department of Justice in January of 1954.

Q.   We'll get to that in just a minute.

A.   Sure.

Q.   So where was the Tobacco Industry Research Committee located?

A.   The Empire State Building, one floor --

Q.   In relation to Hill & Knowlton, where?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=181
1550

A.   They were one floor below.

Q.   They were not in a cigarette lab or research facility?

A.   No.

Q.   Who signed off on this?  We have the American Tobacco Company, we have Paul Hahn?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Joseph Cullman, Jr., president of Benson & Hedges?

A.   Right.  Benson & Hedges is bought by Philip Morris in the next year, and Joseph Cullman becomes the president of Philip Morris.

Q.   Timothy V. Hartnett, president of Brown & Williamson -- will we hear from Timothy Hartnett later on?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what does he end up becoming?

A.   He became the chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Q.   Herbert Kent, from Lorillard; Parker McComas, president of Philip Morris; and Ed Darr, president of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, those all signed off on the Frank Statement?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You were starting to get there.  You said that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=182
1551

they sent a document to the justice department regarding the limits of powers.  So let's take a look at that for just a minute.

MR. CLARK:  This is PT6410. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   All right.  So who was Stanley Barnes?

A.   Well, Judge Barnes was the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, so he worked in the justice department.

Q.   And has your research shown what concerns the industry may have had while they submitted this to Stanley Barnes?

A.   Obviously, they had some concerns early on meeting together as a group and so on, so they did communicate with Judge Barnes and they acknowledged that they had hired a public relations firm.  And then they articulated the limits of the powers, what the TIRC, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which they had created and already announced at that point, what those articles of incorporation were.  And this is the cover letter, along with the example of the -- of the --

Q.   Again, this is from the American Tobacco Company dated January 26th, 1954, roughly three weeks after the Frank Statement is published?

A.   That's right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=183
1552

Q.   It says, "Dear Judge Barnes, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 21st in which you request me as chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee to furnish you details of the plans of our committee."

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to page 8 with that,

Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And these are the limits of powers that you were just talking about.  Can you read that for us, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yes.  It says, "The purpose and objectives of the committee are to aid and assist research into tobacco use and health, and particularly into the alleged relationship between the use of tobacco and lung cancer, and to make available to the public factual information on this subject.  It is the considered judgment of the committee that the activities shall be confined to the purposes set forth above."

Q.   Keep going, please.

A.   "And that it is in no wise to be considered or to operate as a trade association or to participate in any activity or give consideration to any matters affecting the business conduct or activities of its members, and that its activities in every respect shall

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=184
1553

conform to law and all decree or judgments of courts affecting or relating to the tobacco industry."

Q.   That's signed by who?

A.   I believe this letter is -- I think all of the companies may have signed the articles of incorporation, but Paul Hahn is the one who was the original chairman, since he's the one that called the meeting.  I think he was the original chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the first few months, and then Parker McComas from Philip Morris became the chair.  And then Tim Hartnett resigned from Brown & Williamson and became the permanent chairman of the TIRC.

Q.   Okay.  So after the Frank Statement is published after the TIRC is up and running, do executives and industry leaders go out and essentially spread the same message that was originally disclosed in the Frank Statement?

A.   Yeah.  There is a public relations effort that kicks off with the Frank Statement in early January. And then George Weissman and other executives for the company go on the road and talk to distributors, vending machine operators at their annual meetings to basically explain the industry's position on smoking and health and what they will do if their products were ever found to be harmful to human health.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=185
1554

Q.   And we've already heard from Mr. Weissman. You've already talked about Mr. Weissman.  We've seen some of his stuff already.

Is he one of those individuals that goes out and speaks at various trade organizations?

A.   Yes, he does a speech to, I think, the vending machine group in February.  Either February or March. There's two groups that he spoke to.  I have his --there are copies of his speech that he gives, you know, essentially reiterating the Frank Statement.  And then what he basically says is, you know, If we were ever to find that our products are harmful to human health, we would stop business.

Q.   Let's look at it.

MR. CLARK:  This is PT3785. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Facts vs. Fancy.  An address before the seven states, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, regional NAMA meeting in St. Simons, Georgia, on February 26, 1954, by George Weissman, vice president of Philip Morris & Company Limited, Incorporated."

Then this is what he says.  Would you read that, please, Dr. Cummings?

A.   "Gentlemen, that is the position we subscribe

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=186
1555

to.  Believe me, I know this is your position as well as ours.  If any one of us believed that the product we are making and selling was in any way harmful to our customer's health, and our own as well, we would voluntarily go out of business."

Q.   I know it goes without saying, but it's not rhetorical, did Philip Morris ever go out of business?

A.   No, Philip Morris never went out of business, but Philip Morris also reiterated this statement in 1972 and 1997.

Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds ever go out of business?

A.   No.

Q.   Do we also have some video of some of those statements, as well, being made?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I believe I alluded to this one with Timothy Hartnett.  This is PT1682A.  This is going to be Timothy Hartnett.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"Hartnett, former president of a major tobacco

firm and chairman of the Industry Research

Committee.

Mr. Murrow, I would like to quote from a

statement released at the time the Tobacco Industry

stated we accept an interest in people's health as a

basic responsibility paramount to every other

consideration in our business, and that's where we

stand today."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   The same statement made in the Frank Statement, this is now being made by Timothy Hartnett who signed off on the Frank Statement?

A.   Yeah, about a year later.  This is in the spring of 1955.  And there was a series of --

Q.   I was going to ask you about that.  I know where you're going.

What program was this shown on?

A.   "See It Now."

Q.   He mentioned Mr. Murrow.  Who was Murrow?

A. Edward R. Murrow, famous war correspondent. He was the celebrity who was on the "See It Now" show, sort of like the 60 Minutes show of the day.

Q.   Now, that same episode, he was not the only industry leader that appeared on that show, was he?

A.   No, there were other -- there were a variety of people who appeared.  They did a two-part series on smoking and health.  And they had Ed -- well, I think it

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

was Dr. Dupuis appeared from Philip Morris.  He was actually representative of the Tobacco Industry Technical Research Committee, which were made up of the research directors of the companies.  And they provided advice to the TIRC.  And he appeared.  And then there were -- Dr. Wynder appeared, Cuyler Hammond from the Cancer Society appeared on the show.  There were a variety of people that were interviewed, both pro and con, as to whether smoking caused disease.

Q.   And Dr. Dupuis was affiliated or worked for which company?

A.   Philip Morris.  He was the research director. MR. CLARK:  This is PT1682B.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"As Dr. Little said earlier, all of the

research of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

is done independent of the cigarette companies.

Nonetheless, each major cigarette producer has been

conducting its own experiments on this problem.

This is the Richmond laboratory of one of the major

producers.

I am Dr. Robert M. Dupuis, Chairman of the

Industry Technical Group of the Tobacco Industry

Research Committee.  Our primary objective is to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=189
1558

analyze all of the components of smoke.  Of course, we do a great deal of research on analysis and technology of tobacco itself.  But even if we knew all of the components of tobacco, we still would not know the components of smoke.  And since smoke is what we sell, we feel we should emphasize this phase of research.

After we have produced the smoke and separated it into fractions, the next step is to identify these fractions.  These are then identified either photographically or on the oscilloscope.  The oscilloscope is now demonstrating the means of identification of one of the smoke components. Using these instruments, we have isolated and identified some three dozen components of smoke. Many more will be identified.

As we find these components, we publish the results of our work in technical journals which are available to any scientist in any part of the world. So far we've found none that gives any cause for concern.  If we do find any that we consider harmful, and so far we have not, we'll remove these from smoke and still retain the pleasure of your favorite cigarette."

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Now, how common was it -- we saw some advertising.  How common was it for industry spokespeople to be smoking on television as well?

A.   It was very common.

Q.   What about the actual correspondence or the anchor people?

A.   It was very common.  Again, people -- they were smoking, very common.  You would see people smoking.  In fact, when you look at the original Surgeon General's committee, the advisory committee, some pictures of them -- I think there were ten members.  Their ashtrays were all over the table.  I think five of them were smokers.

Q.   What year is that?

A.   That was in -- well, the committee met from '62 to '64 when they finally issued their report.

Q.   So, still, we're still a few years before that time of the "See It Now" show?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And tell us, during this period of time, where is John Barbose at in his life?  How old is he and where is he at?

A.   In the 1950s?

Q.   Yes, sir, the mid 1950s.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=191

A.   He's 20, 21 years old.  He's basically 21 years old when the "See It Now" show appears.

Q.   And is he still a cigarette smoker?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's move ahead a couple years.  And did the industry, after the TIRC and its public relations campaign had been ongoing for a few years, did they take a look and evaluate how effective that program had been?

A.   Yeah.  There are a number of internal documents at various times that talk about the success that they had in turning around the smoking and health issue and reassuring the public, and that they accredit that success with the public relations effort that was really initiated with the announcement of the TIRC.

Q.   Was there one in particular from 1957 from Ed Darr and Paul Hahn?

A.   Yeah.  Ed Darr from R.J. Reynolds writes to Paul Hahn and compliments him on creating -- bringing the executives together, said we'd be in a deplorable position had we not done that, and that the TIRC had been a successful defensive operation for the industry. He goes on, basically, to say, Moving forward, we probably need to have a separate organization that speaks on behalf of the industry.  And that's -- about a few months later is when the Tobacco Institute is spun

off from the communications committee.

MR. CLARK:  PT1608. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Again, this is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, July 30th, 1957, Ed Darr to Paul Hahn.

It says "Dear Mr. Hahn, you took a bold and courageous action in December 1953 when you called for a meeting of manufacturers and other industry groups to discuss ways and means of presenting a unified front against the claims that were being made that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  The formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was the result."

Did they tell Stanley Barnes in the limits of powers that the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was a unified front? A.   No.

Q.   "There is absolutely no question in my mind that if this committee had not been formed, the cigarette industry by now would have been in a deplorable position.  Instead, a very fine job has been done in counteracting unverified, unjustified, and unsubstantiated claims of the anticigarette fanatics. In other words, the TIRC has been a successful defensive operation."

Did they tell Stanley Barnes they were

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=193
1562

implementing a defensive operation?

A.   No.

Q.   Is that, in fact, what the TIRC was?

A.   Well, there are words that describe it that way.  They also describe it as a public relations gesture, a shield, a front in various documents you see internally.  And the evidence is that most of their research that they funded had little to do with smoking and health except for the special projects I described yesterday, which were the lawyer-selected projects to really counter the evidence and keep the controversy alive.

Q.   Let's talk a little bit about research for a minute, if we can.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Let's go to R.J. Reynolds for a minute.  Was the industry -- specifically, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, but we're going to talk about Reynolds for a minute.

Was the industry internally to its own labs also at that time doing research on their products?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And let's, if you can, please tell the -- let's just show it.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who is Alan Rodgman?

A.   He was an analytic chemist.  He was hired by R.J. Reynolds in 1954.  He -- Dr. Rodgman worked for Dr. Teague.  So Dr. Teague sort of ran the chemistry unit at this point, and Dr. Rodgman worked for him. Dr. Rodgman was doing experiments on isolating chemicals in cigarette smoke, particularly the class of chemicals called polycyclic hydrocarbons.  And he describes in this particular fairly-detailed analysis, which is citing published data in the medical literature, as well as their own internal scientific studies, the isolation and presence of these carcinogenic agents in their cigarettes.

Q.   And "carcinogenic agents" means what?

A.   Cancer-causing.

Q.   All right.  So this is September 28th, 1956, "Analysis of Cigarette Smoke Condensate."

What is cigarette smoke condensate?

A.   That's the tar.  So when you smoke a cigarette and you collect the tar and you -- it basically becomes a particulate matter, you can then isolate the chemicals in that particular condensate that you get.

Q.   "The isolation and/or identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Camel cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=195
1564

smoke condensate.  The object, to describe the experimental investigation on the isolation and/or identification of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in the cigarette smoke condensate from Camel blend tobacco."

Did R.J. Reynolds, at this point in time, acknowledge that there are carcinogens in the Camel cigarette smoke?

A.   No.

Q.   Do they do it internally?

A.   Yes.  I mean, here, they're testing their own products.  They've isolated many -- obviously, as I mentioned, they're -- they're citing some scientific literature, but this is an internal business record where you're testing your products, the product that you're selling to consumers, and they're noting here, you know, in view of the data that they, you know, collected here, it's logical to assume that the carcinogenic activity of cigarette smoke condensate is due to the presence of one or more, you know -- or many -- I can't read -- the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Q.   So there -- how many carcinogens are currently today identified in cigarette smoke?

A.   Over 60.  9,000 chemicals in every puff.  Sixty

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=196
1565

known carcinogens.

So this, you know � again, you have to recognize the field is developing in the '50s to isolate these chemicals, and they were isolating them.  And they �

Q.   As time goes on, do they find more and more and more carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

A.   Yes, not only the polycyclics, but a whole variety of other classes of chemicals; the metals --Q.   Like what?

A.   -- the phenols, and so on. Q.   Any -- any in particular? A.   Well, tobacco-specific nitrosamines are identified.

Q.   Are they carcinogenic -- carcinogenic? A.   Highly potent carcinogens in animal models, particularly for adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Q.   Show the jury something they saw yesterday. MR. CLARK:  This is PT578.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"They sure work hard, don't they, Barney? Yeah, I hate to see them work so hard. Yeah, me too.  Let's go around back where we can't see them.

Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.

Okay.  How's about taking a nap?

Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.

That's it.

Winston is the one filtered cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got the that filter blend.

Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes a big taste difference and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, they added a new white filter. Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially processed but good favor and filter smoke.

Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

"The Flintstones" has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette.  Winston tastes good like a cigarette should."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q. We're going to talk about filters a little bit later more in detail, but what I want to -- what I want to ask you here is, you have this advertisement for the Winston good flavor filter smoking, the -- the filter

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=198
1567

blend up front.

What was the relative market share of filtered cigarettes in the late '50s compared to what it had been before the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was founded in 1953?

A.   Well, the committee was founded the -- in the early '50s.  So if you go to the early '50s, it's the filter market was less than 2 percent.

Filtered cigarettes began to be introduced in the early '50s.  '52, I think you had Viceroy and Kent. Then you had Marlboro and Winston cigarettes.

Winston became the top-selling cigarette in the United States in the '60s.  And they introduced their filter blend cigarette.  As you saw, it's what's up front.  And the filter blend was different than the blend that was found in their Camel cigarettes. Q.   How so?

A.   Well, they started to add in more burley tobacco.  And I think I had mentioned yesterday, burley has a little bit more higher content of nicotine in it. And it also generates more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

So the blend of Winston cigarettes and other filter blends, since Marlboro did the same, all the filtered products, they used the cheaper -- it turned

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=199
1568

out to be cheaper at that time to buy burley tobacco. And with a filter on it, you could put a stronger blend in, and turned out to be much more carcinogenic than the blend of the unfiltered cigarettes like Lucky Strike and Camel, based on the internal business records of the tobacco companies.  I think Reynolds has the study they did in 1956.

Q.   Hold -- hold that thought for a second.  Let's take a look at that.

MR. CLARK:  PT4 9 93. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   You said Winston turned out to be more carcinogenic than Camel?

A.   About two-and-a-half times more carcinogenic in terms of identifying these polycyclics.  And it turns out the ones that they were isolating from the Winston tobacco were particularly potent in animal -- the mouse model experiment where you paint the tar on the model --you know, on the -- on the back of the animals, which is the way they would, you know, judge how carcinogenic a substance was.

Q.   This is November 23rd, 1956.

A.   Right.

Q.   Was this before "The Flintstones" --

Q.   -- commercial we saw?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   When was "The Flintstones"?

A.   1960, '61.

Q.   So this is four or five years before.  And who is Murray Senkus?

A.   Well, he was a research scientist at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  Rose up the ranks, became vice president of research for R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   And who is Kenneth Hoover?

A.   He was the director of research.  So this is from, you know, one of the top scientists to the head of R&D of R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   Okay.  Let's go to page 7 then.  So this is --this is the research he's doing on the Winston cigarette?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Let's take a look at what they say here.

"It was found that the fat and wax content of the Winston blends do not differ appreciably from that of the Camel blends.  Although the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content of the smoke from Winston cigarettes was two-and-a-half times that of the smoke from a Camel -- from Camel cigarettes."

Did R.J. Reynolds ever tell anyone in the

government or the public that Winston filtered cigarettes had two-and-a-half times the carcinogens of Camels?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.

Argumentative.

THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  No, they didn't. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   When did you learn about this information, Dr. Cummings?

A.   When I found this document.

Q.   Is there any way John Barbose could have known this?

A.   No.  This information was concealed from the American public.  It was concealed from the public health community.

As I said, I found this document probably after 2000, as I started researching the different types of products and what they knew about the harm of their products.

Q.   In the late 1950s, was there any doubt inside the industry that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

A.   No.  There is no doubt that the industry and the research directors of the companies have concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer.

series to the flue-cured series to the Winston series would markedly influence such properties as combustion, temperature, rate of burning, et cetera.  This, in turn, would be reflected in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content of the smoke."

Regardless of all that, Winston cigarettes with the filter blend had two-and-a-half times the carcinogens of the Camel cigarette?

A.   Yes.  They had two-and-a-half times more of the polycyclics.  The polycyclics that they identified were particularly potent carcinogens.

Q.   All right.  We were going to the 1958 document that you referred to.

What happened in 19- -- spring of 1958 that we're about to see here, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, there were scientists from overseas, other tobacco companies overseas, particularly British American Tobacco, and they're affiliated.  I think they had a scientist from one of their South African affiliated companies and the Canadian Imperial Tobacco that were owned by British American Tobacco.

Brown & Williamson at that time was an affiliate of British American Tobacco.  In other words, they were owned by BAT.

And so these three scientists come over,

1573

Dr. Felton and Reid and -- and Henley (sic), to basically interview, find out from the research directors of the major companies.  They met with people from the TIRC, the scientific advisory board of the TI- -- TIRC, academic researchers in the field, people at the National Cancer Institute.

Basically, their goal is to find out what is the view in 1958 as to whether cigarette smoking is a cause of cancer, lung cancer, and -- and then they go on to basically draw the conclusion, based on interviews I think they did with over 40 individuals at, you know, over a � two dozen institutions �

Q.   This is PT32- �

A.   -- including the major cigarette companies.

Q.   Sorry.  I didn't mean to talk over you, Dr. Cummings.

MR. CLARK:  PT3289, for the record. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   So this was the report that these scientists from the British American Tobacco Company made regarding their visit with industry scientists and executives, including R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

A.   Right.  They met with Alan Rodgman, actually, from Reynolds on May 5th, I believe.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=205
1574

Q.   Let's take a look at the itinerary.  So first -- first on the order of business is American Tobacco.

A.   Right.

Q.   And who are they meeting with there?

A.   Those are their principal research scientists, so the heads of their R&D department.

Q.   Okay.  And then they go down on the 24th of April to Richmond, Virginia and they meet with Philip Morris.  And who -- who -- who are they meeting with there?

A.   Well, Dr. Seligman who is in R&D and -- and Mr. O'Keefe.

Q.   Okay.  28th, they're in New York City meeting with who for the TIRC and what advertising company?

A.   Well, William Hoyt was the PR person hired by TIRC.  Previously worked for Hill & Knowlton.  He went over to the TIRC, and Carl Thompson was one of the principal at -- you know, executives at Hill & Knowlton. So he met with the public relations people, basically.

Q.   I noticed there, we didn't -- maybe you didn't see it, but they did go to your old institution, Roswell Park?

A.   Yeah.  Fred -- Fred Bock at -- at Roswell Park, who I replaced actually, he retired when I came to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=206
1575

Roswell Park.  I assumed his position essentially doing tobacco work.  And he -- he was one of the early scientists to really show the link between cigarette smoking and disease.

Q.   And -- and at Yale University on the 29th, you have Dr. H.S.N. Greene.  Who was he?  What was he?

A.   He was a -- yeah.  He was a pathologist at Yale.

Q.   All right.  Let's keep going down the itinerary a little bit.  They go back to the TIRC again.

A.   Right.  May 5th, this is where they met with Dr. Rodgman from R.J. Reynolds.

The industry technical committee of TIRC.  So these were the research directors of all of the major cigarette companies who were members of TIRC.  And they, you know, met as well.

Q.   Was that the same committee that Dr. Dupuis was on when he was on "See It Now"?

A.   Yeah, he was the chairman of that committee.

Q.   At that time?

A.   At that time.

Q.   Now, it's Mr. -- looks like Hammer?

A.   Hammer from American.

Q.   All right.  So on the 8th, they go back to the TIRC again.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=207
1576

A.   Right.

Q.   And then they do it again on the 10th.

A.   They met with Dr. Little.  Dr. Little was the appointed chair of the scientific advisory committee of the TIRC.

Q.   Okay.

A.   And they met with Larson and Haag from American -- I think if you go up top, because they were scientists who later spoke on issues related to smoking and health from the Medical College of Virginia.  And so they also met with them and -- and that's relevant because they later put out a book on smoking and health issues.

Q.   All right.  So you -- you alluded to it, very top.  I want to -- I want to get the very top in No. 1. So you alluded to it, what they were doing.

"From our contacts in the U.S. and Canada, we sought information on the following:  No. 1, the extent to which it is accepted that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer."

And let's see what they said about their results.  Would you please read that highlighted portion?

A.   Yeah.

"Under causation of lung cancer, with one

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=208
1577

exception" -- that was Dr. Greene, the pathologist at Yale -- "the individuals whom we met believed that smoking causes lung cancer, if by causation we mean any chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer and which involves smoking as an indispensable link.  In the U.S., only Berkson apparently is now prepared to doubt the statistical evidence, and his reasoning is" --

Q.   Nowhere.

A.   -- "nowhere thought to be sound."

Q.   Did the industry ever tell the American public at this timeframe that they agreed cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

A.   No.  They did not.

Q.   They �

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  If we're

going to leave this document, may I have the rest of

the paragraph be read, please? MR. CLARK:  Sure. THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Hueper of the National Cancer Institute accepts that cigarette smoking is capable of causing lung cancer, but believes that as compared with other environmental carcinogens, the contribution of smoking to the total mortality from lung cancer is being greatly

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=209
1578

exaggerated."

Hueper -- Hueper was of the National Cancer Institute.  Inside the industry, did they know cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

A.   Yes, and Hueper did too.  He believed that it caused lung cancer.

There was a debate about how many lung cancers were caused by cigarette smoking, but there is no debate in 1958 among any of these folks, except for Dr. Greene, that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer.  And that was something they continued to deny for the next � until 2000.

Q.   Are we going to see opportunities that they had to come clean and tell this information that they knew?

A.   They had an opportunity every day of -- from this point on to tell the American public and their consumers that they knew their products caused cancer, and they chose not to do that.

Q.   I know I've come to it every once in a while, but knowing that these companies knew their product caused cancer, in the '50s, in the late '50s, were they still researching the youth smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You mentioned it earlier, the William Esty Company, PT1533.  Did they do research on youth

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=210
1579

marketing?

A.   Yeah, they studied --

Q.   On behalf of what company?

A.   Well, this is R.J. Reynolds.  William Esty, as I mentioned before, was the advertising company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco.  And they commissioned studies to be done of high school and college students, actually junior high, high school, and then college students to assess smoking and what brands of cigarettes were the most popular brands at the time.

Q.   This is 1959, Youth Research Institute 1959 cigarette smoking study among high school and college students.

"Preference wise, Camel and Winston are shown as holding their shares substantially constant, while Salem increased its share, especially among high school students."

Who made Salem?

A.   R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   How popular were Camel and Winston in the late 1950s among high school students?

A.   Very popular.  Obviously, the filtered -- the unfiltered cigarettes began to fall off over time and they were replaced with a filter brand, with Winston become the top-selling brand among high school students

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=211
1580

as well as young adults.  It really took off.  And then Winston -- or then Marlboro pretty much followed that trend.  But began to dominate sales in the late '60s and early '70s as they reformulated their product to give it more kick.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT3570. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Is this the actual research report that accompanied that cover letter?

A.   Yes.  And what you'll see, this is a 1959 report, but they had done the survey in 1958 and 1959. So you'll see comparisons of trends over those two years.  So, you know, it was showing just a fair amount of research was being commissioned by R.J. Reynolds to track the smoking habits of junior high students as well as college students.

Q. All right. Tell us what we're looking at here, Dr. Cummings. Please explain how this is significant to your opinions regarding � I just � sorry. Lost it for a second.

A.   Sure.  I could tell you the significance of this is when you look at high school students in, you know, 1958, '59, you can look at the prevalence of smoking, and it's pretty high.  And, you know, it's the 56 and 58 percent and higher among young men.  So

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=212
1581

showing you how common cigarette smoking was.  You know, over 60 percent of young men, you know, were reporting themselves.

These were not small surveys.  These were, you know, tens of thousands -- or, you know, several thousand smokers you can see in each of the years.

And then when you go down to the junior -- you know, the freshman and sophomore classes in high school, the rates are lower.  So this is not uncommon.

As you get older, you see higher prevalence, but still pretty high even in junior � you know, freshman and sophomore year, 42, 46 percent.  So that's showing you how common, you know, cigarette smoking is.

And, you know, they commented on the brands, and the brands that were popular were the brands from R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris.

Q.   All right.  Back to the research that the companies were doing.

MR. CLARK:  This is PT2141, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We already talked about Kenneth Hoover.  This is November 2nd, 1959.  The title is "The Optimum Composition of Tobacco and Its Smoke."

What's going on here, Dr. Cummings?  Will you read this, please?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=213
1582

A.   Sure.  This is a -- you want me just to read it?

Q.   Yes, sir.

A.   Sure.

"Some 30-odd polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have since been similarly characterized in these labs."

Q.   Stop right there.

So they � they've now got 30 � 30 � 30-odd something of these carcinogens that they've identified in cigarette smoke?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Keep reading.

A.   "Of these, eight are carcinogenic to mouse epidermis."

That's the skin painting.

"And cholanthrene, a potent carcinogen, is one of the -- these not yet reported by other investigators."

Because again they're commenting some of these have been published in the scientific literature, but others, like this one, had been isolated and hadn't yet been reported.  Isolated.  Reynolds knew it was there, but they hadn't reported it.

Q.   And when did Reynolds advise the government, the Surgeon General, the public health community or its

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=214
1583

consumers they had identified that potent carcinogen in cigarette smoke?

A.   Well, I mean, the cigarette companies --Philip Morris did send a list of the chemicals when the Surgeon General's advisory committee asked the companies to supply their research to them in 1963.  So there was a list of the, you know -- large list of chemicals identified.

But what was not reported, which is indicated in this particular memo and others, is that they could not remove the carcinogens that were identified in --and remember Dr. Dupuis had said if we ever find anything harmful in cigarettes, we'll take it out.  And you see that as a common statement made over and over and over again.  And they knew there were carcinogens in the product, and they knew through their technology that they could not remove the carcinogens.

Q.   They -- they -- they identified it in -- four or five years later down the road.  And did I hear you right, they also told the Surgeon General's advisory committee that filters would remove this stuff?

A.   They said that they felt filters would remove it, even though, again, their internal documents pretty much say that filtration of cigarettes is an illusion and a fraud.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=215
1584

Q.   Let's go to page 4.  They also talk about nicotine in this document.

A.   They do.  They're talking about the optimum composition of the smoke.  So what they actually say the optimum composition is to remove all of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and they point out that they can't take them all out.  That was what I was just commenting on.

And then they're talking about nicotine.  And actually, this document is relating to reconstituted, the manmade tobacco where they extract things.  And they said if we take or try to extract things out of the product, we need to replace the nicotine.  And they say, "The physiological requirements of the smoker with respect to nicotine can be met by the application of the optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted tobacco."

Q.   And who wrote -- who wrote this report?

A.   This is written by Alan Rodgman, who had done a massive amount of work to try to figure out how to remove carcinogens, the polycyclics, and essentially, he is telling his boss Ken Hoover, We can't remove all of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as long as you burn the product at a certain temperature.

I think that's probably shown in this document, if we go back.

Q.   Well, what was --

MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Move to

strike.  The question was who wrote this report.

Move to strike after Alan Rodgman.  Nonresponsive. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let me ask you, Dr. Cummings --

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll sustain the objection.

If you could �

MR. CLARK:  I'm going to ask the question. BY MR. CLARK:

Q. What was Dr. Rodgman's conclusions about R.J. Reynolds' ability to remove carcinogens from cigarette smoke?

A.   His conclusion was you couldn't remove them as long as you burn a cigarette like you normally burn a cigarette and it burns at a high temperature.

Q.   Do we also -- "we consider the zero level to be impossible to achieve."  Zero level of carcinogens.

A.   Of polycyclics he's talking about.

Q.   "To be impossible to achieve as long as the combustion temperature of the cigarette is greater than 700 degrees Celsius."

A.   Correct.  And a cigarette normally burns at a much higher rate, particularly when you're actively puffing it and you see the cone at the end get hot.

pgNbr=217
1586

Q.   Is Philip Morris -- well, strike that. Who is Helmut Wakeham?

A.   He's the -- Helmut Wakeham is the director of research at Philip Morris in the early '60s.

MR. CLARK:  We have his picture, Baron? BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   There he is.  And you said he -- he was what?

A.   He was the director of research and development for Philip Morris tobacco company.  Previously, that had been Dr. Dupuis.  Dr. Dupuis left Philip Morris at the end of the 1950s, and he was replaced by Helmut Wakeham.

MR. CLARK:  PT3681, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   What is this document, have you seen it before?

A.   Yes.  This is Dr. Wakeham's presentation to the R&D committee on tobacco and health.  And 1961, an internal business document at Philip Morris, again, much like Reynolds, talking about carcinogens that have been isolated in cigarette smoke and their inability to remove all -- you know, all of the carcinogens given their technology.

Q.   And this is 1961.  Let's take a look at what Dr. Wakeham says about how he defines carcinogens.

"The cancer controversy, some definitions. Carcinogen, a substance which applied to the tissue of a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=218
1587

test animal gives rise to tumor formation.  In tests for carcinogens, it is assumed that tumors ultimately lead to cancerous growths and that a carcinogen so demonstrated in test animals is dangerous to man."

Does he identify some carcinogens that they have identified in cigarette smoke?

A.   Yeah, he presents a list.  He calls it a partial list of carcinogens.

And now you can see, you know, it's 1961. They're isolating a lot more chemicals.  A lot -- a lot of different classes of chemicals.

And so you can see like the benzo[a]pyrene that's got a 4 and a little plus sign represent how potent in these animal models that the carcinogen is in causing cancer when it's painted onto the back of the mouse.

Q.   I'm not going to try to pronounce those.  Fair to say Philip Morris has identified a significant number of carcinogens in cigarette smoke by 1961?

A.   Philip Morris has identified them.  Reynolds has identified them.  The other companies.  And, of course, you're getting scientists and academic centers also identifying chemicals in the product.  So there's a lot of nasty chemicals.  More and more are being found, and the significance of this document is Dr. Wakeham is

telling others in the R&D department.

MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Pretrial ruling, interpretation versus factual.

THE COURT:  Counsel, response?  You want to approach the bench?

MR. CLARK:  We want to approach.

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

MS. YATES:  Your Honor �

MR. CLARK:  She's already made the objection. My only reason for wanting to approach, Your Honor, was simply to make sure that we don't get into a speaking objection situation.  I was about to say I'm going to ask the next question and move it on. So �

MS. YATES:  I was saying the pretrial ruling, and then we can approach.  The specific one I'm referring to, the Court agrees that if the document speaks for itself, that they are not going to go beyond that as to what the meaning was or what the intent was.  So that's the pretrial ruling.

Going forward, I would say just pretrial ruling, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You know, as an expert, he can

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=220
1589

explain meaning.  Perhaps not going into intent.

MR. CLARK:  He's not going to go into the intent of the author.

THE COURT:  Well, if he's referring here as to -- are you asking about the specific carcinogens?

MR. CLARK:  I had asked him about those and where I was going to move on to next was a subsequent page about his recommendation on the effect or the ability to remove them.  So that's where we're going.

My only reason for really wanting to be up here is just to make sure we don't get into a speaking objection situation.

THE COURT:  Absolutely.  But also, I don't want to make a bench conference.  So a relevancy objection or beyond the scope or something.  And I'll deal with it.

MR. CLARK:  Right.

THE COURT:  So you're going to go into �

MR. CLARK:  I'm moving off of that and moving into something else.

THE COURT:  Okay.  But as to � he's not going to go into that next question then, is that what you're saying?

MR. CLARK:  Yes.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection. MS. YATES:  Thank you, Your Honor. (End of bench conference.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   I was about to ask you �

MR. CLARK:  May it please the Court. THE COURT:  You may proceed. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   I was about to ask you, Dr. Cummings, what I was trying to get to is, does Dr. Wakeham make some conclusions about Philip Morris's ability to remove all these items? A.   Yes. Q.   And let's go to that page, please.

"Carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke.  Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke."

That is the position of Philip Morris -- was that the position of Philip Morris in 1961? A.   Yes.

Q.   When we see it here in just a little bit in 1963, when they respond to the advisory committee at the Surgeon General's request, do they tell the Surgeon General's committee the complete truth about that?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

A.   No.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT3709A. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Again, Dr. Rodgman -- you doing okay?

A.   Yeah, I'm doing fine.

Q.   All right.  So this is Dr. Rodgman and this is in what year?

A.   1962.

Q.   "The Smoking and Health Problem - a Critical and Objective Appraisal."  What is he doing in this particular document?

A.   He's doing an update of the evidence on smoking and health, and he draws some conclusions about the evidence now in 1962, much like Dr. Teague had done in 1953.  Dr. Rodgman actually, you can see, actually previous reports, he would summarize this evidence for senior management at R.J. Reynolds on a regular annual basis, and this is his report in 1962.

Q.   Was this information circulated by Dr. Rodgman to the management of R.J. Reynolds?

A.   Yes.  This was circulated to Dr. Hoover, his boss.  I think Dr. Ram or Mr. Ram, who is the president of the company.  And they were pretty upset actually at the conclusions and so you can see this is a draft, and so they essentially had told them to destroy it.

pgNbr=223
1592

Q.   Let's just read -- let's read -- read what we have here.

"The evidence to date, obviously, the amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an indictment is scant."

That's R.J. Reynolds' internal position in 1962?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we have the next sentence published?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. CLARK:  "However, the evidence" � I'll read it from the book.

"However, the evidence from epidemiological, pathological, biological and chemical studies supporting the proposition that lung cancer is caused by or associated with cigarette smoke is paralleled by similar evidence supporting the proposition that lung cancer is caused by or associated with air pollutants.  In some instances, the evidence seems to be stronger in support of cigarette smoke as a causative or associated factor" -- I kept going.  I'm sorry.

You asked for that sentence, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=224
1593

MR. CARTER:  Can you complete the paragraph?

MR. CLARK:  Sure.  Sure. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "In other instances, the evidence seems to be stronger in support of air pollutants as a causative or associated factor."

Any of this information released by R.J. Reynolds to the public?

A.   No.  And actually to understand that paragraph, you actually need to read the next one.

Q.   Okay.  Well, let's read the next one.

"Any criticism" --

MR. CLARK:  Can you blow that up for me? BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Any criticism leveled at the lung cancer, cigarette smoke proposition, e.g." -- for example --"statistical studies cannot prove cause-and-effeet relationship between two factors.

"A criticism of the epidemiology.  Mice are not men.

"A criticism of the biological evidence. Metaplasia and hyperplasia do not become cancerous.

"A criticism of the pathological evidence.  And no experimental evidence exists to show that any cigarette smoke constituent is carcinogenic to human

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1594

lung tissue at the level present in cigarette smoke.

"A criticism of the chemical evidence. Is equally applicable to the lung cancer air pollutant proposition."

You said you needed to explain that.  Can you please explain that?

A.   Well, if you're going to say that it's not due to cigarette smoking, it's due to some other factor like air pollution like he had suggested in the prior paragraph, then all of those criticisms that he was leveling at cigarette smoke would also have to be leveled at the evidence on lung cancer, and basically, you couldn't do that.

It was -- that's why the summary evidence is --the evidence is overwhelming against cigarette smoking and scant, suggesting that cigarette smoking was not a cause.  So, I mean, it's a detailed summary, about 140 references.  Many internal to the company.

I think the document does speak for itself. It's a good read.

MR. CLARK:  Can you bear with me just one second, Your Honor.

May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. CLARK:  Actually, we don't need to

And you're under the same restrictions as to the recess instruction previously provided to you. All right.  Thank you.

THE BAILIFF:  Court will stand in recess until 1:00.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We want to address anything now during this break?

MR. CARTER:  I think at some point during the lunch break, Your Honor, it would make sense to go through the exhibit objections as to what we anticipate to come up next after lunch.

THE COURT:  I'd rather do it now than to � and get it out of the way.  I've got to go to a meeting for a couple of minutes, but, sir, you may be excused until 1:00.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Take your time.

MR. CLARK:  Step in here for a second, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Who wants to begin?  Where are we or what are the issues?

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge.

One of the exhibits disclosed for use of this witness we think is going to come up is Plaintiff's Exhibit 1681.  This is a video exhibit.  It is an excerpt of "Face the Nation" interview of Joseph Cullman, and during the -- there are several clips that are sometimes played.  There is one particular clip that --

MR. BIGGER:  Let's just play it.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=228
1597

MR. CARTER:  So � well, do you intend to play -- so we can play the clip first and then I think our objection will be obvious.

MR. BIGGER:  My understanding was your objection is only that portion of it.

MR. CARTER:  It is.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So you're not �

MR. BIGGER:  We're going to play it.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  We're going to play -- Your Honor can't really make a decision without seeing the evidence.  We're going to play the evidence.

Just by way of background, Joe Cullman is the president of Philip Morris at the time; is that right?

MR. CLARK:  Yeah.

MR. BIGGER:  President of Philip Morris, the defendant here in the case.  He's also speaking on behalf of the entire industry.  He was, you know, authorized to and sent for the purpose to speak on behalf of the industry on the show "Face the Nation."

I'm sure Your Honor is familiar with Tim Russert, and this is a, you know, long-running news

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=229
1598

show.  So this is being broadcast on live television or at least recorded television or this is what happened on TV for anyone to see.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(The video clip was published as follows:)

"Washington in Color Face the Nation.  A spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Cullman III chairman and chief executive office of Philip Morris, Incorporated, and chairman of the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.

We have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking.  We -- we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.

We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.  Because when as and if any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to human health, we are confident that we could eliminate that ingredient.

Do you believe that cigarettes are safe?  Have they been proved to be safe, Mr. Cullman?

I believe they have not been proved to be unsafe.  I did read that report, and I concluded from that report that it's true that babies born

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=230
1599

from women who smoke are smaller, but they're just as healthy as the babies born from women who do not smoke.  Some women would prefer having smaller babies."

(The video clip concluded.)

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, obviously, the portion we object to is the "some women would prefer having smaller babies."  This is routinely excluded in these cases.

THE COURT:  I don't think that �

MR. CARTER:  It's not an issue in this case. It has no possible relevance to Mr. Barbose, his life and smoking decisions and the 403 issues.

THE COURT:  And Mr. Barbose did not have any small babies, I'm assuming?

MR. BIGGER:  No, sir.  But that's the point of the -- the point of this is that this isn't --today, we look at that and it's appalling, I agree. Of course it's prejudicial.  All evidence in a case is prejudicial.

It's not unduly prejudicial because that was the position that the executive committee chairman of the Tobacco Institute and the chairman of one of these defendants took on public -- he wasn't being like, funny.  That was honestly their position,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=231
1600

their opinion.

And one of the Engle findings in this case that was contested and litigated in Engle is that women have more miscarriages, that lower birth weight babies are one of the things.  Complications of pregnancy is one of the Engle findings.  It's one of the reasons we asked Your Honor to instruct on all of the diseases that were litigated, contested, challenged and proven in Engle.  None of those things were admitted or agreed to.

Now, all of that goes to the reprehensibility of what they were doing.  That they were in spite of all the information they had, they were continuing to carry on this campaign to conceal that information, including the finding that complications of pregnancy are well known -- now, today, well known to be a cause.

THE COURT:  Well, I'm not saying that that should be stricken.  The question that I have is just the gratuitous remark at the end --

MR. BIGGER:  Right.

THE COURT:  -- some women would rather have smaller babies.  I mean, all but that can be admitted, but that part would be stricken.

MR. BIGGER:  Okay.  Thank you, Your Honor.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1601

THE COURT:  And that's January 3, 1971?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. CARTER:  Sticking with video evidence, the next objection we have is to a video.

It's PT1683.  It's an excerpt with John Stossel, and I suppose it depends on which portions they're going to play.  I don't believe it was asked.

Are you going to play -- and may I confer with counsel briefly, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. CARTER:  So yes, we would object.  The portion that is often played is an interview of Anne Browder, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, talking about movie placement in the Superman II portion.  The eight-minute clip goes on to include interviews with smokers and various other noncompany spokespeople.  We would object on hearsay grounds.

Obviously, it's being offered for the truth of the matter asserted.  Those are not statements on behalf of the company.  They can't be imputed to us, and they're not subject to cross-examination.

So there's an obvious hearsay problem.

MR. BIGGER:  Well, you're � hearsay, I'm not

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=233
1602

quite sure of.  But you're going to hear, obviously, from their case.

They're going to put on Harry Reasoner, "See It Now." They're going to play the same kind of stuff. Video clips, news clips.  That sort of thing.

So I don't think it's really -- I can't understand how they can possibly say this is hearsay when it's the same content that was publicly available, "Face the Nation," all these are the same.

Certainly the age of it, it's ancient documents exception, if nothing else.  So it clearly is available under a hearsay exception if that's the objection I'm hearing now.  That sounds like it's the principal objection.

But the other information in it, it's information presented to Anne Browder, who was a key spokesperson for the Tobacco Institute.  She was routinely the one who was sent out to speak in these settings on behalf of the positions of the industry. And John Stossel is interviewing her on behalf of the industry.  They put her up for the purposes of expressing the positions of the industry on these issues.

THE COURT:  And what year is this again?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=234
1603

MR. CLARK:  '83.

MR. BIGGER:  '83.  1983, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  And Mr. Barbose is still alive?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  I mean, they're talking about � one of the things they talk about in Superman, it's a product placement in movies.  And there's a position the industry takes that we don't intentionally place products in movies.

Now that they can't advertise on TV, we don't put products in movies specifically.  Well, unfortunately for Ms. Browder, the documents have now been released that show that what she said on that program was a complete lie.  And I understand why they would not like that to be shown.

But there are documents that show that, in fact, Philip Morris was paying money to put Marlboro all over Superman II?

MR. CLARK:  II.

MR. BIGGER:  Superman II.

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, just to make the record clear, Philip Morris did not put the cigarettes in Superman II.  That was Philip Morris,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=235
1604

International, which is a separate company and not a defendant in this lawsuit.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. CARTER:  And on the hearsay point, if I may before Your Honor watches it, the difference is whether it's being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, whether it actually qualifies as hearsay.  The portions that are played, whether it's "See It Now" or Harry Reasoner, that is news reporting on what had gone on, and it's just the fact that that was disseminated to the public.

Here, as Mr. Bigger's argument just indicated, the purpose of this clip that they want to show is to demonstrate that Ms. Browder was lying, to demonstrate that what she was saying is not true. So it's not a notice to the public.  It is classic hearsay.

They are trying to show that these statements from the testimonials and the other material that is spliced around Anne Browder's comments prove that what she is saying is false.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  I guess I'll watch it.

MR. BIGGER:  You want to play the whole thing? I apologize.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

MR. CARTER:  We can play a bit of it, and I think Your Honor will get a flavor.

THE COURT:  Get a flavor.

MR. BIGGER:  Sure.  That's fine. (The video clip was published as follows:)

"I'm Hugh Downs and this is 20/20.

On the ABC news magazine 20/20 tonight, kids under 21, America's youngsters. Are they the new target for cigarette manufacturers?

Spokesmen for the industry say no, but cigarette advertising is everywhere.  Sporting events, rock and jazz concerts, billboards, magazines and giveaways.

For almost 30 years, the research and the warnings on the many harmful effects of cigarette smoking have multiplied, but where in 1954 the number of cigarettes sold was 387 billion, this year's estimate is 617 billion.

Now, in fact, what may help clarify this odd progression of events is that more money is spent for promoting cigarettes than for any other product. And some of this promotion seems aimed at children.

Smoke anywhere.  You'll enjoy the cigarette of fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike.

It was 12 years ago that cigarettes were banned

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=237
1606

from radio and TV.

I had forgotten what these ads are like. It's amazing to watch them now.

Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

The growing evidence that these products were killing people eventually led to their ban from broadcasting.  But tobacco companies, however, still claim the health hazards haven't been proven.

We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard to appear on this program. None would.

They told us to talk to the Tobacco Institute. The Institute said Anne Browder would speak for them.

The case is still open. The jury has not come in.

It may not be harmful?  You're not convinced.

It may be or it may not be.  We don't know.

How can you say it might not be harmful, yet most of the people who die of lung cancer smoke.  I mean, how can there not be a connection?

We certainly are aware of the fact that people die on a daily basis. Some of them are smokers and some of them are not smokers.

Even though they say they're not convinced that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=238
1607

cigarettes kill, the tobacco companies say they voluntarily cancelled their radio and TV ads before Congress banned them.

We feel very strongly that cigarette smoking is an adult custom that one should not even consider until they've reached the age of maturity.

What's maturity?

Anyone over the age of 21.

But studies show that 80 percent of all smokers started before they were 21.

Cigarette manufacturers are not interested in obtaining new business from teenagers in our society.

But how can you stay in business if you can't hook the kids?

We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting to hook kids. We do everything possible to discourage teenage smoking.

Do they?

Recently, tobacco companies have found new ways to display their -- "

(The video clip concluded.)

MR. BIGGER:  I don't know how much you want to watch, but obviously you're getting a -- this is the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=239
1608

spokesperson.  What she just said right there, you're going to see a 1981 document from Philip Morris from a gentleman named Myron Johnson that says the exact opposite.  Privately, internally, they're saying today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.

You're going to see a document in 1984 from R.J. Reynolds, the same time, recognizing that for the last 50 years, the rise and fall of every major brand has been built upon young smokers starting to smoke and getting their share of the young smoker market.

Calling them replacement smokers in that document.  Recognizing that's what the need is.

I mean, when you see it -- when it's all together and once we have this video and with the rest of the evidence, during closing arguments, the case can honestly be made to the jury, this is the exact lie and concealment campaign that was going on.  They were sending her to say this.

Obviously, in 1983, John Stossel didn't have access to these documents to question her about, but we now have them today.  We can look back today and know that what she is saying there is just frankly a lie.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=240
1609

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I thought I was clear. We do not object to them using the statements of someone who, you know, from the Tobacco Institute. It's if they want to juxtapose her statements to John Stossel with internal documents, that's how it should be done, frankly.

It's the additional five minutes of the video where they then splice in testimonials and, you know, ask a smoker on the street what his view is. It's that that's the hearsay problem.

THE COURT:  I haven't seen any of that, have I?

MR. CARTER:  Not yet, by the sequence plaintiff played.

THE COURT: So far, your objection is overruled. I haven't seen anything that's objectionable here.

MR. CARTER:  Right.

THE COURT:  I think that's all relevant.  I don't know where we're getting into other testimonials.  What they're doing in placement and sponsoring the Virginia Slims Ladies'  Tennis Tournament, Winston Cup, or whatever else they were doing, I think that that is appropriate for the jury to hear about.

MR. BIGGER:  We can keep playing if you want to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

keep going.  But I mean, I don't think it changes. I think it's the same, essentially that type stuff.

MR. CARTER:  If we could skip ahead to the smoker testimonials.

MR. BIGGER:  I believe it's after that.

(The video clip was published as follows:)

"I just went up and asked for cigarettes and they didn't ask me for any ID or anything.  So I just got it and walked away.

Reynolds Tobacco says they fire people who violate the sampling code.  We tried to ask the samplers about all this, but they said they've been told not to talk to the media.

This video tape made last winter by the Chicago Lung Association, shows young people being given Bright cigarettes.  16-year-old Joe was given a pack.  So was Paulette.  She's 18.  And Chris.  He's 19.  Seven of nine young people who asked for cigarettes got them.

So the Chicago Lung Association sent people out to" �

the part that we're talking about.  He's asking questions of Ms. Browder, that's different.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge.

THE COURT:  Anything else?

MR. CARTER:  Yes.  The next document would be Plaintiff's Exhibit 1911.

May I approach to hand you a copy?

MR. CLARK:  We did not come close.  I agree with that.

THE COURT:  All right.  Counsel, argument.

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, Your Honor, just a second. We'll pull this one.  We don't need it.

THE COURT:  All right.  That's a great argument.

MR. BIGGER:  Perfect.

MR. THORNE:  Off to a good start.

MR. CARTER:  Next one, Your Honor, Plaintiff's Exhibit 6188.

May I approach again?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BIGGER:  And just to be clear, Judge, let me clarify that, what I just said.  We're going to pull it for the direct.  I can't say that depending on where they go on their cross.  It might be something we potentially use in redirect.  If we do, recognizing the objection, we'll obviously approach before we do it.

THE COURT:  That's fine.  Understood.

MR. CARTER:  Plaintiff's Exhibit 6188, Your Honor.  This is a one-page draft agenda.  The

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=244
1613

portion that has been used or at least attempted to be used would be under heading one, the coordination of God King.

This is a comment that we expect based on deposition testimony, Dr. Cummings would try to refer to the lawyer head of the committee as the God King and comment further as to how that -- how the industry viewed the lawyers within their ranks.  And it's obviously an inflammatory characterization. This is a draft agenda.

The testimony that we have established is there's no evidence that this was ever actually circulated or used.  This was found in a secretary's drawer.

And there is no testimony Dr. Cummings would establish that this was ever the actual agenda meeting.  And this was a document -- I know we cite prior rulings and what happened before.  This was not in the Engle -- the original Engle trial.  And it's been excluded from a number of trials subsequent to that when use has been attempted.

THE COURT:  Counsel, we need to have this?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes.  You'll hear about the Committee of Counsel, which you haven't heard yet. But the Committee of Counsel is essentially the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=245
1614

heads of the -- the general counsel of all of the companies.  And I've alluded to this before with Your Honor.  But Your Honor is going to regrettably learn, and it was in the summary of the Kessler opinion we gave you, this is a sad chapter as far as, you know, the involvement of lawyers in this process.

And it's not pleasant.  I understand that.  But the reality is that this was done by lawyers.

Research was run by lawyers.  Decisions were made by lawyers as to what research should be done and not knowing the companies.

The ultimate decision makers, you'll see there's a document from 1964, which I don't know if we used, the tobacco one, that this has been going on for a long time.  It's not new.  This is just more evidence of that, that these decisions were being made.

Waxman coming up, you know, the -- the committee of counsel was making decisions.  That was why the heads of the company stood up and they said nicotine is not addictive even though their own documents said otherwise.

These things were being done and orchestrated by this conspiratorial entity, CTR, which was run by

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=246
1615

the committee of counsel.  There was an executive committee, which was the heads of the companies. But committee of counsel was the ones who's really calling all the shots.  And they were the ones who were making decisions about what can and cannot be done.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't have a problem with going into testimony on that.  But if you don't have any testimony that this was actually used, it was just in some secretarial notebook, I don't understand how we're going to be introducing it or how you're going to attempt to introduce it as evidence.

MR. BIGGER:  I had not heard that argument before, Your Honor.  And if I have, I mean, just obviously, would understand the constraints, but may I ask the witness about it to see what the circumstances are?

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I'll reserve ruling on that. I mean, if it was actually used in this committee and there is testimony on that, the Court would be inclined to overrule the objection.  But if it was just sitting as a draft or proposed agenda, I don't know.  I have a problem with that.

MR. BIGGER:  I mean, obviously, I'd like to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=247
1616

know if Mr. Carter's representations to the Court, I'm not saying they're not accurate, but I mean, he's just saying this was found in some secretary's drawer.  I'd love to see the document or where that is established or if that's an affidavit from somebody.

THE COURT:  You guys can talk about that during break.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  And then you can talk to your witness before you attempt -- it's going to be used, approach the bench or we'11 deal with it after lunch.

MR. BIGGER:  Sure.  No problem.

MR. CARTER:  The next group �

MR. CLARK:  Can I stop you for a second.  What was that number?

MR. BIGGER:  6188.

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  Go ahead.  Thank you.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, the next group, there are six documents.  I think they can be dealt with on categorical basis.

It's Plaintiff's Exhibits 2181, 6336, 6337, 6338, and 1051.

Your Honor, our objection has multiple bases.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=248
1617

These documents, we believe that plaintiff will try to use them to make out a story of document destruction.  We think this is -- obviously poses 403 issues, would lead to a mini trial on the full story behind what happened, what did not happen.

It also, if you're going to make a spoliation argument, which is what this would amount to, there needs to be an evidentiary hearing.  Florida law sets out a procedure for having a spoliation argument to establish a claim for spoliation.  And this is attempt to circumvent that, back door it.  Put up these documents.  Let Dr. Cummings extrapolate beyond them, and leave the jury with the impression that there were documents that there was a legal duty to be preserved that were, you know, improperly disposed of.

The first document, for example, 2181, is one-page memo, with the subject line, validation of some reports in the research department.  This is a memo that has extensive, you know, back and forth in prior litigation.

There's a story where -- and Dr. Cummings does know this.  When Reynolds switched from the hard copy filing system to, at the time, the technology of microfilming and microfiche, there was a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=249
1618

procedure instituted by the library for eliminating excess hard copies, making the conversion, et cetera.  There were protocols put in place. Memoranda from the library department and, you know, for this document to get thrown out there to tell one side of the story, leave the jury with, you know, again, what I said was a back door attempt at spoliation.

Then I have to come in on cross, walk through the entire history of the library of protocol, what Dr. Cummings can and cannot establish.  It becomes a needless side show on something that should not be injected in the first place unless there were to be a spoliation hearing and all the procedures of Florida law actually be complied with.

The other documents that follow --

THE COURT:  Let's deal with this individually then.

MR. CARTER:  Okay.

THE COURT:  What you're handing me, too, are all cut off.  I don't see the numbers.  So I'm assuming you're referring to December 18, 1969.

MR. CARTER:  I am, Your Honor.  These are just the images that were provided.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1619

MR. CARTER:  But this is also plaintiff's Exhibit 2181.

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I understand Mr. Carter's position on what he thinks goes to the weight of this evidence.  But the reality is there's been suggestion already made, you'll hear it in the cross-examination, that we were selectively taking, you know, things out and only picking certain documents here and there and that part of the story is missing and we can't establish this or we can't establish that to try and suggest somehow this stuff was not as bad as it appears.

Part of the reason that we have drafts of documents and not finals of documents is because of what you see here in PT2181.  That there is certainly, if not a proven, established practice, but at least a suggestion that the reason certain things are not there and we only have drafts of some things that have been located is because there was a policy within the company of shipping things overseas, destroying them, destroying documents here.

If you read this document, what it says is, "We do not foresee any difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove certain reports from

the research files.  Once it becomes clear that such action is necessary for the successful defense of our present and future suits, we will promptly remove all such reports from our files."

These aren't -- they're not removing things that are like -- these are research reports.  This is the research department.  This isn't like the legal files or whatever.  This is stuff that is in the research and development department.

And they're saying if we need to to defend ourself in future lawsuits, we'll make a decision to destroy this stuff from the research files.

And then down in the paragraph below the numbered paragraph there, "As to the reports which you are recommending to be invalidated, we can cite misinterpretation of data as a reason for invalidation."

I mean, they're coming up with a story.  This is all part of the coverup.

You'll see it in a document here pretty soon after the Surgeon General's report, part of the holding strategy was to defend themselves in ongoing and upcoming litigation.  Part of the reason for that was this.

And so, the fact that things are incomplete or

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=252
1621

in drafts or missing that is pointed out, needs to be explained that we don't have, unfortunately.  You know, this is 1969.

THE COURT:  1969 and the draft of this agenda was 1994?

MR. BIGGER:  That was '94, Your Honor, yes.

For example, there's a document which we have not -- we're not moving.  We're not moving this, but there is another document that talks about the one we just showed, the -- the Rodgman report on the smoking and health proposal -- excuse me -- the --the critical appraisal, objection appraisal.

There's a reason that's the draft and not the final is because in this document, it makes it clear that the documents were destroyed and all that's left is those drafts, which were held by Rodgman.

THE COURT:  Okay.  As the Court understands the facts and the testimony and the evidence that has been presented to date, I feel that this is relevant and would overrule the objection as to the December 18th, 1969 report.

All right.  Next.

We're going try to get some lunch in here, folks, but hurry up.

MR. CARTER:  The next three do go together.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=253
1622

They deal with the same -- similar topic.  It's the one April � it's Plaintiff's Exhibit 6336.  The April 27th, 1970 letter.

This is referred to as the -- deals with these.

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  We'll take the ship out.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  So that's 36 �

THE COURT:  6336, 6337, and 6338.

MR. BIGGER:  Those three, yeah.  So we'll just jettison it out.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Those objections will be sustained and they --

MR. BIGGER:  Well, just to be clear.  I'd rather than have an objection sustained, I was going to be asking to get an order that's going to be used.  What I'm saying is we'll withdraw those documents from our list.

THE COURT:  The Court will note on the record then those three exhibits as noted will be withdrawn.

MR. BIGGER:  Withdrawn, yes, sir.

THE COURT:  That's fine.

There is one more?

MR. CARTER:  Yes, Your Honor, 1051.  It's the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=254
1623

handwritten page, the last one that I just gave Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Yes, it's not dated.

MR. CARTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  This is a document.  You heard, I think, in the prior argument from opposing counsel about shipping documents overseas.  This is a handwritten note that refers to, I believe it's a Philip Morris file.  But it says, Ship all documents to cologne.  Again, I don't think the predicate for any kind of spoliation argument has been satisfied.

MR. BIGGER:  It's similar, Your Honor.  I don't know what -- I don't think -- everyone agrees this is written by the person it's written by, which was Tom Osdene.  I don't think there's any challenge to that.  I believe that's correct, right?

MR. CLARK:  Yeah.

MR. BIGGER:  So I think, you know, as far as the authenticity that it's a handwritten letter, I can see it's their thought initially.

Cologne is -- there was a foreign installation there called INBIFO.  There was a reason that was used.  They shipped everything there essentially when things started to get heated up and the controversy started to decline and there was some

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=255
1624

concern about, you know, things being eventually overturned.  That's what this document relates to, is shipping things over to Germany where it would be beyond the reach of, you know, U.S. subpoenas and things of that nature.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll overrule that objection as to that particular document as noted. And again, it's cut off.  It's 1050 �

MR. BIGGER:  1.

THE COURT:  � 1.

Okay.  Anything further?

MR. CARTER:  There are some additional ones, but I understand Your Honor wants to grab lunch.

THE COURT:  I don't want to keep the jury waiting either.  So what else do we have to deal with?

MR. CARTER:  Do you intend to use 5480? PT5480?

MR. BIGGER:  The FTC.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, PT5480 is a document from the FTC rescinding guidance.  They had previously required a disclosure of the tar and nicotine levels on packages.  So this is dated November 26, 2008, not even arguably covered by the ancient document exception hearsay.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=256
1625

And hearsay in 403 are the objections that we would press.  This is not a business record.  This is not subject to any hearsay exception.  And it would be offered for the truth of the matter asserted.

The quotes that are pulled up on the board that plaintiff intends to use, you see the fourth paragraph starting with, "In addition."

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. CARTER:  I believe that exemplifies the hearsay issue that we have with this document.

THE COURT:  Has there been a request for judicial notice as to this document or --

MR. BIGGER:  No, sir.  But it's a � I mean, it's the same as the public records on the other FTC report.  This is -- you can see the bottom of the website, this is from the FTC's official Government website.

This is a public record.  It qualifies under the public records exception.  It would qualify -- I think it's qualifies under the business records exception unless they can show there's some way that this is not legitimately a document that was put out for press release by the Federal Trade Commission, which I don't think they're contesting that it is.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=257
1626

MR. CARTER:  We're contesting the other requirements of the exception are satisfied. There's no suggestion that they had a duty to issue this press release.

MR. BIGGER:  The FTC had the authority invested by Congress to study the tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes.  That will be established in the testimony.

I don't think Mr. Carter is contesting they didn't have that congressional mandate.  That is the authority they had to monitor these things, and after it was determined that the testing method was falsified and it was producing false and fraudulent results and that lights were not, in fact, light, that's what this relates to.  The fact that the tar and nicotine levels that the Cambridge filter method testing revealed were being manipulated and controlled by the companies by the use of different design features and things of that nature.

And the FTC realized they had been, essentially for the better part of 40 years, had been putting out false and fraudulent information suggesting that there was lights that were actually better or lower tar, when in reality, the smoker didn't get less tar.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=258
1627

Before this, there was a 2001 Monograph 13 study done by the National Cancer Institute.  A lot of things had happened in the science between now and then were essentially the filter fraud was discovered, the light fraud was discovered.  And as part of that, the Government rescinds it's previous guidance on tar and nicotine yields.

That was done by -- it was certainly a duties of what they're doing here as far as public records exception.

MR. CARTER:  I would just note, Judge Day just excluded this document in trial earlier in Pinellas County.  And a previous trial that I was aware of where this was offered, it was the Kiefer trial, and Judge Murphy down in Broward County also excluded it.

MR. BIGGER:  On what grounds did Judge Day --

MR. CARTER:  Business record exception.  It's not -- it doesn't fit under the business record exception, Your Honor.

MR. BIGGER: I said public record. I'm sorry. Public records, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. The Court will overrule the objection and allow this to be introduced under the public records exception.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=259
1628

Anything else?

MR. CARTER:  One more, Your Honor. Exhibit 5834, if plaintiff intends to use that. It's a video exhibit.

MR. BIGGER:  5834.  What's the video?

Just one second, Your Honor.

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, while they're looking, I don't want to hold you up from lunch, but I had a couple more beyond what Mr. Carter had for Philip Morris.  So --

THE COURT:  Okay.  You have to be cognizant of the other court personnel here too.  It's not just me .

MR. THORNE:  I understand, Your Honor.  I just wanted to address you rather than have my --everybody needs lunch.

MR. BIGGER:  We might.  We might.  Yeah, we might use that.  So if you have objections.

MR. CARTER:  Yes, Your Honor, this a Peter Jennings broadcast.  There are no tobacco company representatives, officials interviewed in this. This is -- it purports to be various former sale --field sales agents providing testimony as to who they sampled, who they did not sample.

And so they're hearsay problems, not subject to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=260
1629

the exception.  403, this was also recently excluded in the Ryan Robertson cases.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah, my understanding, Your Honor, the purported -- I'm not sure if that's actually valid.  I believe these individuals were sued for actually being on here as violation of some prior nondisclosure agreement that they had.  These were former employees who were being interviewed about marketing practices of, I think, R.J. Reynolds; is that right?  You want to play it? Just play it.

MR. CARTER:  I'm not -- I'm not saying one way or the other.  I'm just saying that we know, and I don't think anyone contends, that any of these were high ranking officials that would rise to the level of something that would bind the company.

THE COURT:  Okay.

"Peter Jennings Reports.

Good evening and welcome.  This hour is about cigarettes and the people who make them, which means it is about the only product that you can buy virtually anywhere which, when used as directed, kills more than 400,000 Americans every year.

When Reynolds pushed the Joe Camel image in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

marketplace, they focused on convenience stores, the place most underage smokers get their cigarettes. Mike Shah, Amy Lux and Cheryl Roundtree were Reynolds sales reps.

Was there ever any doubt in your mind that it was part of your job to sell cigarettes to teenagers?

I knew it was part of my job to sell cigarettes to anyone that I could.  Not particularly or specifically teenagers, but to anyone, and that would include teenagers.

If you could push R.J. Reynolds cigarettes to 18-years-olds, would you do it?  Would you be expected to do it?

Yes.

16-year-olds?

Yes.

15.

I would say teenagers.  13 and up.

13 and up.  In other words, you -- do you believe that your company expected you to push the product all the way down to 13-year-olds?

Not -- not directly one on one.  By way of promotion and advertising, yes.  Not direct sales. Not from me to you or from me to a 13-year-old, but

We're going to show you the -- I think the argument was the transcript, that what they said wasn't what they said.  We're going to show you the clips we're using is exactly what they said.  You know who these people are now.

So no surprise, we're going to ask you to reconsider having seen the evidence.  And now that you've actually seen the case, we at least need to proffer it.

THE COURT:  How long is that going to take?

MR. BIGGER:  The clips are total � total clips are five minutes.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Then we're still going have the jury come in at 9:00 on Monday then or 9:15? You tell me.

MR. BIGGER:  We can be here anytime you want us here on Monday morning, Your Honor.

MR. CLARK:  To answer your question, 9:00 is fine.  We'll be here early to do it.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's great.

MR. THORNE:  The next one, Your Honor, I believe is 2268.  I'll confirm that.

This is a document which they have partially redacted, but as you can see, this is a meeting of various lawyers and other people at a meeting.  We

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=265
1634

believe, Your Honor, that this document should be excluded.

It was one of the Bliley documents that was referenced before.  We didn't voluntarily waive our privilege on this.  You'll see that there's all kinds of discussions about litigation, and it's classic privilege among lawyers having discussion about defending themselves.

And as the Court knows, the company can't be held liable for defending itself in court.  It's also hearsay within hearsay.

There are numerous discussions and comments about Bill Shinn and other people.  Bill Shinn was a former partner of mine at the law firm.

We think those references at a minimum to litigation should be redacted.

MR. BIGGER:  This has already been argued.  I'm not sure why we're arguing again.  You heard the Bliley stuff.  It was a motion in limine.  It was overruled.  It was -- it was denied.  So I don't know why we're revisiting this one in particular.

But this document is -- again, these are people who are all the general counsels, this is the committee of counsel of the companies.  These are meetings they're having.  It's part of the CTR file.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=266
1635

This is the Council for Tobacco Research.  This is the industry shield, is the language they use in there.  And they identify the fact that this whole thing was set up as industry shield.

We have the document up on the screen.  I guess Your Honor has copy of it.

THE COURT:  Yes, I do.

MR. BIGGER:  This is in 1978.  It's in the midst of the conspiracy.  You can see the sections we have highlighted here.  They're recapping what they had done over the last approximately 30 years.

CTR began as an organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Counsel.  It was set up as an industry shield in 1954.

CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information which was needed at court trials.  Supplied spokesmen for the industry congressional hearings.

The money spent provides a base for introduction of witnesses.

Special projects are the best ways monies are spent.  That's that individual Bill Shinn.  He's not identified as Shook Hardy.  We've taken all those references out.

On these projects, CTR has acted as a front.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=267
1636

So they're identifying what's the purpose of this organization was.  These were set up as front organizations, these entities, CTR and the Tobacco Institute, to be the sort of face, if you will, the spokesperson, the fronts for these companies.

And it's not -- again, it's not a pleasant subject matter, but it's what they did.  This is part of the ongoing fraud and the concealment.

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, this was � has numerous references to the fact that our -- that CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information, which was needed at court trials.

That kind of information is the kind of information that should be excluded.  Because as the Court knows, we can't be held liable for defending ourselves in court.

These are the kind of documents that shouldn't come in before this jury because we have a right to defend ourselves.  We have a right to have witnesses.  We have a right to discuss litigation and documents.  And those are not the kind of documents that should be shown to this jury.

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, they have a right to defend themselves in this courtroom.  But what was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=268
1637

going on in the past is that these organizations, during the concealment and the fraud, during the conspiracy, part of what they were doing was to put up witnesses for litigation.

That was during -- you can't -- you can't commit fraud and say, oh, we were just defending ourselves in litigation.  So it's okay.

That is not valid.

The Engle finding is that the fraud was going on.  This is part of the fraudulent concealment, and it was done by and through and orchestrated by lawyers.  And that's just the reality of it.

The general counsel of these companies, who was at this meeting with their outside lawyers, were the ones who were doing all this.

If they want to say -- if they want to establish they called Dr. Raub or Dr. Hayes, and they want to say, now, you're not paid by CTR, you haven't accepted any money from CTR, have you?

If they're concerned about it, they can ask those questions of their witnesses.

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, any reference to providing witnesses for congressional hearings or for litigation is the exact kind of thing that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies to because we

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=269
1638

could -- under the First Amendment, we can petition the government, including congressional hearings. And so that's not the kind of thing we can be held liable for.

THE COURT:  Why is this any different than the Court's previous arguments that I've already ruled on this exact document and we agreed that your former partner, Mr. Shinn, was going to be a reference to who he associated with was to be redacted?

MR. THORNE:  Well, Your Honor, that was a different issue.  And the Court did rule on that as to whether Shook, Hardy & Bacon should be removed from any documents they're going to use.  And there are others where -- where that name appears.

But this a separate issue dealing with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and our right to have witnesses and defend ourselves in litigation, our right to defend ourselves and petition the Government and congressional hearings.

And at a minimum, those portions of those documents should be redacted.  And it's hearsay within hearsay in some of it.

MR. BIGGER:  Just to put a final point on it. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine is something that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=270
1639

applies to antitrust proceedings.  I don't even know how it gets raise at these motions in limine.  No judge that I know of anywhere in any of these cases has ever made any ruling on the basis of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.

There is no First Amendment right to lie.  You don't have a First Amendment right to commit a fraud.  And I'm sorry, but that's the fact.

This document is evidence of a fraud.  There is no First Amendment right to lie to people.

You can't defend yourself and say, well, I'm just speaking my mind.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Court is going to overrule the objection.

Anything further?

MR. THORNE:  Your Honor, I have a couple redaction issues that I think I'll take up with Mr. Bigger rather than take the Court's time.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Can we give everyone a break?

Now, it's only going to be 20 minutes for lunch.  All right.

Be back at 1:00.  Thank you.

PROCEEDINGS (Court called to order at 1:09 p.m.) THE COURT:  We're back on the record. Counsel, do you have an announcement? MR. CARTER:  If I can speak for Mr. � we were just conferring on what will be read into the record.  We're not going to hold the jury up. THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  We can do it later. THE COURT:  Have the jury brought in. THE BAILIFF:  Jury entering the hearing of the Court.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

(Jury entered the courtroom at 1:11 p.m.) THE BAILIFF:  All jurors present, Judge. THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to continue with direct examination. Counsel, you may proceed. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, before we broke, we were talking about some of the research that the tobacco companies had been conducting in the late 1950s and the early 1960s.  And what I want to turn to now is kind of usher in the age of the Surgeon General and the Surgeon

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=277
1646

General reports.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Briefly, if you could, basically tell the jury how the Surgeon General's advisory committee in the early 1960s came to be and what, basically, their mandate was.

A.   Sure.  Well, they came to be because President John F. Kennedy, at one of his news conferences in 1962 -- actually, May of 1962, was asked by a reporter about a report that had been put out by the Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom, and had concluded that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.  And he was asked what the position of the United States was on that.  And President Kennedy said he didn't really know the issue and he would look into it.

Two weeks later, then, the Surgeon General, Luther Terry, announced that there would be an advisory committee of scientists who would look into the issue and put out a report.  And that process began, really, from that point on in June of 1962.  Ten members were identified to serve on the advisory committee.  They deliberated over from June, really, until the report came out in January 11, 1964.  And so that's how it came about.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=278
1647

And, of course, the industry, as I indicated, was asked to turn over all research that they had that was relevant to the deliberations of the committee.

Q.   And that's where I was going with it.

So what was sources was the Surgeon General's advisory committee looking at to answer the question regarding cigarette smoking and its relation to health?

A.   Well, they were looking at published literature, as well as any internal business records from the companies.  They asked each of the companies to turn over their research.  They asked the Tobacco Industry Research Committee to turn over anything that would be relevant to the deliberation of the advisory committee.  And those requests went out in the spring of 1963.  Most of the report was really written during the summer.  The plan was to issue the report in November.  President Kennedy was, of course, assassinated in November of 1963, and they delayed the release of the report until January 11th.

MR. CLARK: One second, Your Honor. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   So in the process of asking the companies to provide information to the advisory committee, was there some discussions internal to the industry regarding what information might be provided and what

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=279
1648

information they had?

A.   Yes.  We now know that there were discussions that went on internally, because there are internal documents that talk about what they would turn over, what they would withhold from the advisory committee. So you can see those documents.

MR. CLARK:  PT3615, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And the date of this is July 17th, 1963, labeled "Strictly Private and Confidential: Implications of Battelle Hippo I and II and the Griffith filter."

Who's the author of this document?

A.   This is a lawyer by the name of Addison Yeaman.  He was the chief general counsel of Brown & Williamson.  He was also -- had a law committee that oversaw the activities of the Council for Tobacco Research, and he was the chairman of that committee. MR. CLARK:  If you'll turn to Bates 4,

please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   So if you'll read that, the first top two lines there, please.

A.   Sure.

"Moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=280
1649

then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug."

Q.   And that is the words of Brown & Williamson's general counsel in 1963.  And did they provide this document or that information when the Surgeon General's advisory committee asked for it?

A.   No.

Q.   If you'll continue reading on, please.

A.   Sure.

So "We're in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms, but cigarettes, we will assume the Surgeon General's committee to say, despite the beneficient effects of nicotine, have certain unattractive side effects.  They cause or predispose to lung cancer.  They contribute to certain cardiovascular disorders.  They may well be truly causative in emphysema," et cetera, et cetera.

Q.   I'll keep reading it, then I'll ask you a question about it.

"We challenge those charges and we have assumed our obligation to determine their truth or falsity by creating the new tobacco research foundation.  In the meantime, we say, here is our triple or quadruple or quintuple filter capable of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=281
1650

removing whatever constituent of smoke is currently suspect, while delivering full flavor and, incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine.  And if we are the first to be able to make and sustain that claim, what price can't."

Did we not see yesterday documents from American Tobacco revealing that they had the ability to remove nicotine as far back as the 1930s?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And here in 1963, was anyone outside of the industry aware of this information just written about by Addison Yeaman?

A.   No.  These -- Addison Yeaman is summarizing Battelle Hippo studies.  Hippo stands for hippocampus of the brain.  These were very sophisticated studies that Brown & Williamson and British American Tobacco had funded at Battelle laboratories over in Switzerland.  And in summarizing their research which had determined the answer to the question why people smoke, they smoke for nicotine, and nicotine is addictive and they're in the business of selling nicotine.  That's what he's summarizing.

Q.   Is that a true statement, nicotine is addictive and they're in the business of selling nicotine?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=282
1651

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, are you familiar with --

MR. CLARK:  Throw it up, PT978. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Again, no e-mail back then?

A.   No.

Q.   This is an outgoing cable, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, dated July 3rd, 1963, to Mr. McCormack.

Who's Mr. McCormack?

A.   He's Mr. Yeaman's boss over in -- at the British American Tobacco.  And they're talking about turning over the Battelle Hippo studies, whether they should turn those over, and report the results of those studies to the advisory committee.  And Mr. Yeaman points out that his boss at Brown & Williamson, Mr. Finch, who's the president of Brown & Williamson, has advised against that.

Q.   So Finch agrees submission Battelle or Griffith's developments to Surgeon General undesirable and we agree continuance of Battelle work useful, but disturbed at its implications re cardiovascular disorders.

A.   Right.  Nicotine is a stimulant, speeds up heart rate.  And if you have a blockage, that's not a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=283
1652

good thing to do.

Q.   Now, did the industry recognize they were going to have to provide something to the Surgeon General's advisory committee?

A.   Yes.

Q. And are you familiar with some correspondence regarding attorneys representing Brown & Williamson in May of 1963 regarding how they were going to respond?

A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  That's PT1524, please. BY MR CLARK:

Q.   May 6, 1963, strictly private and confidential.

Who was Devon Bryant?

A.   He was a lawyer for Brown & Williamson, so he was in the legal department of Brown & Williamson.  And their outside counsel in this case, Mr. Johnston, is writing to him about what they should be turning over to the advisory committee.

Q.   And who's Jim Raveline?

A.   Excuse me?

Q.   He's mentioned in the paragraph that's highlighted, Jim Raveline?

A.   I don't know.

Q.   "Pursuant to my telephone conversation with

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=284
1653

you and Jim Raveline on Friday and my conversation with you today, please find enclosed the substance of a proposed letter to the Surgeon General's advisory committee on smoking and health.

"I am of the further opinion that any description in the letter to the committee of the methods and steps involved in the various scientific research programs conducted by Brown & Williamson must necessarily be so vague and incomplete as to be irksome to the reader.  I repeat, it is unfortunate that Brown & Williamson must submit anything, but this approach seems to me to be the most innocuous of the alternatives.

"Please remind the jury what they promised to do in the Frank Statement regarding cooperation."

A.   They said they would work with public health officials on any issues related to smoking and health so they would be cooperative with public health officials.

MR. CARTER: Your Honor, before we leave that page, may I have the next paragraph under the rule of completeness, please?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. CLARK:  "I enclose"?

MR. CARTER:  Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=285
1654

MR. CLARK:  "I enclose a copy of Bowman

Gray's letter about which I spoke to you.

Reynolds' handling of the matter is, of course,

simplified by it being in a position to deliver a

considerable amount of published matter." MR. CARTER:  Thank you. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   What is the status of Brown & Williamson at this time today?

A.   They're owned by -- they were acquired by R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   The defendant in this case -- one of the defendants in this case?

A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Go back to the page, Baron, you

were on. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "From a litigation standpoint, I believe it axiomatic that it is best to submit the least scientific material possible consonant with the objective of not irritating the committee."

Did the industry provide the Surgeon General, the top office of those who had promised that it would cooperate with, the information that it knew from Dr. Rodgman and Dr. Teague and Dr. Wakeham?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=286
1655

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was this at this point in time an opportunity for the tobacco industry, including these two defendants, to come clean with what they knew?

A.   Yes.  It was an opportunity to share everything that they knew and to work cooperatively with public health officials.  And they chose not to do that.

Q.   They rejected that opportunity?

A.   They did.

Q.   Now, let's take a look at the Philip Morris submission to the committee.

MR. CLARK:  That's PT2817. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is to James Hundley, Assistant Surgeon General for Operations, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D.C., May 20th, 1963.

Was this a cover letter to their submission?

A.   Yes.  They have a whole list of chemicals identified in cigarette smoke that they provided to the committee, and this is just a cover letter to that list.

Q.   "None of the chemical substances listed therein, to our knowledge, has been found by scientific research to be harmful to the health of the smoker in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=287
1656

amounts reported in smoke.  It is possible, of course, to modify the chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of filters."

How does that statement compare to what Helmut Wakeham presented to the research committee in 1961?

A.   It's inconsistent with Dr. Wakeham's conclusion that they couldn't remove all the harmful chemicals, and filtration wasn't a solution to doing that.

Q.   The top right there, those are the two conclusions by Dr. Wakeham.  1961, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   "Carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds of smoke.  Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke."

Yet, they told the Surgeon General's committee -- or the Surgeon General, the Assistant Surgeon General, that it is possible to modify the chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of filters.  And they're referring to the carcinogens?

A.   Right.  We know that the filtered products actually have more carcinogens because they shifted the blend.  That's why Winston was more carcinogenic.

MS. YATES:  For optional completeness, Your

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=288
1657

Honor, if we could continue reading from the document that was up?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. CLARK:  Continue reading where?

MS. YATES:  Right where you leave off.

MR. CLARK:  What, "our"?

MS. YATES:  Yes, "our research department."

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  Put that up, Baron.  So she wants to start -- she wants to start at "our."

"Our research department has studied intensively over a period of many years the effects of different filters upon the particulate and gaseous components of smoke.  The considerable experience in smoke filtration gained from this continuing effort has convinced us that the tar and nicotine content of filtered smoke can be substantially controlled.  It has also convinced us that if and when it shall appear from reliable scientific research that particular substances in smoke are a pharmacological significance in the amounts in which they are present, we can develop methods either to remove them or to reduce their concentrations to insignificant levels."

Good enough, Counsel?

MS. YATES:  Might as well finish it, Counsel.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=289
1658

MR. CLARK:  Sure.

"We shall be glad to discuss these matters at

greater length if desired." BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And that's signed by Robert P. Roper, executive vice president of what?

A.   Philip Morris.

A different Roper than the Roper Fautz.

Q.   So let me go back to a part of that that I read.

Right there in the middle, "It has also convinced us that if and when it shall appear from reliable scientific research that particular substances in smoke are of pharmacological significance in amounts in which they are present, we can develop methods either to remove them or reduce their concentrations."

Let's talk about nicotine.  Is nicotine a pharmacological substance in the cigarette smoke?

A.   Absolutely.

Q.   And do we know from reviewing their internal documents that long before 1962 -- 1962 or '63, they had the ability to reduce that to levels that would not addict smokers?

A.   Yes.  They were doing studies internally at

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=290
1659

this time, 1961, '62, on very-low-nicotine content cigarettes which they created in the lab through their extraction methods and tested, but not for commercial application, so they never sold it to consumers.

Q.   The Surgeon General's report, it was released, you said, when?

A.   January 11, 1964.

Q.   And how significant of a news media event was that?

A.   It was a big story at the time.  So it was a big story.

Q.   Was it covered by the CBS News?

A.   Yeah.  All the major networks covered it, so, you know, they had the -- the report was issued on a Saturday.  And so all the major networks -- there were only three back then -- did like half-hour shows on the report and, of course, it was major news in newspapers and later got picked up in magazine articles and so on. So it was a big report.

Q.   And who was Harry Reasoner?

A.   He was a news correspondent at CBS News, so he was sort of the anchor for that show at the time.

Q.   How popular?

A.   Very popular.

Q.   Is there like a modern-day equivalent, maybe?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=291
1660

A.   Well, I mean, Harry Reasoner predated Walter Cronkite.  So Walter Cronkite certainly was well known and --

Q.   Did Harry Reasoner have a large fan base? A.   Sure.

Q.   If they would have told the truth and came clean about what they knew at that point in time, was this an opportunity to reach millions and millions and millions of Americans with the complete story? A.   Yes.

Q.   And they didn't take that opportunity, did they?

A.   They chose not to.

MR. CLARK:  Let's take a look at this CBS News report.

It's PT1685 CA.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"About $170 million a year is spent to advertise cigarettes in all possible ways, including radio and television.  So any news which seems likely to affect smoking habits is major news for the country as a whole or the citizen as an individual.  So far in the developing concern about smoking and health, the national reaction

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=292
1661

has been to keep smoking.

"It has been noted that today's report is a culmination of a great many studies and a great deal of concern.  It is as close as we can come in this country to an official and impartial statement of the facts, but it is also a beginning rather than an end.  What happens now is the process of decision on what to do about it by government agencies, by the tobacco industry, by advertising media, newspapers and magazines, radio and television.

"CBS announced today that it is undertaking an immediate study of the report and will reexamine its advertising standards in light of the findings.  ABC and NBC made similar statements.  In addition, CBS, through its representative on the television poll review broad will participate in a study of industry standards later this month.

"Above all, every American who smokes and every American youngster who is thinking of smoking must now consider whether to stop or not to start.  It comes down to a subjective question. There is no question but what smoking has meant a great deal to a great many people.  An old smoker

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=293
1662

never forgets how he started and, through the lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring companion.  The familiar slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of our lives.  It's like being told that an old friend has all along been betraying you.  In a case like that, you give the old friend every possible chance before you finally decide to believe what you have been told and, maybe even then, you give him a chance to reform.

"In this kind of a country, it comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him either.  The decision is his, the decision and the health that maybe depend on it.

"This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night." (Video clip concluded.)

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We're going to come back to this particular

episode in a minute, but I want to move just forward

for a couple of weeks.

Was there any internal discussions as to the

effect of the publicity regarding the Surgeon General's

report on sales?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=294
1663

A.   Yes.  There were discussions internal to the companies.  And actually the law committee of the tobacco companies met within -- I think the report came out on Saturday.  They were meeting on Monday, met every week, proposed some things that went on to try to mute the effects down the line.  But certainly within Philip Morris, within a couple of weeks, George Weissman is speaking to his boss, Joe Cullman, about the public relations campaign going forward.

MR. CLARK:  PT9399, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Is this the document you're referring to?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mr. Joseph Cullman, III, to George Weissman. We've already talked about George Weissman.  I don't know if we've talked about Joseph Cullman.  Who was he?

A.   At this time, he's the president of Philip Morris.  And he's also on the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.

Q.   This is dated January 29, 1964, and he is talking about, "Some of my thoughts regarding the recent release of the surgeon's report," which was about three weeks before; right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   "Reaction.  While the propaganda blast was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=295
1664

tremendous" -- was the Surgeon General's report a propaganda blast?

A.   No.

Q.   -- "and the penetration of public opinion very widespread, I have the feeling that the public reaction was not as severe, nor did it have the emotional depth I might have feared."

So what does he go on to say here?  Your turn to read, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Sure.  This is under the public relations program.  The context is both Weissman, who's on the communication committee of TI and is speaking to his boss, Joe Cullman, who's on the executive committee. And under public relations program, they say, "The restraint and unity of the industry has been very effective in this period.  The opponents have had their inning.  The industry has demonstrated its seriousness and responsibility in saying they would study the report.  However, at some point, reflecting the same seriousness with which we met the report, we must in the near future provide some answers which will give smokers a psychological crutch and a self rationale to continue smoking."

Q.   That is what Philip Morris said three weeks after the Surgeon General's report?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=296
1665

A.   Yeah, it's what they said and what they actually ended up doing.

Q.   That's what I was about to ask you.  What did they -- did they give smokers a psychological crutch and self rationale to keep smoking?

A.   Well, they reupped the cigarette controversy. So they poured more money into the Tobacco Institute to try to keep the controversy going.  In addition, they continued their mass marketing of their products, particularly highlighting their filtered products, the effectiveness of filters, and later the introduction shortly afterwards of lower -- so-called lower tar and nicotine cigarettes, which also turned out to be a fraud.

MR. CLARK:  Baron stole my thunder.  I was

going to use the board, but he put it up. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We see the dip in sales right after 1963. Was that because of the Surgeon General's report?

A.   Yeah.  I had mentioned earlier after the report came out in January, February and into early March, there was a slight dip in cigarette sales that quickly rebounded and cigarette sales again continued to go up after -- after the report.  But for a few months, there was a decline.  People were trying to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=297
1666

quit smoking and most ended up relapsing back to smoking.

Q.   Back to the CBS news clip, did the industry put a spokesperson on to be interviewed that particular night?

A.   Sure.  I mean, there were interviews done of public health officials at the time the report came out, but also there were industry spokespeople.  So on CBS, Howard Cullman, who was on the board of directors of Philip Morris -- and he was also the president of the Tobacco Merchants Association -- appeared on CBS to respond to questions on the report that had just come out.

MR. CLARK:  And this is PT1685AA, for the

record.

Let's play this clip and see what he says. (A video clip was played to the jury in open

court.)

"This is a CBS News extra on smoking and

health, the findings of the Surgeon General's

committee.

In our studio this afternoon, following the

Surgeon General news conference, CBS news

correspondent Richard C. Hottelet put some

questions to one of the leading spokesmen for the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=298
1667

industry, Howard Cullman, president of the Tobacco Merchants Association and a long-time director of Philip Morris company.  Mr. Cullman, prominent in the New York theater and civic affairs, is a third-generation member of a tobacco family.

Mr. Cullman, the conclusions are pretty stark and pretty solid.  They say, quite frankly, the --they express the judgment that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and the overall death rate.  Then they have a rate ten times higher for smokers in the case of lung cancer and rather higher in other cases.

Well, it's awful hard to define the word substantial.  I don't believe that most people who smoke get lung cancer.  We are now in an era, as you know, of moderation.  We eat more carefully. We have cholesterol habits.  We have drinking habits of lighter whiskey.  We have smoking habits, which incidentally are today changing the type of cigarettes from regular cigarettes to filters.

Now, I was surprised at the beginning of the conference when Dr. Terry was supposed to have said that there is very little evidence of any

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=299
1668

effect, if any, of filtered cigarettes.  So when we have today 60 percent of the business in the former field compared to three percent ten years ago, I think we need a little more research.

I'm convinced that eventually they will find some element through a filter or through leaf growing or a special type of seed growing that will eliminate the mysterious thing they're looking for.  We want to be the detectives just as much as the Surgeon General and the AMA.  We'll cooperate in every way.

Well, are you saying, then, sir, that there is something toxic about tobacco and which are removable by a filter?

Well, obviously a filter takes out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the industry admits there are any bad elements.  If there are bad elements, through our laboratories, through the Surgeon General, through the AMA, through acts of God and luck, we hope we may find them.  And if they are found, they will be removed.  But at this point, we do not know.

Does any of the research that the tobacco industry has been engaged in refute any part of the findings here or the conclusions as a whole?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=300
1669

Well, without reading the report, I couldn't

answer that to begin with.  I don't think the

tobacco industry as a whole agrees with the

conclusions." BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And that was who again?

A.   Howard Cullman, Philip Morris.

Q.   Was this another example and a beginning step in the continuing efforts to convince the public that cigarettes were safe?

A.   Yeah.  I mean, basically that it hadn't been proven that cigarettes were harmful, that there was, in fact, a scientific controversy, which certainly even by 1964 standards, that had really been settled in the late 1950s.  So it was just a manufactured, you know, controversy.  And they would say if they ever found anything, they would remove it.  So that was reassuring.  If you're an addicted smoker and you keep smoking, maybe you should go to those filters, as he suggested.  And people did.

Q.   We talked about it a little bit.  So why don't we just get into it.  Let's talk about filters for a little bit.

A.   Sure.

Q.   To start with, what effect does the filters

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=301
1670

have on the safety of cigarettes?

A.   There is no real benefit to filters.  They have the effect of allowing a person to take a deeper, harder puff, because you have to pull the smoke not only through the column of tobacco but now through the cellulose acetate that makes up the filter, so that when you pull harder, you tend to draw deeper into your airway.  And so lung cancers tend to occur in different parts of the lungs.  Adenocarcinoma of the lung tends to occur in the peripheral parts of the lung. MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor. MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes. (At sidebar.)

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I think we're now getting into an area that violates the pretrial ruling.  Where we had the motion on cigarette design and his expertise, Your Honor indicated that he would be confined to the Lee County order and that if there was any testimony about a particular design feature making the cigarettes more dangerous, that that would be proffered.  And the Lee County order, which I have a copy of, references -- turning to numbered paragraph 16 of the order, Notably during his testimony,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=302
1671

Dr. Cummings conceded that neither he nor the scientific committee --

THE COURT:  I can't hear you.

MR. CARTER: I'm sorry. If Your Honor would just read paragraph 16 to yourself, that might be easier.

THE COURT: He's not saying � he didn't say it's creating any additional anything.

MR. CARTER:  And that continues through and as we see in the order, the last order deals with this opinion -- excuse me -- the last paragraph of the order deals with the opinion.

MR. CLARK:  He hasn't deviated from that order.  What he testified to is that it creates a different type of cancer.  But he has not said --from what I heard, he didn't say that it increased the risk or that it did anything to make it more harmful.  I believe all he said it was, it's a different type of cancer, where he's speaking at it from an epidemiology perspective where he's saying the location of where the tumor is formed.

THE COURT:  I think he's already testified that it would increase the risk and -- from earlier testimony, the filters did.  Did he not? That's my recollection.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=303
1672

MR. CLARK:  I don't recall him saying that filters increased it.

MS. YATES:  That's as far as he went, Your Honor.  He didn't tie it to a specific design.

MR. CARTER:  And that's why I approached now. What he said so far, we're right up to the line. And so I wanted to approach before the line is crossed because once it's crossed, I think we have a problem.

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  So it sounds like there's no objection.  He just wants to bring it to Your Honor's attention that we don't go any further than what he's got.

MS. YATES:  I do have an objection.  All of a sudden a non-medical doctor is talking about peripheral and location of the lung cancer in the body.  He's not a medical doctor.  He cannot --

MR. CLARK:  He's -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off.

MS. YATES:  He should not be testifying on medical issues.

MR. CLARK:  Dr. Cummings can testify on medical issues.  What he can't do is render a medical causation opinion in this case as to what

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=304
1673

is the cause of Mr. Barbose's lung cancer.  But he's most certainly qualified to talk about the epidemiology, what the causes of cancer are in general in the population.  He already relayed that during his qualifications that he studies the effects of substances and diseases in populations. So he's most certainly qualified to render that opinion.  He is not going to talk about what the cause of John Barbose's lung cancer was.

THE COURT:  Those were one of the six or seven areas that he was qualified as an expert during your preamble or your voir dire of his experience?

MR. CLARK:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

MS. YATES:  It's slightly different, Your Honor.  We're getting into anatomy.  I mean, I understand the population level.  He was going into anatomy and locations of cancers and types of cancers.  And they have another expert coming in.

THE COURT:  I think he's already testified about the filter and bringing it into the lungs. So as long as you're not going any further --

MR. CLARK:  Right.

THE COURT:  � I'll overrule the objection. But thank you for bringing it to my attention.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=305
1674

MR. CARTER:  Okay.  Thank you. MR. CLARK:  Thank you, Judge. (Sidebar concluded.) MR. CLARK:  Overruled, you said? THE COURT:  With that understanding and moving on.

MR. CLARK:  Yes, sir. THE COURT:  Right. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Was the industry during the last half of the 20th century researching different ways of manufacturing the filters? A.   Yes.

Q.   Did they recognize at an earlier point in time -- we've seen that they recognized at an earlier point in time that they could not remove all the carcinogens from the cigarette smoke by the use of filters.

A.   Correct.

Q.   But did they recognize that filters had a marketing sales advantage as well? A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  Let's look at PT2078. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And who is this document written by?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=306
1675

A.   This is Claude Teague.

Q.   Claude Teague.

This is to Mr. Hoover?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we've already --

A.   He's talking about a patent, an invention that he's proposing.

Q.   And to be fair, he's proposing it?

A.   Right.

Q.   Okay.  "Filter tip materials undergoing color change on contact with tobacco smoke.  I have observed and believe it to be generally true that the cigarette smoking public attaches great significance to visual examination of the filter material in filter tip cigarettes after smoking the cigarettes.

"A before-and-after smoking visual comparison is usually made and if the filter tip material after smoking is darkened, the tip is automatically judged to be effective, the degree of darkening being considered as a criterion of filter efficiency.  There is, incidentally, some merit in this type of qualitative test, though it is far from accurate.

"Because the smoking public attaches significance to this visual inspection, the possibility of incorporating chemicals into filter tip materials

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=307
1676

that would darken or otherwise change color on contact with smoke appears attractive.  While the use of such color-change materials would probably have little or no effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip material, the advertising and sales advantages are obvious."

And that was R.J. Reynolds in 1953?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And did the industry promote filters through their advertising?

A.   Sure.  I mean, we saw with the Flintstones Winston cigarettes, the pure white filter -- I mean, cigarette filtering material is translucent or clear. It's made from photographic film, and that's translucent.  And so it's colored already with titanium dioxide, which is a coloring agent to give it its white appearance.  They can color it any color they want it.

MR. CLARK:  PT3 67 8. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is June 1966, Special Report Number 248, Market Potential of a Health Cigarette.  It's stamped "confidential"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   When was the first time you saw this document?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=308
1677

A.   Early 2000.

Q.   Written by M.E. Johnston, Jr.?

A.   Myron Johnston.

Q.   Myron Johnston?

A.   Yep.

Q.   And approved by W.L. Dunn.  Who was --

A.   Dr. William Dunn.  He was the head of the human behavioral research program at Philip Morris, which really began in the 1960s and then grew.  And it was an important part of their research on smoking behavior and utilizing that information for the design of their products.

Q.   And who received this report?

A.   Dr. Wakeham and Dr. Seligman.  So the head of R&D and his assistant basically, Dr. Seligman.

MR. CLARK:  And let's take a look on the next

page.

"Number 10, The Illusion of Filtration is as

Important as the Fact of Filtration."

Now, we're pulling a portion out and the jury

will have the whole document for their review. Go to the next one.  I believe there's one

more after that.

"The market share of health cigarettes

increases rapidly for a brief period during each

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=309
1678

health scare and quickly stabilizes at a new and

higher level of market penetration." BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Did the idea of filtration -- was that instrumental in the rise of cigarettes after the initial scare in the early 1950s?

A.   Yes.  I mean, it went from two percent of the market -- less than two percent actually in the filter type of product before 1953.  By the mid '60s -- this is 1966, this particular document from Philip Morris. You're now close to 70 percent of the market.  So it's a dramatic change now smoking filtered cigarettes.  And you can see that in the marketing.  And they shift their dollars into the marketing of filtered cigarettes and then later into low tar and ultra light cigarettes later.

Q.   What is the effect of the illusion of filtration is as important as the fact of filtration? What effect does that have on the cigarette sales?

A.   Well, what they're say is it's the perception that you think you're doing something better for yourself rather than the fact that filters do anything good for you, because they don't.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT2023. BY MR. CLARK:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=310
1679

Q.   Who is E. Pebbles?  Or Pepples, sorry.

A.   Ernest Pepples is the chief executive counsel of Brown & Williamson, previously had been Addison Yeaman.  This is 1976, and Mr. Yeaman is no longer around and we have Mr. Pepples, who's summarizing how the industry has responded to the smoking and health controversy.  He identifies production of filters as one of the ways that they had done this.

Q.   All right.  "Industry Response to Cigarette Health Controversy.  The tobacco industry has reacted to the challenge of the smoking and health controversy in the following ways:  Produce more filter brands and brands with lower tar delivery; support scientific research to refute unfavorable findings or, at a minimum, to keep the scientific question open; conduct information campaigns against claims by the anti-smoking lobby; voluntarily meet some of the demands of the anti-smoking lobby, such as agreeing to publish the FTC ratings on tar and nicotine in cigarette advertising."

Before I move off of this, please tell the jury the background, the historical background regarding the FTC ratings of tar and nicotine in cigarette advertising.

A.   Sure.  There were a lot of advertising claims

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=311
1680

made about cigarettes and whether they were lower in tar or nicotine and a lot of different methods to get to those numbers that were included in the advertising. In the late 1960s, basically the Federal Trade Commission was given authority to require a standard testing methodology be applied to cigarettes so when you saw the advertising, you could at least say under the standard conditions of smoking, you would get --you know, you could compare one brand to the next.  And so that began to take place -- I think the first report on tar and nicotine was 1968.  The first Federal Trade Commission, they were also authorized by Congress to put out a report on cigarette advertising and the effects of health warnings that began to appear on cigarettes in the mid 1960s.

Q.   Was John Barbose smoking what would be considered a health cigarette? A.   Well, he �

MS. YATES:  Objection �

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Time frame.

THE COURT:  What's the objection?

MR. CARTER:  Time frame.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let's talk about John Barbose's smoking history for a second.

A.   Sure.

Q.   The early brand was what?

A.   His first brand that he was sneaking cigarettes basically was Philip Morris.  And later there's testimony he was smoking Camel and Lucky Strike.  His brother talks about him smoking Marlboro early on in the '60s.  There's a little bit of difference in the testimony in terms of the brand history.  So -- and Winston was another one of those brands that is reported.

So those were -- you know, he went from unfiltered to filtered.  Yeah, those were considered health cigarettes.  You're switching to the pure white filter.

Q.   And what about Marlboro Lights?

A.   Well, that's later.  Marlboro Lights has to be post 1972 just because they didn't exist until 1972. And there's testimony again putting him as switching to Marlboro Lights -- you know, it's hard to know exactly. But certainly by the 1980s, he's smoking Marlboro Lights by my review of the testimony.

Q.   Was John Barbose's migration from cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=313
1682

type that first was unfiltered to the filtered to the lights, was that consistent with the public statements being put out by the cigarette industry?

MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor, vague.

THE COURT:  I don't understand the objection. Do you want to approach the bench?

MS. YATES:  Sure.  It was vague.

(At sidebar.)

THE COURT:  I apologize.

MS. YATES:  I'm sorry.

THE COURT:  I can start looking at this if I don't hear you.

MS. YATES:  The witness himself just said it's confusing.  And counsel is now getting to try and track a certain change.  And we've got maybe Marlboros here and possibly Marlboro Lights here, and I think it's vague and incredibly confusing and misleading for the jury.  Because of the history of the brands, it's confusing in this case.

MR. CLARK:  What he did say was he started with Philip Morris.  That's an unfiltered brand. Moved to Camels and Luckys.  That was unfiltered brands.  Then to Marlboros and Winstons.  And then Marlboro Lights came later.  The Marlboros and the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=314
1683

Winstons and the Marlboro Lights were filtered.

THE COURT:  And that was consistent with the public statements being put out in the cigarette industry?

MR. CLARK:  Right.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.

MR. CARTER:  Could I � in answer to his question, could the witness provide a time period for each of those?

THE COURT:  I think that's what the first objection was, is that you just asked what cigarette was he smoking and you didn't provide a time .

MS. YATES:  Timeframe, yeah.

MR. CLARK:  That's fine.

THE COURT:  I overruled.

MR. CLARK:  Well, you overruled their objection up here.  So I'm going to ask him if he needs me to rephrase the same question.  And I intend to ask him was his pattern of going from the unfiltered brands from the '40s and the '50s into the '60s where he's changing to filters and then to Marlboro Lights later on in the '80s, is that consistent with the messages that were being put out.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=315
1684

THE COURT:  Yes.  But the objection prior was, what cigarettes was he smoking.  And you didn't say what time period.

MR. CLARK:  That I understood.  And I think we cleaned that up.  But I think we've moved on from that now.

MS. YATES:  I think we have, too.  But I don't want counsel leading this witness, because this witness has said it's confusing.  Therein lies the disconnect.

THE COURT:  I think significantly we're there, but just be careful.

MR. CLARK:  I will.  But I also think that that's a matter of cross as well.  If there's some confusion in his testimony there, that's certainly something they can point out.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

(End of sidebar.)

THE COURT:  You may proceed. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Tracking Mr. Barbose's smoking history, you testified that he had Philip Morris, Camel, Lucky Strikes, Marlboro, Winston, Marlboro Lights.

Does that progression and migration from the unfiltered cigarettes from the 1940s and 1950s into the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=316
1685

filtered cigarettes into the '60s and '70s and '80s, does that -- is that consistent with the messages that were being put out by the cigarette industry?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you explain how that is consistent?

A.   The companies were more heavily marketing the brands beginning in the '50s and '60s to switch to basically the filtered brands and then later the low-tar brands like a Marlboro Light, which was a line extension of Marlboro.  And I think there's testimony of family members who talk about him getting Marlboro Lights at a trade show and bringing home the cigarette and showing family members that it, you know, captured more stuff on the filter, just the kind of message that you would get on a pack of Marlboro Lights, because it said "lower in tar and nicotine" communicated right on the pack of the product.

Q.   Was that -- has your research shown that smokers heavily relied on the discoloration of a filter?

A.   Sure, they do.

Q.   And has your research shown how smokers perceive that information?

A.   Sure.  They think the filter is actually taking something out of the product, and they don't

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=317
1686

necessarily recognize that, in fact, when people went from the unfiltered to the filtered cigarettes, the actual data showed that smokers were getting as much or more tar and nicotine than they were getting from the unfiltered cigarettes because they would be taking bigger, deeper puffs on the cigarette.

Q.   And I believe we have that -- something similar.  "The new filter brands" -- this is the same document we were referring to a few minutes ago.  This is PT2023.

"The new filter brands vying for a piece of the growing filter market made extraordinary claims. In most cases, however, the smoker of a filter cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a regular cigarette.  He had abandoned the regular cigarette, however, on the ground of reduced risk to health."

Is that consistent with your research?

A.   It's consistent with my research and it's consistent with my testimony regarding John Barbose. MR. CLARK:  Bear with me just one second,

Your Honor. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   At the time that the -- I'm sorry for that long delay there.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=318
1687

At the time that the filter cigarette market was increasing exponentially during the 1960s, was there research or have you conducted research as to the public awareness of the safety or effectiveness of filters from that era?

A.   Yes.  And it's reflected in the fact people thought filtered cigarettes were safer and they made cigarettes less hazardous to their health.  It's exactly the reason people went to the filtered cigarettes.

Q.   And did the cigarette industry, including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, did they know at that time that they were misleading the public about the effectiveness of filters?

A.   Yes.  They knew cigarette filters were an illusion.

Q.   And John Barbose, would he have been a member of that public?

A.   Yes.

Q.   January 6, 1965.  This is Dr. Wakeham and Dr. Dunn.  Graham's, the tobacco situation.  You put this document in context.  What's taking place here?

A.   Well, we've had the Surgeon General's report

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=319
1688

come out in -- as I mentioned before, in the early part of 1964.  There was a drop in cigarette sales and then a rebound afterwards.  And they're commenting here on the likelihood of future cigarette sales happening and why that would happen.

Q.   "The punch was by no means as lethal as it first appeared.  Maxwell has predicted in the Hutton report 12/64 that sales in 1965 will approach the 1963 record of 508 billion.  I think this is conservative for three reasons:  One, there is a backlog of youth who have refrained from taking up smoking in face of the report.  A substantial number of these can be expected to join with this year's crop of prospects to produce a healthy increase in the number of new smokers."

Is that the position of the industry in the mid 1960s as to the purpose of the youth market?

A.   Yeah.  The youth are replacement smokers for those who quit and die.  You need to -- the business model of the industry is they've got to get youth to replace to maintain their sales over the long term because if you don't get smokers when they're young, your brands and company sales will dry up.

Q.   Moving on.  Did the -- did Congress take some action in later part of the '60s as regarding mandates

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=320
1689

to the Federal Trade Commission?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And just by background, the jury's heard that warnings went on cigarette packages.  And when did those warnings start?

A.   1966.

Q.   And in 1967, the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, did they issue a report to Congress addressing cigarette advertising and the warnings?

A. Yes. They were mandated. That's the first of the reports that came out that I mentioned. They still do reports every year because they're required under law.

MR. CLARK:  PT3870, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is the cover page, Federal Trade Commission report to Congress pursuant to the Federal Cigarette Labelling and Advertising Act, June 30th, 1967.

A.   Correct.

Q.   And so what are they discussing in this part of the report?  What is the Federal Trade Commission discussing in this part of the report?

A. They're discussing the effectiveness of the labels that had gone on about a year earlier on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=321
1690

cigarette packs, the Caution:  Cigarette smoking maybe hazardous to your health, that caution label.  They're basically saying here there is virtually no evidence that the warning statement on cigarette packages has had any significant effect.  If cigarette sales are viewed as an index of effectiveness of the warning statement, one finds that in 1966, more cigarettes were sold than ever before.  Even during January and February of 1966, the first two months that the warning appeared on cigarette packages, cigarette sales were higher than they had been during the same months of the preceding year.

MR. CLARK:  Next page, please, Baron,

page 10. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "The failure of the warning statement on packages to have any discernable effect on cigarette consumption is easily explainable.  The warning statement on the package alone has proved to be ineffective mainly because few people seem to pay attention to it.

The motivations for smoking, physiologically, psychologically and social" -- socio -- can you pronounce that for me?

A.   Sociologically.

pgNbr=322
1691

Q.   There you go -- "are complex and a mere reminder the hazards on the cigarette package cannot compete with the forces that promote cigarette smoking."

Who are the forces that promote cigarette smoking?

A.   R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, the other cigarette manufacturers with their massive amount of advertising, both on television at this time as well as in all other forms of media.

MR. CLARK:  Page 10. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Thus, cigarette sales have continued to increase each year except for 1964" -- what happened in 1964?

A.   That was the Surgeon General's report came out and there was a dip for a couple of months right after the report came out.

Q.   -- "when they declined by 10.7 billion, or about 2 percent.  As noted above, the decline in 1964 is probably due to the publicity that accompanied the publication of the report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health on January 11th, 1964.  In fact, of the 10.7 billion total decline from 1963 to 1964, 10 billion occurred in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=323
1692

months of January and February, and the March sales figures were generally higher in '64 than in 1963.  In 1965, sales continued their upward swing by jumping 16 billion, about 3.1 percent.  And in 1966, they reached a new all-time high of 539 billion units."

And in 1966 was the first year the warnings went on the packages?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "Now, due in part to the cumulative effect of cigarette advertising over the years, advertising that shows cigarette smoking to be an enjoyable and pleasurable activity and ignores the suffering and early death that it causes, many youngsters consider cigarette smoking to be an acceptable and socially desirable activity."

That was the findings of the Federal Trade Commission in 1967?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "Because of the health dangers of the cigarette smoking are not" -- let me read that again.

"They tend to view cigarette smoking as a visible mark of maturity, a passport to adulthood. Because the health dangers of cigarette smoking are not brought home to them in an effective and meaningful way, many teenagers take up the smoking habit.  Current

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=324
1693

cigarette advertising constitutes a strong force in our society to persuade teenagers to overcome their initial distaste for cigarettes."

I'm going to let you read, but tell us, what are they looking at here?

A.   Now they're looking at their analysis of expenditures on advertising.  And they point out, "Expenditures on cigarette advertising and promotions increased each year during the period between 1963 and '66, reaching nearly $3 million in 1966.  More of this money was spent on television than on other media -- on all other media combined."

So they were heavily spending on advertising on television.

"And throughout the period, 1963 to '66, approximately three-fourths of total cigarette advertising and promotional expenditures were on the filter type cigarettes," which I have explained before that they put the money behind the filtered cigarette ads .

Q.   How much effort did the cigarette industry, including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, put in promoting these filter-tipped cigarettes that they knew were misleading to the public?

A.   They were among the most -- they were --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=325
1694

Reynolds was the largest cigarette company at this point.  Winston and Salem were very popular cigarettes. So they were spending the most money on advertising. And Philip Morris, with its introduction of Marlboro cigarettes, was also spending a large amount of money on their advertising.  They introduced the Marlboro country campaign with the cowboy beginning in 1963.

Q.   Before you read this -- this is getting into a new area -- was that consistent with John Barbose going from non-filters to filters?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What are they looking at now?

A.   This is looking at the composition of the audience.  The FTC was particularly concerned about the exposure that young people were getting to advertising on television.  At this time, over 80 television shows were sponsored, only three networks.  So a lot of shows were sponsored by cigarette makers.

And so they did an analysis for one week in January where they estimated the viewership and then they broke it down as to who was watching those shows. So, you know, what did the cigarette manufacturers receive for their substantial advertising expenditures and particularly for that two-thirds portion spent on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

it was like wallpaper.  You couldn't really escape it. And that's essentially the conclusion of the FTC.

MR. CLARK:  Page 16, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all Americans who can either read or understand the spoken word.  So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to avoid cigarette advertising.  Many of the daytime and evening television programs are sponsored by cigarette manufacturers, and numerous magazines and newspapers read by the whole family contained cigarette advertising.  As stated above, youth is also exposed to cigarette advertising.

During the week of January 11th, 1967, the aforementioned networks sponsored -- the aforementioned 60 network programs sponsored in whole or in part by cigarette products played before 322.7 million viewers who were under 21 years of age.  These included 151.1 million viewers aged two to 12 and 141 million viewers aged 13 to 17."

Is this consistent with your opinion that cigarette advertising was like wallpaper everywhere?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, bolstering.

MR. CLARK:  Let me rephrase that, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.  Rephrase it.  Thank you. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Based on your research, your education, your training, your review of internal documents, your review of reports by the federal government, do you have an opinion as to whether or not John Barbose was exposed to cigarette advertising in the period of the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s?

A.   It would be virtually impossible for him not to have exposure.  And certainly by the time he is smoking cigarettes -- they just don't drop out of the sky.  You go to a store, you've got all kinds of advertising.  You pick up a product, that's advertising.  So of course he was exposed to advertising.  Plus the massive amount of advertising that was happening in the general environment, every one of those, for somebody who's an addicted smoker, is a stimulus.  They'll light up a cigarette.  It normalizes smoking.  And it's acute, so stimulus response.  And that's what advertising of cigarettes --the massive amounts has that effect, which helps sell more cigarettes.

Q.   I think the jury was told this before.  Every time John Barbose grabbed a pack of cigarettes after

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=329
1698

1966, he also bought a warning.  Was he also exposed to cigarette advertising every time he went for that pack of cigarettes?

A.   Yes, he was.  And the information contained on that pack.

Q.   As well as information not contained on that packet?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Things that are not used in cigarette advertising.  "There is no indication in any advertisement that after a person smokes cigarettes regularly for a while, smoking is no longer a matter of choice for him but becomes a matter of need.

After the Surgeon General's report was published, cigarette clinics, some similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, were formed throughout the country to help people stop smoking.  Yet most of them have now been dissolved because of the poor results. Advertisements for cigarettes never show this side of smoking.  They never show an habituated cigarette smoker with a hacking cough groping for a cigarette upon waking in the morning.  They never suggest the tension felt by a chain smoker when he runs out of cigarettes.  In terms of public understanding of the health hazards, knowledge of this aspect of smoking is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=330
1699

essential.  Only when one realizes that cigarette smoking cannot automatically be stopped and started at will can he fully understand how dangerous it is even to start.  In making a decision on whether to start smoking, youngsters especially have a right to know that once they start, they may never be able to stop. A viewer of cigarette commercials and advertisements would never hear of this aspect of smoking." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   "Cigarette smoking is without question the greatest single public health problem this nation has ever faced.  The cost to society of cigarette smoking in human terms is staggering."

In your experience as a smoking cessation expert, what has been the effect of cigarette advertising on the public?

A.   Well, it helped sustain smoking, made it appear to be a normal, acceptable activity without communicating accurately the dangers that are involved That was pretty much what cigarette advertising did. It stimulated smokers to keep smoking, often provided incentives to smoke more through incentive programs where you'd get gifts, you sent in your miles or UPC codes or whatever.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=331

So cigarette advertising has contributed to the massive deaths that we see.  One out of two people die if they're long-term smokers as a result of smoking, 20 million American deaths since 1964, and every one of those deaths is perfectly preventable.

MR. CLARK:  PT2380, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Are you familiar with this document?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Smoker Psychology Research by Dr. H. Wakeham, Dr. Helmut Wakeham?

A.   Correct, to board of directors of Philip Morris.

Q.   And what is he doing -- what is he reporting to the board of directors in this report?

A.   He's talking about the program of research that Dr. William Dunn had set up at Philip Morris, the human smoking behavior research.  He's talking about what that research program at Philip Morris was about and what it was intended to accomplish.  And he points out here their objectives, "To determine early in research and development the consumer acceptability of a product idea before we expend hundreds of thousands of dollars developing it, and to learn more about the psychology of smoking hopefully to discover ways to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=332
1701

exploit the benefits of smoking to an advantage and profitability of our major company business."

Q.   Based on your review of internal documents, did Philip Morris and the other cigarette companies, including R.J. Reynolds, do research in order to exploit the benefits of smoking to the advantage and profitability of their business?

A.   Yes.  That was their goal was to obviously maximize their profits, not put the public's health above all other considerations of their business they had told the American public in 1953.  It was all about profits, selling more cigarettes.  And here they're basically focused on the question of why people smoke.

Q.   That's what I was about to ask you.  Does he discuss why people smoke in what he says?

A.   Yeah.  He breaks it down into two parts.  He said you have to understand why people start smoking and why they persist or continuing in smoking.  And he says, "There's general agreement on the answer to the first part.  The 16- to 20-year-old begins smoking for psychosocial reasons.  The act of smoking is symbolic. It signifies adulthood.  He smokes to enhance his image in the eyes of his peers.  But the psychological-- or psychosocial motive is not enough to explain continued smoking.  Some other motive force takes over to make

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=333
1702

smoking rewarding in its own right.  Long after adolescent preoccupation with self image has subsided, the cigarette will even preempt food in times of scarcity on the smoker's priority list.  Witness the experience many people had at the end of War World II when one would buy wine, women, and a song with a cigarette.  The question is, why?"

And he goes on to answer that question a few pages later.

Q.   That's where we're headed to.  If you'll read that highlighted portion.

A.   "Since we are of the conviction in view of the foregoing that the ultimate explanation for the perpetuated cigarette habit resides in the pharmacologic effect of smoke upon the body of the smoker, the effect being most rewarding to the individual under stress."

Q.   What has your research shown is the -- I'm sorry.

What has your research shown that what --what substance in cigarette smoke is the pharmacological effect?

A.   He talks about it.  It's nicotine.  And so nicotine is the key ingredient, and the product is engineered to maintain threshold level -- don't go

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=334
1703

below the threshold level of nicotine -- to keep people smoking, make it hard for them to quit.

Q.   Did every brand of cigarettes purchased and smoked by John Barbose have sufficient amounts of nicotine to create and sustain addiction?

A.   Yes.  They were engineered that way.

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, this may be a good time for a break.

THE COURT:  Good idea.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break until 2:45.  I think it's a good time.  I see a couple of yawns over there.  And if I see any more, I'm going to turn the thermostat down about ten degrees.

(Recess taken from 2:26 p.m. to.

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, they have one document to address.

MR. CARTER:  Plaintiff's Exhibit 1913.

May I approach?

THE COURT:  You may approach.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, our objections here are on 403.  This is a document dealing with an orientation session that the legal department of R.J. Reynolds provided to Dr. DiMarco.  And it goes through various -- this is the law department

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=335
1704

talking within the law department about what the interview revealed and follow-up questions and basically how the legal department was going to respond to this.  There's --

THE COURT:  From Wayne Shurat � Jurat �

MR. CARTER:  Juchatz.

THE COURT:  Who is that?  Is he the attorney?

MR. CARTER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I don't know that I've heard that name yet.

MR. BIGGER:  I don't think he's � he's not a higher level -- he's not with general counsel or anything.  I think Witt was either general counsel or associate.

THE COURT:  And who was WWJ?

MR. BIGGER:  Where do you see that?

THE COURT:  Same person.  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  That's the initials, yes.

THE COURT:  I got you.

MR. CARTER:  So this is a document that's been excluded in a number of cases.  I think it's -- and with the 403, the unfair prejudice, to get into this topic.  There's obviously a number of activities that Dr. DiMarco then, subsequent to this, in fact, undertook.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=336
1705

So I think to -- there's other documents, if plaintiff wants to tell this story or a version of it, they can, but I think this is one where it leads to an unnecessary back and forth on something.  It's what makes the prejudice unfair, and that's why, I think, it's been excluded in a number of previous cases.

THE COURT:  So it's from an attorney and it's just his memoranda, but it's not just to a file on --

MR. CARTER:  It's to another gentleman in the legal department.

MR. BIGGER:  The GM?  Witt was the GC, wasn't he?  I thought, or at least -- Samuel Witt was high.  If he's not the GC, he's higher up.  He's essentially on the committee of counsel, I think, correct?

MR. CARTER:  Correct.  Chief general counsel, at the time.

MR. BIGGER:  Member of the accepted committee of counsel for CTR.

If you look at the first paragraph of that letter, "as requested," so requested by Witt.  He was on the committee of counsel at CTR.  He was the chief general counsel of R.J. Reynolds.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=337
1706

"The following is a summary of statements made by Dr. DiMarco which provide insight into his position on the smoking and health controversy as well as his perceptions of lawyers and their involvement in the workings of the research and development department."

So it's the context in which this is raised. And it's, again, continuing that controversy. Essentially, Dr. DiMarco was a little disgruntled.

If you look down at No. 1 there, during his law department orientation, he said that he thinks it's essential for R&D to work on the development of a less mutagenic cigarette, which is a less cancerous cigarette.  He believes that this is the prudent, responsible thing to do, but he has been told by the lawyers -- that Jacob was another individual that was involved in CTR and committee counsel -- that he can't do this work.  And then that's one of the cause we'll, obviously, use with this document.

The next one is the one that says, "I explained," the next paragraph down.

"I explained our legal concerns about the admission implicit in those words "less mutagenic or safer" that our existing products are mutagenic

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=338
1707

or unsafe.  He seemed to understand our concern, but refused to accept is as a rationale for not doing what he felt we had an obligation to do as a responsible manufacturer."

So this is while they were denying they were cancer causing and they were trying to continue that -- propagate that concealment.  This is what was going on inside the company, even when there was an employee, a scientist, who was concerned with what was going on with lawyers from the CTR, lawyers within the company, directing research and research and development.

And then the second page is where the next thing is, Your Honor.  There's just three cause. The two, I've already shown you.  The third one is on the second page in the -- basically in the middle where it's underlined.

THE COURT:  "He also said"?

MR. BIGGER:  "He also said, 'Although I can't recall his exact words, that our medical scientific witnesses will say whatever we want them to say, clearly implying, if not stating, that they lack credibility and integrity."

This ties into that Ernie Pebbles document, meeting of the CTR we had just before we broke at

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=339
1708

lunch.  Again, this is the work of the committee of counsel on special projects developing and grooming witnesses to testify to Congress, to testify in other locations.  That's what he's referring to there with regard to -- they're saying, Hey, we have people who say cancer, smoking doesn't cause cigarettes (sic), and he was talking about those individuals saying, Well, you've groomed them to say whatever you want them to say.

THE COURT: Was this admitted into evidence in the Engle case?

MR. CARTER:  I don't know, off the top of my head.

MR. BIGGER: I don't know the answer. It's been admitted in a lot of cases. I'm sure there are cases where Mr. Carter knows it's been denied.

My recollection is -- and obviously consistent with Your Honor's prior rulings, I think allowing this in would be consistent with those.  I think in other situations it's been perhaps excluded.  I don't know.

MR. CARTER:  This document does continues on on page 3 and 4.  It talks about whether the FDA should regulate --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1709

MR. BIGGER:  We're not using those.

MR. CARTER:  But I don't know � if my objection is overruled, I don't know if they're going to move in the entire document.

MR. BIGGER:  You want us just to do two pages, Page 1 and 2?

THE COURT:  I know he's objecting to it all, but �

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.  I mean, if that's a power play, I can just do page 1 and 2 is fine.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection as to pages 1 and 2, but I'll sustain the objections as to page 3 and 4.

Q.   If you will please, Dr. Cummings, please identify what you're looking at here.  If you need a pointer, you have a laser pointer, if that helps.

A.   Sure.  It's easy, because I think we've already explained to the jury that the Marlboro full-flavor, the red pack, has got the cork color tipping paper.  And you can see the Marlboro Light version over here, which is the white tipping paper.

Dissected out, the paper -- so you're seeing the paper that is the roll of -- it goes around the roll of tobacco.  Oftentimes that's perforated as well. Different amounts of perforation affect the delivery that you get on a standard smoking machine.

The filter tip, you can see a slight difference.  The Marlboro Light is a little bit longer in terms of the filter versus the Marlboro regular. But you see the white cellulose acetate.  There are about 12,000 fibers bundled together in a filter.  They make them long cellulose acetate tow and they chop them in a high speed manner.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=343
1712

The fibers would, of course, fall apart, so they spray a little glue -- Plasticizer, they call it, on the filter tip to hold the fibers together, but not enough to actually prevent things coming through the filter.  And that's one of the reasons you get filter fiber fallout.  When you talk about the fallout, you're getting little bits of the cellulose acetate that come into your mouth.  You can't see these, so these particles of fibers are so small, they're microscopic. You can only really see them under a microscope.

And we have dissected them out of the lungs of patients.  And you only see the fibers in the lungs of people who smoke filtered cigarettes, not non-filtered smokers, because they do get lodged in the lung and the tar gets coated -- or the fibers get coated with the tar, so it provides concentrated dosing of the carcinogens in the lung.

Q.   Now, you said that --

MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor, move to

strike.  The question was "Sometimes it's helpful

to see them" -- sorry, "Would you please identify

what you're looking at here?"

So I move to strike everything after "a

Marlboro and Marlboro Light cigarette and the

filter."  Nothing to do with lungs.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Let's try to be responsive to the questions.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Thank you, sir. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, you've mentioned in the answer that the fibers, you can't really see them.  Are there other features of the Marlboro and the Marlboro Light that are not really visible to the naked eye in this fashion?

A.   Sure.  There are little ventilation holes, filter vents as they call them, that are lasered in. The tipping paper, which is the paper that goes around the filter, there are typically two bands in a Marlboro Light.  And in a Marlboro regular, when the regulars first came out, they didn't have the vent holes, but over time, they've added the vent holes to the Marlboro Reds.  So you can see they have the single band.

So let me just point out where they are.  You can see the filter -- you have to really have light underneath it.  You can't see these with the naked eye.

Q.   I was going to ask you that.  Is the smoker that's smoking these, can he see those when he's smoking a cigarette?

A.   No.  And we've done studies to ask smokers

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=345
1714

whether they're aware whether their cigarettes are vented or not.

Q.   What's the results of that study?

A.   Most smokers have no idea about filter vents and the effects of filter vents.

Q.   What are the effects of filter vents?

A.   Well, there are a couple.  One, by putting the ventilation in, it cools the smoke, so allows you to take a bigger, deeper puff of this smoke.  That has effects on inhalation, obviously.

Secondly, the filter vents, because you mix oxygen as the hot smoke and tars condensating at the end, you get more mutagenic tars.  So if you actually test the tar from filter-vented cigarettes, they score higher on assays that we -- you know, these tests that we do to look at whether they cause DNA damage to cells.

So the more filter venting you have in a cigarette, the greater the mutagenicity of the smoke. And that's -- mutagenicity is bad, so it's causing DNA damage.

Q.   Let's take a look at the Marlboro Light vent holes.

A.   So you can see the two vents right there.  So this is one of the ways that they give you on a machine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=346
1715

lower levels of tar and nicotine, which is certainly true on a machine that smokes at a standard, you know, puff volume and length and so on.

But smokers will simply take deeper puffs smoking for nicotine, so they're going to take longer puffs, deeper puffs.  Sometimes they cover up the vent holes with their lips or with their fingers, so sort of crimp them.

Q.   What is that phenomenon commonly referred to as?

A.   Compensation.

Q.   Can you explain to the jury a little bit more about compensation in terms of whether or not the smoker understands compensation and whether they're aware of it?

A.   Well, I can explain it, certainly.

Compensation is basically whether you're getting biologically how much of the smoke and the tar and the nicotine you're actually getting in your system.  And when you look at smokers of different brands of cigarettes, they tend to compensate when they go down, like, from an unfiltered to a filter or to --from the filter to the low-yield cigarettes to maintain their nicotine levels.  So they can do various -- they can smoke more cigarettes, that's the simple way of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=347
1716

doing it.  Generally, smokers know when they're smoking more .

But most compensation is unknown to the smoker because they're just taking slightly deeper puffs on the cigarette, so you look at puff volume.  Or the interval between puffs is slightly different.  And then when you measure the nicotine and tar in the smoker, there are various measures of these things. You can measure biologically and various fluids.  You find there's no difference in the exposures except, actually, the tar from the filter-vented cigarettes is more dangerous because of the mutagenicity.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes. (At sidebar.)

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I believe that last comment at the end of the answer violates the pretrial order.  I think it's inconsistent with the Lee County Daubert hearing and the restrictions that were put on his testimony.  I would move to strike it and I'd request a curative instruction consistent with the Lee County order that Dr. Cummings does not have the expertise or the scientific consensus establishing that testimony and the jury needs to disregard the last

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=348
1717

portion of the answer.

THE COURT:  He didn't get into the medical testimony, he was talking about the venting.

MR. CARTER:  And the Lee County order indicates that he was -- there's no scientific consensus that any aspect of cigarette design, other than nicotine, makes it more dangerous.

And if we look at the Lee County order --

MS. YATES:  It's an opinion out of the 6th, I believe.

MR. CARTER:  If you look at the lead-in under "Order and Adjudged," it says, "Dr. Cummings cannot opine or otherwise articulate that any specific design features of a cigarette, other than nicotine, have caused nicotine addiction or risks associated with cigarettes, nor may he opine on any one design aspect of a cigarette led to an increase in the addiction or health problems of any one plaintiff."

Then it goes on and explains how there isn't a consensus.  And it says, "Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the requisite reliability on any of the studies, scientific consensus, and other evidence to demonstrate that any one particular aspect of a cigarette design, other than nicotine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=349
1718

itself leads to an increase in addiction. And that last comment at the end of his thing just said it makes it more dangerous.

And so I believe it's in direct violation of Your Honor's pretrial ruling and representations made at the hearing that he would be confined to the Lee County order.

MR. CLARK:  I'll allow him to read that, but I was going to comment on that.

THE COURT:  The transcript is not right.  I believe what Dr. Cummings said was that the tar is more mutagenic.  He didn't say anything about a design feature of cigarettes being more dangerous or more hazardous.

MR. CARTER:  We're in the context, Your Honor.

MR. VAKA:  He's restricted from saying this.

MR. CARTER:  In the context, Your Honor. We're looking at an ELMO -- a picture of the filter is on the screen, and we've been talking about that design aspect and explaining what it is.  So I think it's squarely within Lee County.

MR. CLARK: We had gotten off of the filter for a second.  We were talking about compensation. And he was describing compensation and those

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=350
1719

aspects of it, but he didn't reference any design feature being more harmful to any particular plaintiff.  And that's what paragraph 16 of the order says.  He can't say that any one particular design feature, other than nicotine, makes a cigarette more addictive or more harmful to a smoker.

MR. CARTER:  I think that's � the entire concept of compensation that's being discussed, the fund of -- actual predicate for that is the filter.  And he said that's what compensation is, is that when there's the filter, they try to get -- obtain the same amount of nicotine and so they do X, Y, and Z.  So there's no such thing as compensation making sense, separate and apart from the design feature.

THE COURT:  Rather than throwing things at me from Lee County that we talked about two weeks ago -- you know, am I able to cite and recite all of this order as indicated?  No.  You've thrown a ten-page document at me.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, I share your frustration, but the witness should have been instructed on this order.

And, two, his talking about the filter and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=351
1720

the holes and the compensation that leads to more tar, leading to more mutagenic is in direct contravention to the order.  And the witness should know the order, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  And this was on the Daubert hearing in Lee County?

MS. YATES:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  We didn't have any Daubert hearings on Dr. Cummings.  I mean, we went through 18 volumes of notebooks, okay?

MR. CARTER:  We did.

THE COURT:  So am I supposed to know what now you're talking about?

MR. CARTER:  With all due respect, Your Honor, I agree.  I don't think this is necessarily Your Honor's problem.

The reason we didn't have a Daubert hearing and the reason that motion was resolved, plaintiff's counsel said, Judge, this Daubert hearing argument already was conducted in Lee County.  It was multiple days.  He's not going to go beyond the order.

And Your Honor's ruling on the record at the pretrial hearing was explicit that he would be confined to the six opinions in the Lee County

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=352
1721

order for those bases.  And I think Mr. Geise, at the hearing, asked that the witness be instructed. And you made a remark that with respect to all of your rulings, you presumed that all the witnesses were to be instructed.

MR. CLARK:  Number one, Judge, it's issues of difference of opinion as to whether he's gone beyond the Lee County order.  I don't believe he has .

But second of all, I take issue with the assumption that I -- that that's going to be an attack on plaintiff's counsel that he's not been instructed on Your Honor's rulings.  So I don't begin to want to sit here and stand by and be silent thinking that I didn't instruct this witness on Your Honor's rulings.  He's been instructed.

The testimony he just gave was related to tar being hazardous.  He didn't say a design feature. We can go through the last day and a half of Dr. Cummings' testimony and use that as a predicate for something.  If you want to take counsel's suggestion that the filters was what prompted this initial discussion to begin with.

We were talking about compensation.  We were

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=353
1722

talking about what is compensation.  And he's describing that process.  He's not talking about a specific design feature.

THE COURT:  I just don't see what he just said was anything different than what he's already testified to three or four times about the venting and the filters.

MS. YATES:  He got into a specific, Your Honor, due to the venting, due to the filters, compensation occurs.  Because of compensation, they get more tar.  This is more dangerous tar that makes a greater risk, so it's a more dangerous feature.

It's all going in through the filter design feature, and this crosses the line.

THE COURT:  The Court is going to overrule the objection with the understanding that he's not going to go any further than he has already gone.

MR. CLARK: I understand.

THE COURT:  That he has violated this order at this point.  But anything further, the Court will readdress.

MR. CLARK:  Understand.

MS. YATES:  Thank you.

(Sidebar concluded.) MR. CLARK:  May I continue? THE COURT:  You may continue.  Thank you,

Counsel. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let me get back to where we were.  We were talking about compensation.  And one of the things you testified in your answer there was the smoker doesn't normally recognize that he or she is compensating.

If the smoker doesn't recognize he or she is compensating, is the family able to recognize the smoker's compensating?

A.   No, of course not.

Q.   Now, turning back to what we have displayed up here for the jury, let's turn, if you will, to the tobacco that's actually contained inside.  And I believe you have a Marlboro cigarette right there.  And if you would, let' s talk a little bit about the actual tobacco inside the cigarette.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Can you explain -- I believe you touched on it some yesterday, but please explain the blend and --I don't know if we can show some of the tobacco on the screen.

Explain what the blend is and what is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=355
1724

contained inside the rod of the cigarette.

A.   Sure.  Well, there's the three main blends. I described them before; burley and Bright tobacco, as well as the Turkish tobacco.  They are --

Q.   Stop for just one second.

MR. CLARK:  May I approach the witness? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Please continue, Dr. Cummings.  I'm sorry.

A.   I said cigarettes were made in high-speed equipment, you know, and the tobacco is chopped up. There's also the manmade tobacco.  So in a Marlboro, a percentage of the tobacco is this reconstituted or manmade tobacco which is made from the stems and the stalks and other tobacco that's recycled and so on; that they do an extraction process that takes the water-soluble chemicals out of the tobacco, which includes nicotine.  And then they reapply it in a uniform dose.

And if you're carefully trained, you can actually discern different types of tobacco under a microscope.  There's also some other simpler ways to do it like taking the tobacco, and you can actually separate the real tobacco from the manmade tobacco.  If you just drop it in water and let it sit there, the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=356
1725

manmade --

Q.   I have a bottle for you.  Would you mind doing that?

A.   Sure, be happy to.

-- the manmade tobacco will float to the bottom.  Takes about five minutes.  We'll see it separate.  And we'll see some of the chemical agents that have been applied to the tobacco, and the reconstituted tobacco change the color of the water. So you can see here it's nice and clear and this will turn a little orange in color, reddish-orange color, which are those chemicals, including the nicotine that's been applied and coming off.

So just, hopefully, won't make too much of a mess, but I'll try to get it into the top of the bottle.

Q.   I'm going to bring you a piece of paper, Dr. Cummings.

A.   That's all right.  I have my notes here.  I can do it on top of that.  I don't want to have too much of a mess for the Court to clean up.

So the real -- the manmade tobacco is a little denser because it's manmade.  And if you actually put pieces of paper into a glass of water, eventually the pieces of paper will float to the bottom

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=357
1726

of the glass, the same idea.

So I'll just fill this up.  You can do it --you know, if you have a spinning machine, it speeds the process up.  But you can begin to see the tobacco separate and -- it will probably be hard for you to see -- I don't know if you'll pass this around eventually, but the paper tobacco will eventually sink to the bottom.  And you can compare different blends, different brands of cigarettes, and how much of the manmade tobacco you have.

And, generally, cigarettes go from the full-flavor to the lower-yield products, like a Marlboro Light or an Ultra Light, you tend to see more manmade tobacco in the product.

Q.   Let me stop you right there for a second. A.   Sure.

MR. CLARK:  With the Court's permission, we would like to allow these to circulate through the jury and let them see a little bit closer up.

THE COURT:  No objection?

MR. CARTER:  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And by "these," I mean the cigarettes that we created the slides with.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=358
1727

While the jury is looking at that, Dr. Cummings, can you identify some of the different types of tobacco or what we can see in the -- on the ELMO?

A.   Well, I mean, again, it's the three main blends, plus the reconstituted tobacco, that's used in Marlboro cigarettes.  So that's what you're seeing there.  And, you know, there's different colors. Burley tends to be a little darker color than the lighter Bright tobacco, obviously.

The name -- you remember Bright tobacco is flue-cured.  That's the heat curing; whereas, Burley tends to be air-cured in barns where they hang the tobacco up in the barns to do the curing.  And the Oriental tobacco, which is a smaller component of the tobacco in the product, will be sun-cured, partially.

Q.   The -- and I'm trying to describe as best I can for the record, but some of the tobacco looks more ribbon shaped?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that tobacco or is that the recon tobacco?

A. It's hard to tell. You need to actually just do the float test. You can look at the density of the product because it depends how they make the recon and what they put into the recon to make the manmade.  And

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=359
1728

there are all kinds of different formulas for doing that, as well as additives that are added to the reconstituted product as well.  So you'd have to -- I couldn't tell just by looking on the ELMO there.

Q.   Now, the recon process, I know you touched on it a little bit yesterday.  Can you describe kind of the recon process from beginning to end?

A.   Sure.  I mean, they take stems and the stalks, they recycle tobacco that's unsold.  Sometimes they'll take regular tobacco leaf.  They can grind it up.  They run it through, you know, basically, chemical paths which are an extraction method that will pull the color out.  They call it the rich brown liquor that they pull out of the product.  That's the liquid that they have.

Q.   Does that liquid contain nicotine?

A.   Yeah.  Well, nicotine is water soluble, so that's one of the things that comes out of the tobacco and -- so with reconstituted material, what you're left with is a white slurry.  And they put that out on giant drying trays and, you know, they can make it as thick or as thin as they want.  They spray pectin, for the most part, on it to hold it together like in jellies and so on.  This pectin is used, and that binds it together.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=360
1729

And then depending on their formulas, they'll reapply the nicotine and coloring agents, because it's white when they've done the extraction.  So this is one of the reasons that this is turning color there, is some of those coloring agents are coming off the recon. So they have to put it back in.  So the smoker would be surprised if they saw white.  In fact, if you get a cheaper type of cigarette, you'll find white flakes in it because the quality control is a little less for those brands.

And so then they will, you know, chop the recon up, add it to their blend.  They're precisely controlling the dose of nicotine because you can put it in a uniform way over that sheet, unlike normal tobacco leaves which will vary quite a bit from one part of the leaf to the next in terms of the nicotine you get.

So this is a control mechanism for nicotine delivery.  It's also economical to use all aspects of the plant when you're, you know, manufacturing the cigarettes.  It only costs about two or to three pennies to make a cigarette.

Q.   How does nicotine get into --

MS. YATES:  Your Honor � I apologize, Counsel.

Your Honor, I move to strike as

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=361
1730

non-responsive.  The question was, Does that

liquid contain nicotine?

THE COURT:  That will be sustained and that

response shall be stricken. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, during the reconstituted process, please describe for the jury how the nicotine is removed and the efforts the industry does to apply it uniformly.

A.   They take the -- they use chemicals to extract the nicotine and coloring agents, the water soluble agents.  And that's the rich brown liquor.  And then they reapply the material and spray it on the sheet that they've created.

Q.   How did the nicotine get in tobacco to begin with?

A.   Well, nicotine is natural in tobacco plants. As I said, some species of tobacco plants have higher or lower levels of nicotine.  And so one of the ways they control nicotine delivery is through cross hybridization, genetic manipulation.  That's cross-breeding of tobacco plants.  So you can cross-breed to get higher or lower yields of nicotine depending on what you're looking for.  And that's another methodology that's been used by the companies

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=362
1731

to control the nicotine delivery.

Q.   Let's talk for just a minute about some of the additives and ingredients the cigarette companies do to cigarettes � or add to cigarettes.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Can you list and describe what some of those additives and ingredients are?

A.   Well, you have propylene glycol, glycerin. These are additives that help keep the tobacco moist, so it has a little longer shelf life.  They call those humectants.  But they also have important effects on the character of the smoke because they make the irritation that you get -- nicotine is actually an irritant.  Other smoke particles cause irritation in the throat.  So those chemical additives actually help minimize the irritation of cigarette smoke, making it easier to inhale.  There are a variety of chemicals --diammonium phosphate, urea, lots of different sugars that are put in the product that have effects on the smoke character.  pH is very important.  Tobacco smoke without additives tends to be slightly acidic, so you have to have the right pH to facilitate inhalation. And if you go too high on pH, it's impossible to inhale it, like a cigar.

I think it said, you know, above eight on a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=363
1732

pH scale, which goes from zero to 14.  So cigarette smoke tends to be around five to six.  And by some of these additives, like diammonium phosphate and urea, they affect the pH by sort of increasing it slightly. And that has impact effects on both inhalation, making it less harsh.  It also changes the form of nicotine from an on-bound to free-form nicotine, so sort of like freebasing.

Q.   Let me ask you this question.  Just in case, can you explain kind of the pH scale and what that is?

A.   Sure.  You know, pH goes from zero to 14; water, saliva, seven, in the middle.  You know, so you go to baking soda on one end, highly alkaline.  And then you have battery acid and so on, things that are more acidic at the other end of the scale.

And I said, you know, cigarette smoke without additives tends to be in the low fives on the pH scale. And most of the nicotine in that form is in a bound form.  But just moving it up slightly into slightly above six on a pH scale changes the form, and you get a higher proportion of unbound or free nicotine, which gives you more impact as it facilitates rapid absorption of nicotine.  So that has a positive effect if you're smoking for nicotine.

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, may I approach the

witness?

THE COURT:  You may.

MR. CLARK:  I want to get this bottle.  And with the Court's permission, I'd like to --

THE WITNESS:  Make sure the lid's on there. MR. CLARK:  -- make sure the lid's on tight. I'd like to let the jury get a little closer look at this as well.

THE COURT:  Any objection? MR. CARTER:  No, Your Honor. MS. YATES:  No. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   As you testified earlier, some of the tobacco is floating.  And that is what again?

A.   Well, that will be the -- natural tobacco tends to hang out on the surface of the water, and the manmade reconstituted tobacco tends to go to the bottom.

Q.   We'll give the jury just a minute to look and then I'll move on.

Have people used that brown substance if they put it in a spray bottle, have they used it for different applications � A.   Yeah. Q.   � outside cigarette �

1734

A.   Sure.

Q.   What would it be good for?

A.   It's a great insecticide.  Nicotine is a poison and it has effects on the central nervous system.  And pure nicotine is a lethal poison.  So if you -- it used to be used in insecticides very frequently in this country until the late '80s.  I think the Department of Agriculture banned it in the United States because it was too dangerous to be spraying around.

Q.   Well, we'll make sure nobody drinks that while we're here.

A.   I don't think you'll have to worry.

Q.   All right.  Dr. Cummings, I want to talk just briefly about Marlboro Lights specifically for just a minute if that's okay with you, sir.

A.   Okay.

MR. CLARK:  Let's put up PT1075, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And this is Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   September 17, 1975.  And what is this document about, sir?

A.   Well, this is one of the internal documents from Philip Morris.  And Barbara Goodman, who was in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=366
1735

their R&D department, is talking about data that they had collected on smokers.  They took some regular Marlboro smokers and also smokers of Marlboro Lights, and they switched them to see what effect there would be on smoker compensation.  And they were measuring the effects of compensation and things like puff counts and so on and using fairly sophisticated computer devices to measure how people are actually smoking the cigarette.

And they draw some conclusions from -- this is a relatively small study, but there are other studies within Philip Morris that talk about smoker compensation -- in fact, many.

Q.   Could I get you to read that highlighted portion, please?

A.   Yeah.  "The smoker profile data reported earlier indicated that the Marlboro Light cigarettes were not smoked like regular Marlboros.  There were differences in the size and frequency of the puffs, with larger volumes taken on Marlboro Lights by both regular Marlboro smokers and Marlboro Light smokers."

Q.   And is that the phenomenon of compensation that you were talking about earlier?

A.   Yes.

Q.   This is Ms. Goodman's conclusions?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=367
1736

A.   Yes.  "Marlboro Lights caused the smokers to take larger puffs on the cigarette than the Marlboro 85s.  The larger puffs, in turn, increase the delivery of essentially the Marlboro Lights proportion -- Lights proportionally.  In effect, the Marlboro 85 smokers in this study did not achieve any reduction in smoke intake" -- tar and nicotine -- "by smoking a cigarette Marlboro Lights, normally considered low in delivery. Conversely, the Marlboro Lights smokers did not increase their smoke intake when they changed to the regular delivery cigarette."

So, you know, you're showing compensation going both ways.

MR. CLARK:  All right.  Let's go to PT4819, please.

"Reactions to a proposed new 85-millimeter Benson & Hedges among current Benson & Hedges smokers in Dallas prepared for Wells, Rich, Green, Incorporated, for Philip Morris." Let's go to page 10.

"Attitudes Towards Benson & Hedges.  Those who are currently smoking lights do so because they are better for you than full-flavor cigarettes.  Although some experienced that they actually smoked more lights, they perceive that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=368
1737

they are cutting down and it is an alternative to

quitting, which most cannot accomplish." BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Based on your education, training, research, review of internal documents, do you have an opinion as to whether or not that is a -- is your research consistent with that statement that Marlboro -- or light smokers will switch to lights in lieu of quitting?

A.   Yes.  That was particularly true when they did this market research study.  These are focus groups that they had done in 1979 and it's exactly why people switched to lights.  They thought they were getting less tar and nicotine and less risk of disease and doing something good for themselves.  And it was often used as a method to quit or as an alternative to quit because you thought you were sort of hedging your bets, so to speak.

Q.   And in your review of the materials, were you aware of any efforts by Mr. John Barbose to try to quit smoking at a time period in the late '80s, early 1990s when he was also smoking the Marlboro Lights?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You mentioned earlier the -- and you talked about it briefly with the vent holes, how it would

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=369
1738

affect the testing results.  And can you explain what that -- you talked about it earlier.  Are you referring to the FTC test method?

A.   Right.

Q.   The Cambridge method?

A.   Right.

Q.   And what did the cigarette industry do with that information that was coming from those test results?

A.   Well, the standard testing, which was a 35-millimeter draw on a cigarette, which is not reflective of how people smoked, necessarily, but that standardized method, you know, they would take the tar and nicotine numbers that they got that were required to be turned over to the FTC every year, and they put it in their advertising as a way of saying you were getting less tar and nicotine when, in fact, internally they knew, because of compensation, smokers wouldn't be.

Q.   And you had testified earlier that the Marlboro Lights, when they first came on the market --when was that?

A.   1972.

Q.   -- they had a -- they had -- part of the package said what?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=370
1739

A.   Lowered in tar and nicotine.  Actually, that label was on the pack, I think, until 2003.

Q.   And so the FTC was getting the reports of what the -- I'm sorry.  Strike that.

The industry was using the FTC reports, the test results, in their marketing efforts, is what you said?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And, eventually, did the FTC rescind that position?

A.   Yes, they did.

MR. CLARK:  PT5480, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is from the Federal Trade Commission website dated November 26, 2008.  "FTC rescinds guidance from 1966 on statements concerning tar and nicotine yields."

When did the FTC start the testing?

A.   Well, the testing began in '67.  The first report on tar and nicotine content, I believe, came out in '68.  So this went on.  And still, actually, they're required to send in the results to FTC, but they can no longer report those results on cigarette packs or in advertising because it's completely misleading to consumers.  And that's --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=371
1740

Q.   Well, let's read what the FTC says.  "In addition, the Commission believes the statements of tar and nicotine yields, as measured by this test method, are confusing at best and are likely to mislead consumers, who believe they will get proportionately less tar and nicotine from lower rated cigarettes than from higher rated brands.  The Commission will not allow its stamp of approval on a test method that is confusing or misleading to consumers.  Our action today" -- the bottom's highlighted.

"Our action today ensures that tobacco companies may not wrap their misleading tar and nicotine ratings in a cloak of government sponsorship. Simply put, the FTC will not be a smokescreen for tobacco companies' shameful marketing practices." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to kind of shift gears here and get us to the point where we need to be in one hour.

Let's go back to the conspiracy to cover up and the cigarette controversy.

A.   Okay.

Q. The Tobacco Institute, you testified, was a public relations arm of the industry. And so what I want to talk about is, in the 1960s, did the Tobacco

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=372
1741

Institute take a look at what the purpose of the TIRC and the CTR and the Tobacco Institute, what their purpose for the industry was?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And who was Earle Clements?

A.   Earle Clements at one time was the president of the Tobacco Institute, I believe, in the late 1960s.

Q.   Okay.  And was the industry aware in 1968 that they were making false and misleading statements?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And who was William Kloepfer? MR. CLARK:  Let's put up 2130. THE WITNESS:  He was vice president for the

Tobacco Institute in charge of public affairs. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And this is April 15th, 1968, William Kloepfer to Earle Clements.

MR. CLARK:  Go down to it. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subject to the charge and may be subject to a finding that we are making false or misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes."

Based on your research was, in fact, the cigarette companies, including Philip Morris and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=373
1742

R.J. Reynolds, making false and misleading statements to promote the cigarette sales -- or the sale of cigarettes?

A.   Yes, they were.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT718, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Back to Earle Clements, what did he do before he went to work for the Tobacco Institute?

A.   He was a senator.

Q.   Do you know from where?

A.   I believe North Carolina.

MR. CLARK:  This is Bates 12. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And before we read this, what are they doing here with this document?  What are they talking about?

A.   This is a Brown & Williamson document. They're talking about the smoking and health controversy.  This is in 1969, and they're talking about reestablishing the smoking controversy and how to get their message out that it was -- you know, there was doubt about the risks of smoking and how to communicate that.  And they're basically discussing what -- you know, what their product of this advertising public relations campaign -- which, in fact, was executed, it's referred to as "Project

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=374
1743

Truth" -- that they were putting together.

Q.   "Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public.  It is also the means of establishing a controversy."

And you've mentioned Project Truth.  Was that a campaign that they, meaning the tobacco industry, implemented to continue to establish that there's a controversy about the health effects of smoking?

A.   Yes.  At this time, they talk about reestablishing the controversy, because they were referring back to when they had started it back in 1953.

Q.   Had they been promoting the idea of a controversy all the way back to 1953?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, asked and

answered.

THE COURT:  I'll sustain that objection. Move on, Counsel. MR. CLARK:  PT52 6. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Is this one of those particular Project Truth ads?

A.   Yeah.  They did public service ads.  When

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=375
1744

cigarette ads went off television, these were run by the Tobacco Institute as a public service advertisement.  And they were advertising their white paper called The Cigarette Controversy.

JUROR BIRD: Your Honor, I have a question. Can that projector be lowered so that we can see the screen?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"Here in Washington, a lot goes on that you never hear about.  Take the controversy about cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a house committee heard testimony from leading experts on smoking and health.  The record shows that many of the country's most respected doctors openly challenged anti-cigarette claims.  A California doctor said, 'As a scientist, I find no persuasive evidence that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.'

"A New York doctor told Congress, 'To claim there is now sufficient scientific evidence to establish that cigarette smoking causes disease is, in my opinion, unjustified.'

"There is another side to the cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=376
1745

controversy.  It's all here in this white paper.

Simple." BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   When smokers would write in for that white paper, what would they receive?

A.   Well, they would receive, you know, a document.  They called it The Cigarette Controversy White Paper.  It was done in a Q-and-A type format for lay public.  And they were, you know, addressing questions like, Does cigarette smoking cause lung cancer?  Their answer would be no.  And then they would go on to say, Leading doctors would challenge that evidence, like you heard.

And, you know, at the time, we didn't know about those leading doctors.  We assumed they were independent.

Q.   Do you now know who they were?

A.   Yes.  Now that I have all the budgets from --

Q.   Who are they?

A.   -- the Council For Tobacco Research, we know that they were paid for by the lawyers under special projects.

Q.   Hold that thought for a second. MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT1913. BY MR. CLARK:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=377
1746

Q.   What are we seeing here?  Who is this to and from, Dr. Cummings?

A.   This is in 1982.  It's from two attorneys at R.J. Reynolds, a Wayne Juchatz, who was in the law department, to his boss, actually Mr. Witt, who was chief general counsel at the time at R.J. Reynolds. And they're referring to an interview that they did with Dr. DiMarco, who came in to be vice president of research and development at R.J. Reynolds at the time. And they're recounting the interview and some of the concerns that were raised by Dr. DiMarco.

Q.   All right.  Let's take a look.

"During his law department orientation, he said that he thinks it is essential for R&D to work on the development of a less mutagenic cigarette." What is a less mutagenic cigarette?

A.   One that's less likely to cause DNA damage to the cells, which is the beginning process of the development of cancer.

Q.   "He believes that this is the prudent, responsible thing to do, but has been told by the lawyers, Ed Jacob, that he can't do this work.  I explained our legal concerns about the admission implicit in the words "less mutagenic" or "safer" that our existing products are mutagenic or unsafe.  He

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=378
1747

seemed to understand our concern but refused to accept it as a rationale for not doing what he felt we had an obligation to do as a responsible manufacturer.  He also said, although I can't recall his exact words, that that our medical scientific witnesses will say whatever we want them to say, clearly implying, if not stating, that they lacked credibility and integrity."

Now, Dr. Cummings, we've seen a lot of documents over the past couple of days --

MR. CLARK:  I'm sorry if I missed it. Thank you, Mr. Bigger. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   The people that you identified on Project Truth, who were they?

A.   Project Truth?

Q.   Yes.

A.   Those were the public relations experts for the Tobacco Institute, and there were a whole variety of them.  Anne Browder and --

Q.   I'm sorry.  Maybe my question wasn't clear. When we saw the video of Project Truth --

A.   Okay.

Q.   -- the gentleman on the video referred to imminent doctors and scientists.  Who were those individuals?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=379
1748

A.   Well, those were the doctors who were on special projects that were paid by the companies.  And they were selected by lawyers by the tobacco companies, Ed Jacobs being one of those.

Q.   And the gentleman in the video was referring to doctors who had testified before Congress on behalf of the industry.

A.   Yes.  They -- you know, special project folks were the scientists who came and spoke to Congress at various Congressional hearings in the late '60s and early 1980s and later in the 1990s.  And they turned out all to be on the payroll of the cigarette companies.  And they were selected by the lawyers to give the industry's position.

Q.   During the course of the later half of the 20th century, was the industry concerned about certain research being conducted in the United States, or were they also concerned about certain reports that might be available regarding certain research projects?

A.   Sure.  There was a lot of concern about what was in their files.  They had a very sophisticated way of either rewriting or removing things from files.

Q.   Let's a look at one, if you don't mind.

A.   Sure.

1749

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who's Max Crohn?

A.   He was in the legal department of R.J. Reynolds.  And this is a memo authored by Murray Senkus, who's vice president for R&D at Reynolds at the time.  This is 1969.  And Dr. Senkus is basically being asked to respond to a request from the legal department about how they handle reports.

Q. "We do not foresee any difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove certain reports from research files. Once it becomes clear that such action is necessary for the successful defense of our present and future suits, we will promptly remove all such reports from our files."

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor � I'm sorry. Can we read the paragraph immediately preceding what was just published? THE COURT:  Yes, please.

MR. CARTER:  Subsequent.  I'll let plaintiff finish what they're doing first.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go ahead and read -- yeah. Go ahead and just blow it up for me.  I'll make sure I --

THE WITNESS:  You want me to read it? BY MR. CLARK:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=381
1750

Q.   Go ahead, if you don't mind.

A.   Sure.  "As a rule, we invalidate about 15 reports each year for various reasons.  The most common reasons for invalidating a report and/or requiring rewriting are discoveries of inaccuracies in data, erroneous interpretation of data, purposeless speculation on data, needless replication of reports previously reported and discussions, undue delays in finalizing reports, confidentiality of contents, and several miscellaneous reasons.

"As to the reports which you are recommending to be invalidated, we can cite misinterpretation of data as reasons for invalidation.  A further reason is that many of these are needless repetitions and are being removed to alleviate overcrowding of our files. As an alternative to invalidation, we can have the authors rewrite those sections of the reports which appear objectionable."

Q.   You talked about the special projects.  I don't know.  Maybe you mentioned it or not.  But what was the Committee of Counsel?

A.   Committee of Counsel was the law, and these were the chief general counsels of each of the companies.  And when you look at the organizational structures for the Tobacco Institute and the Council

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=382
1751

For Tobacco Research, you had the executive committee. They were sort of on top of everything.  And then you had underneath it a law department, or what they often referred to as the Committee on Counsel.  And they really set the stage for who would be hired, what would be said, all of the policies related to the tobacco Institute and CTR.  So they really controlled everything in terms of what got communicated to whom.

Q.   Did they also control what type of research would be conducted?

A.   They did.  As I said, the special projects were not vetted by scientists who do peer review and select them based on scientific merit, as you would expect.  These special projects were selected by attorneys for -- under the chief general counsel.  And they were really selected for defensive purposes, that is, to try to counter the evidence that smoking caused disease and alternative causation.  Particularly they talked about the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial hypothesis, anything but smoking, in other words.

So those were the priority areas for special projects.  And, of course, they used some of those scientists as witnesses and also reported their findings in their public relations, because nobody

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=383
1752

would believe the industry, but they would believe leading doctors and scientists.  So that was the way they kept the controversy going.

Q.   Now, I mentioned it about conducting activities outside of the United States.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT1051, quickly. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Please explain what Cologne is.

A.   It's outside -- in Europe.  It's a town in Europe.  And basically this is -- Philip Morris had a lab called INBIFO that they set up to do a lot of their biological research, that is, biological harmful effects on the biological system.  So animal studies predominantly on the health effects of smoking was done overseas, and this is authored by notes from Tom Osdeen, who was one of the chief scientists at Philip Morris, about receiving documents to be sent to his home.

Q.   What does he say here, if you don't mind, Dr. Cummings?

A.   "Ship all documents to Cologne by 1.  If important letters have to be sent, please send to home. I will act on them and destroy."

MR. CLARK:  PT2201, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=384
1753

Q.   We just saw what was referencing INBIFO.

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this document as well, right?  This is Philip Morris?

A.   Yeah.  This is Helmut Wakeham talking to his boss.  You know, Charlie Goldsmith was -- in the late '60s was the president of Philip Morris.  And he's talking about setting up the program, as I mentioned, INBIFO.  And they bought this lab over in Europe, and they set up to do their studies so they could have the information.  They needed the information, obviously. But they put it offshore so the information couldn't be discovered.

Q. So I want to make sure it's clear. INBIFO is the facility at Cologne?

A. That's right. There was a lab over there and they bought it. And it's -- INBIFO is the acronym for it.

Q.   Since we have it, let me read this for you. I thought you had read it, Dr. Cummings.  I apologize. "Since we have a major program at INBIFO and since this is a locale where we might do some of the things which we are reluctant to do in this country, I recommend that we acquire INBIFO either in toto or to the extent of controlling interest."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=385
1754

Did I read this correctly?

A.   Yes.  And this is a memo obviously, where they were contemplating purchasing.  They did purchase. And the memo from Dr. Osdeen about destroying the documents were in the '70s.  So this is the late '60s. So they bought INBIFO.  And then he's talking about the transfer of documents back and forth.

Q.   Now, continuing on, the controversy.  We mentioned his name earlier, Joseph Cullman, III.  And what was his position in the early 1970s with the industry?

A.   Well, he was chairman of the board of Philip Morris, and he also, in the early '70s, was the chairman of the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.  He also had a major role on the executive committee for CTR at that time as well.

Q.   And did he appear on Face the Nation in 1971 on behalf of the industry?

A.   He did, in his role as president of the executive committee speaking on behalf of the members of the Tobacco Institute.  He appeared in January of 1971.  And the date is significant because that's when cigarette ads went off broadcast television and radio. So that was the news story.  And he appeared on Face the Nation to answer questions about smoking and

"From CBS Washington, in color, Face the Nation, a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Cullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris, Incorporated, and chairman of the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.

"We have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking.  We do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.  Because when, as, and if any ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to human health, we are confident that we can eliminate that ingredient.

"Do you believe cigarettes are safe?  Have they been proved to be safe, Mr. Cullman?

"I believe they have not been proved to be unsafe.  I did read that report, and I concluded

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=387
1756

from that report that it's true that babies born

from women who smoke are small.  But they're just

as healthy as the babies born from women who do

not smoke."

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   The report he's referring to right there, what was that report?

A.   There was a medical study that had come out showing that women who smoked when they were pregnant were more likely to have small babies.

Q.   And he makes the statement that they're not proven to be safe.  Was this yet another opportunity that the industry could have come clean with what they knew?

A.   Yes, of course.

Q.   And they didn't do that?

A.   No.  He misled the public about the safety of cigarettes, which they clearly understood at that point caused cancer.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT2050. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is the Roper proposal.  What is this about, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Sure.  This is from Fred Panzer.  He's a vice

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=388
1757

president for the Tobacco Institute, to Horace Kornegay.  He replaced Earl Clements as the president of the Tobacco Institute.  He had formerly been a congressman.  And, you know, Mr. Panzer is basically recounting the cigarette controversy. And he says, "For nearly 20 years, the industry has employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts, litigation, politics, and public opinion.  While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us win important battles, it is only fair to say that it is not, nor was it intended, to be a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it."

Q.   Based on your research, based on some of the documents we've seen, as well as others, was that the sole purpose of the TIRO, the CTR, and the TI and purpose of the industry, was to create doubt about the health charge?

A.   Yes.  When you look at the internal business records of the company, they talk about it as a defensive operation.  I think we saw that earlier in 1957.  Here they're talking about it as a brilliantly conceived strategy to create doubt in the public's

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=389
1758

mind.  You can see other documents that talk about TIRC as a public relations gesture, a shield, a front.  It was a fraud.

Q.   Let's shift gears slightly for a topic here, and let' s talk a little bit more about youth marketing, if we can.

A.   Okay.

MR. CLARK:  Let's show PT1641. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And what is this document?

A.   This is a presentation by Mr. Tucker --Charles Tucker of R.J. Reynolds, to the board of directors of R.J. Reynolds in September of 1974.  He is talking about the marketing plans for R.J. Reynolds in 1975.  So he's laying out the plans for marketing and who the target audience will be for their advertising going forward.

Q.   And if you could read those two paragraphs that are highlighted, please?

A.   Sure.  He says, "First let's look at the growing importance of the young adult in the cigarette market.  In 1960, this young adult market, the 14 to 24 age group, represented 21 percent of the population and, as seen by this chart, they will represent 27 percent of the population in 1975.  They represent

Q.   Yes, sir.  Please, go ahead.

A.   "Both Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, and particularly their fast-growing major brands Marlboro and Kool, have shown unusual strength among these younger smokers.  In the 14 to 24 age category, Philip Morris has a 38 percent share and Brown & Williamson has a 21 percent share.

Q.   This is January 23rd, 1975, stamped, "RJR Secret, Mr. C.A. Tucker.  Our attached recommendation to expand nationally the successfully tested 'Meet the Turk' ad campaign and our new Marlboro type blend is another step to meet our marketing objective.  To increase our young adult franchise" --let me stop right there.

We just saw from the previous document what that young adult market is, and that is what? A.   Well, as they say right here in this

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=391
1760

document, 14 to 24 age group.

Q.   -- "to ensure increased and longer-term growth for Camel filter, the brand must increase its share penetration among the 14 to 24 age group, which we have a new set of -- which have a new set of more liberal values and which represent tomorrow's cigarette business."

Based on what we've seen so far, can you describe for the jury how extensive the cigarette industry's plans were to market cigarettes to teenagers between the 1920s all the way up to at least the mid 1970s?

A.   It' s been --

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I object, calls for a narrative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It's been the key to the success of every brand and company to capture a share of the youth market.  And here they're talking about reformulated Camels, so a new version of Camel.  They finally joined with Marlboro with adding ammonia to reconstituted sheet, and that was the reformulated Camel blend that was introduced and marketed.  And this really began the effort to remake Camel from a cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=392
1761

that had sort of aged out to try to replenish it

with young adult � primarily young adult males.

And they began that process in earnest in the mid

'70s.  And this is the beginning of it with their

Meet the Turk campaign.  And then it goes on to

Joe Camel. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   What is the Meet the Turk campaign?

A.   Well, this is the campaign -- again, they tried to -- they created a character, Turk, who was sort of a macho guy to, you know, compete with the cowboy.  And --

Q.   And the cowboy meaning who?

A.   Well, that was Marlboro.  Marlboro was the leading brand being sold among teenagers at that time. It still is today.

Q.   From time to time, would the cigarette industry receive letters from schools and teachers inquiring about the position of the tobacco companies on smoking and health?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you familiar with some of those?  Have you seen some of those?

A.   I have a collection of hundreds of letters that were sent to consumers, both adult smokers as well

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=393
1762

as school children and school teachers who wrote to the company asking for information.  It was sort of a standard reply letter that was sent out giving the industry's positions on issues related to smoking and health.  And when they dealt with youth, they would usually say, We don't market to youth.

Q.   Was that a true statement?

A.   No.  But based on the internal business records that were not public, it's very clear that they designed cigarettes for young people, they developed their marketing campaigns to try to attract young people, put them in places that would be attractive to young people.  So they were clearly focused on replenishing the crop, as they talked about in 1965, Philip Morris, talking about the need to get young smokers.

Q.   Let's take a look at one.

MR. CLARK:  That's PT1252, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is May 1st, 1963, to the fourth graders, Room 22 at Geiger School, Tacoma Washington.

"Dear students, thank you for thinking of us in connection with your school research project.  As you know, opinions regarding smoking are by no means uniform.  Our feeling has always been that smoking is a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=394
1763

pass time for adults and that young people should not smoke."

Is that statement consistent with what they acknowledged in their own internal documents?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, asked and answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   If you'll read this paragraph, please. A.   Sure.  "Despite many years of extensive research, medical science has been unable to establish that smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease.  We are firmly of the opinion, however, that definitive answers to the many unanswered smoking and health questions and the true causes of human disease can be determined only by scientific research.  Our company intends, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth is known." Q.   What year is this?

A.   1968.  And we know that because they reference, I think in the prior paragraph, the Council for Tobacco Research.  And as I pointed out, they changed the name Tobacco Industry Research Committee to the Council For Tobacco Research in March of 1964.  So

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=395
1764

this is 1968.

Q.   Have you seen research -- have you seen documents and have you conducted research as to whether or not smoking was quite often seen as a right of passage for teenagers?

A.   Sure.  I think we've seen one where they talked about it being a right of passage.  And that's certainly true.

Q.   Let's take a look at another one here. MR. CLARK:  This is PT1577. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   This is April 7th of 1972, to Mr. Kenneth Bersinger, Fifth Grade, Room 404, Will Rogers Elementary School, 2401 14th Street, Santa Monica, California.  "Despite all the research going on, medical science has not found any conclusive evidence that an element in tobacco or tobacco smoke causes any human disease.  The answers to the many unanswered smoking and health questions and the true causes of human disease can, we believe, be determined by scientific research.  Our company intends, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth is known."

That sounds very familiar to the previous document.  Was that, in fact, what the industry was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=396
1765

doing?

A.   The industry knew that they had the answers about smoking and health.  They knew their product caused disease.  But, yes, they continued to fund research because they needed to continue to fund the research to keep the illusion that there was a controversy and more research was needed.  And they did continue that research until the Council For Tobacco Research was forced to go out of business in 1998. MR. CLARK:  Let me go to PT1040, please.

1040. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And the title of this was -- it's R.J. Reynolds Confidential Research Planning Memorandum on Some Thoughts About New Brands of Cigarettes for the Youth Market.

Who's the author of this document?

A.   This is Claude Teague.  So Dr. Teague had --at this time in his career at Reynolds had been promoted.  He's basically in charge of new product development at R.J. Reynolds.  And he writes a number of internal memos, one of which was on capturing the share of the youth market and how to engineer products that would have unique appeal to capture that share of young people as they're experimenting with cigarettes

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=397
1766

while holding on to what he refers to as the confirmed smoker.

Q.   And if you'll please read these two paragraphs, please.

A.   Yeah.

It says, "For the presmoker and learner, the physical effects of smoking are largely unknown, unneeded or actually quite unpleasant or awkward.  The expectant or derived psychological effects are largely responsible for influencing the presmoker to try smoking and provide sufficient motivation during the learning period to keep the learner going despite the physical unpleasantness and awkwardness of the period.

"In contrast, once the learning period is over, the physical effects become of overriding importance and desirability to the confirmed smoker. And the psychological effects, except for the tension relieving effects, largely wane in importance or disappear."

Q.   And based on their documents, how old were the learners?

A. Well, these are -- you know, you're basically talking about uptake of smoking, and uptake of smoking is primarily in teenagers. Average age of initiation, I think, is 14.  Uptake of regular daily smoking is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=398
1767

around 16 or 17 years of age.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, under the rule of

completeness, may we have the first paragraph on

this page immediately preceding published? THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Table 1 attempts to define some of the more important effects expected or derived from cigarette smoking by presmokers, learning smokers and confirmed smokers.  If this -- if this incomplete subjective simplistic analysis is even approximately correct, there are sharp, perhaps exploitable, differences between presmoker, learners and confirmed smokers in terms of what they expect to deprive from smoking.  Let us examine these differences."

Did the cigarette industry exploit teenagers of America for profits?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to go back to something that I missed a little bit earlier.  We were talking about the purpose of CTR, the Tobacco Institute, TIRC.

MR. CLARK:  Let's show PT2268. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We're going to come back to this stuff in a minute, but I want to show this for a minute.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=399
1768

And this is from R.B. Seligman.  Who's that?

A.   He was vice president for research, R&D at Philip Morris.

Q.   And this is dated November 17th, 1978.  The subject is a meeting in New York.  What -- who -- who was meeting in New York?

A.   Well, this was, you know, some of the lawyers for the tobacco companies, some scientists from companies, and external legal counsel for the cigarette companies.  They're really talking about CTR, the Council for Tobacco Research.  This was essentially a meeting of an ad hoc committee looking at the role of CTR.

So the lawyers and a few of the scientists were being asked to give their views, and they talk about the history of why Council for Tobacco Research or TIRC was set up originally, where the money has been best spent, and what they needed to be doing going forward.

Q.   So we saw we have representatives and attorneys from -- as well as executives from Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds present at this meeting. Let's see what the first paragraph says.

A.   It said:  "At the outset, Arnold Hensey" --

Q.   He's going to blow it up.  I'm sorry.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=400
1769

A.   -- "reminded all participants of the meeting, that there should be no written record of what transpired issued for distribution."

Q.   Next page, please.  Starting with that paragraph, "As a means of introduction."

A.   Yeah.

"As a means of introduction, Bill Shinn" --that's one of the lawyers -- "described the history, particularly in relation to CTR.  CTR began as an organization called Tobacco Industry Research Council, TIRC.  It was set up as an industry 'shield' in 1954. That was the year statistical accusations relating smoking to disease were leveled at the industry; litigation began; the Wynder-Graham reports were issued.  CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information which was needed at court trials.  CTR has supplied spokesmen for the industry at Congressional hearings.  The monies spent at CTR provide a base for the introduction of witnesses.

"Bill Shinn feels that 'special projects' are the best way the monies are spent.  On these projects, CTR has acted as a front.  However, there are times when CTR has been reluctant to serve in that capacity. In rare instances, they have refused to serve in that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=401
1770

capacity."

MR. CARTER:  The one below it. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   I'll read this one.

"It was at this time that special" -- I'll go back up the beginning.

"CTR began to lose their luster in the mid-'60s, and the tobacco industry looked around for more beneficial ways to spend their research dollars on smoking and health.  It was at this time that special projects were instituted at Washington University, Harvard University and UCLA.  Bill Shinn noted that the industry received a major public relations plus when monies were given to Harvard Medical School."

Based on what we've seen and your research, did the CTR, the TIRC and the Tobacco Institute serve as a front and a defensive operation for the industry?

A.   According to their own internal documents, they did.  And based on my research of all the research that they funded and all the papers that got published, over 6,000 papers, only about 600 of the 6,000 papers funded by CTR and TIRC during its entire 45-year history, essentially, had anything to do with smoking and health.

So 90 percent of their research was on topics

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=402
1771

unrelated to what they had told the Department of

Justice that they were going to do.

Q.   The TI provided spokespeople for television,

speeches and things of that nature, I believe is what

you said before?

A.   The Tobacco Institute, yes.  They spoke --

they were the spokesperson for their members, the

cigarette manufacturers, on issues related to smoking

and health.

Q.   And who are we looking at here? MR. CLARK:  This is PT1683L.

THE WITNESS:  This is Anne Browder, and she was one of the public relations experts from the Tobacco Institute who walked in and appeared on local and national news.  Here, she's, in October of 1983, appearing on the show "20/20" because the companies of each had -- were each asked to send a spokesperson to appear on the show and they sent Ann Browder instead.

MR. CLARK:  Let's hear it.

(The following video clip was played before the jury.)

"This is 20/20.  On the ABC news magazine, 20/20, tonight, Kids Under 21, America's Youngsters.  Are they the new target for cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=403
1772

manufacturers?

"Spokesmen for the industry say no, but cigarette advertising is everywhere.  Sporting events, rock and jazz concerts, billboards, in magazines, and give-aways.

"For almost 30 years the research and the warnings on many harmful effects of cigarette smoking have multiplied.  But where in 1954, the number of cigarettes sold was 387 billion, this year's estimate is 617 billion.

"Now, one fact that may help clarify that progression of events is that more money is spent for promoting cigarettes than for any other product, and some of those promotions seem aimed at children.

"Smoke anywhere and you enjoy the cigarette of fine tobacco.  Lucky Strike.

"It was 12 years ago that cigarettes were banned from radio and TV.

"Tareyton smokers would rather fight, than switch.

"I forgotten what these ads were like.  It's amazing to watch them now.

"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=404
1773

"The growing evidence of these products were killing people eventually led to their ban from broadcasting.  The tobacco companies, however, still claim the health hazards haven't been proven.

"We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard to appear on this program.  None would.  They told us to talk to the Tobacco Institute.  The Institute said Ann Browder would speak for them.

"The case is still open.  The jury has not come in.

"It may not be harmful?  You're not convinced"

"It may be or it may not be.  We don't know.

"How can you say it might not be harmful yet? Most of the people who die of lung cancer smoke. I mean, how can there not be a connection?

"We're certainly aware of the fact that people die on a daily basis.  Some of them are smokers, some of them are not smokers.

"Call for Phillip Morris."

"Even though they say they're not convinced that cigarettes kill, the tobacco companies say they voluntarily canceled their radio and TV ads

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1774

before Congress banned them.

"We feel very strongly that cigarette smoking is an adult custom.  That one should not consider until they've reached the age of maturity.

"What's maturity?

"Anyone over the age of 21.

"But studies show that 80 percent of all smokers started before they were 21.

"The cigarette manufacturers are not interested in obtaining new business from teenagers in our society.

"But how can you stay in business if you can't hook the kids?

"We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting to hook kids. We do everything possible to discourage teenage smoking."

"Do they?

"Recently, tobacco companies have found new ways to display their products where kids can be impressed.

"Can't advertise on television, sponsor a tennis tournament that's covered on television.

"Many baseball stadiums, when someone hits a home run, some brand of cigarette gets on TV.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=406
1775

Games like this one have about 40,000 viewers under 21.

"When we went to a team America soccer game, what impressed us was how thorough cigarette sponsorship can be.  You can't go anywhere without seeing Winston.  The ticker takers wear Winston hats.  And once you're inside, you're greeted by young women who give Winstons away.

"Cigarettes, cigarettes.

"Would you like regular or --

"Give me regular.

"Even the ladies selling programs wears Winstons.

"Programs for sale.

"Reynolds Tobacco says the audience here is predominantly adult, but there are lots of kids at soccer games.  The North America Soccer League says soccer's the fastest growing sport among teenagers.  Some of kids here wear their free Winston hats.  Helps keep the sun out of your eyes as you watch the cheerleaders.

"And even at halftime, you get Winstons. You win money if you kick the ball through the Winston sign.

"Soccer is very popular with kids.  You

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1776

cannot go to that game without seeing Winston everywhere.  Why?

"Why not?

"You just said you don't want to expose kids.

"That's not the same.  That is not encouraging anyone to smoke, John.

"If the purpose of it isn't to sell cigarettes, why do they sponsor it, out of the goodness of their heart?

"I would imagine that's part of the reason why they sponsor it because they've been approached by various people for sponsorship and --

"Just to be good guys.

"Sure.

"They're also doing a lot of associating with music.  There's the KOOL JAZZ Festival.

"Barbara Mandrell's gotten money from Marlboro.

"Juice Newton and Alabama's current tour is sponsored by Salem.

"Of course, the cigarette company doesn't need the musician's permission if it wants to promote its brand outside the concert.  Here, they're passing out free Camels.

"Tobacco companies have been doing a lot of this lately.  Their code says, We shall not give cigarettes away in any public place within two blocks of any center of youth activity.  Yet here, they're passing them out in front of a David Bowie concert.  Lots of kids here.

"Cigarettes were also passed out at concerts given by the Talking Heads and the Animals.

"You pass out free cigarettes at these concerts?

"I don't see you passing out free cigarettes at Frank Sinatra concerts.

"There are many, many adults at those concerts.

"Promoters of the concerts say 40 to 60 percent of the audience is under 21.  The tobacco code also says, Don't give tobacco products to anyone under 21.

"Well, we asked a 16-year-old to try to get some.

"Regular or light?

"Regular.  Thank you.

"I just went up and asked for cigarettes, and they didn't ask me for any ID or anything.  So I just got it and walked away.

"Reynolds Tobacco says they fire people who violate the sampling code.  We tried to ask the samplers about all this, but they said they've been told not to talk to the media.

"No, no, sorry.

"This videotape made last winter at a Chicago Lung Association shows young people being given Bright cigarettes.  Sixteen-year-old Joe was given a pack.  So was Paulette.  She's 18.  And Chris, he's 19.  Seven of nine young people who asked for cigarettes got them.

"So when the Chicago Lung Association's sent people out, kids got them.

"I cannot address that. I can tell you what the sampling code is for cigarette manufacturers, and the sampling companies are sworn to adhere by that code.

"But they don't obey it

"They are supposed to obey it.

"This is a commercial for KOOL cigarettes. This summer, Brown & Williamson began running ads for KOOL and BARCLAY at some 3,000 movie theaters. They wouldn't give us copies.  So we filmed them off the movie screen.

Newton, Massachusetts, right before a performance of Snow White.  Brown & Williamson says that was a mistake.  It should only run before R and PG films.  Of course, PG means the cigarette ad could run with kids' pictures like Star Wars and Superman.

"Even if movie advertising were banned, there would be cigarettes in movies popular with kids. These pictures are from Superman II.  Marlboro, made by Phillip Morris is shown at least 13 times.

"I asked the Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were shown so often in Superman II.

"Do you think cigarette manufacturers had something to do with that?

"Yeah.  I think that �

"Cigarette manufacturers don't make movies.

"But what do you think, that the -- the moviemaker just showed Marlboro on his own?

"Perhaps the moviemaker was a Marlboro smoker.

"We tried to ask the moviemaker, but he wouldn't talk to us.  Phillip Morris wouldn't comment on the financial arrangement except to say they didn't pay the producers cash.

"Maybe, of course, it doesn't matter.  Kids

see the billboards all the time.  Tobacco companies spend so much money on advertising that nearly every other billboard in America promotes cigarettes.

"I think the cigarette manufacturers have the right to advertise their product.  I think they have the right to sponsor a variety of events as they do.  I don't think it's illegal.  So why not?"

(The video clip concluded.)

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We heard a lot of stuff on that clip there,

Dr. Cummings, but I want to go to one -- one statement

in particular where Ann Browder was asked about whether

or not the cigarette companies, specifically Philip

Morris, put Marlboro in Superman II.

And since this was aired in 1983, have you

seen any documents that actually reflect that the

industry did, in fact, pay to have Marlboro advertising

in Superman II?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   Was Ann Browder telling the truth to the

America public when she's was asked that question?

A.   No.  She wasn't telling the truth.  It wasn't

the producer's preference for Marlboro.  It was the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=412
1781

cash that Philip Morris paid to the producer.

They wrote the scene in one part of the movie where Superman is thrown into a Marlboro truck in Superman II.  There's no thing as Marlboro trucks, by the way.  Cigarettes get delivered in gray vans.

But that scene was written and it was paid for by Philip Morris tobacco in 1979 when they produced that film, and Ann Browder appeared in that show in 1983.

Q.   One more -- one more document, and I think we're going to wrap it up for the day.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT3400. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And if you could introduce us to this document.  Who -- who wrote it and what's the subject of it?

A.   Sure.  This is a document authored by Diane Burrows at R.J. Reynolds labeled, Secret Strategic Research Report.  Diane Burrows is a market analyst for R.J. Reynolds.

It was written in 1984, and it's a 50-year look back at the brands that were popular among youth and why they became popular and how you could use that information going forward to capture a share of the youth market.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=413
1782

Q.   And who -- who received this document?

A.   Well, senior management Gerald Long was the president of R.J. Reynolds at the time. Mr. Orlowski is the head of advertising, later became head of Lorillard Tobacco.

Mr. Lees is the head of new product development at R.J. Reynolds in 1984 when this was authored.

Q.   Based on the documents the jury has seen from the 1920s, younger adult smokers, strategies and opportunities.

"The importance of younger adult smokers. Younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years.  They will continue to be just as important to brands, companies in the future for two simple reasons.  The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from 18-year-old smokers.  No more than 5 percent of smokers start after age 24.

"The brand loyalty of 18-year-old smokers far out weighs any tendency to switch with age." Your turn, Dr. Cummings.

A.   "Marlboro and Newport, the only true younger adult growth brands in the market have no need for switching games.  All of their volume growth can be

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=414
1783

traced to younger adult smokers and the movement of the 18-year-olds, which they have previously attracted into older age brackets where they pay a consumption dividend of up to 30 percent.

"A strategy which appealed to older smokers would not pay this dividend."

MR. CARTER: Your Honor, before we leave the page, may we have the opening paragraph under the heading purpose published?

THE COURT:  Yes. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Purpose.  This is intended to assist RJR in optimizing its strategic position with respect to younger adult smokers 18 to 24 by clarifying their importance versus smokers 25 plus.  Identifying strategies which have been most effective against younger adult smokers in the past and applying this learning to RJR and its current environment.

"Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement smokers.

I think you mentioned that earlier.

"Less than one-third of smokers, 31 percent, start after age 18.  Only 5 percent of smokers start after age 24.

"If younger adults turn away from smoking,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=415
1784

the industry must decline, just as a population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle."

What are we looking at here, Dr. Cummings?

A.   This is the appendix that they referred to in that particular part of the report.  And they're talking about younger adults' importance as replacement smokers, and they're -- this is from a Government report, Health, Education, Welfare.  That's what HEW stands for, where they're looking at current male smokers and the age at which they start to become regular smokers, and you can see it goes from age 12 up to 25.

And you've got about 68.7 start become regular daily smokers or the median age, 16.7 years, in which, you know, males became regular smokers.

Q.   One second.  And you said this data came from where?

A.   This is Government data.  They actually had surveyed adults, and they asked them what age did you become a regular smoker.  So that's how they get that information, and this is what you will find if you ask most smokers when they began smoking regularly.  The average age is between 16 and 17.

If it you ask it a slightly different way, when did you first puff on a cigarette, the average age

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=416
1785

is about 14.

Q.   And remind the jury, what's the earliest age we know John Barbose when he began smoking?

A.   Well, sometime around 14 or 15 years of age, based on the testimony.

Q.   Now, based on --

A.   His brother Sam said 15, I believe.

Q.   Sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off there.

A.   It's all right.

Q.   Now, based on the documents the jury's seen, going all the way back to the letters from 1920s where R.J. Reynolds was directing sales representatives to pursue high schoolers as well as these documents like this one from the 1980s, are you able to form an opinion about how long the tobacco industry has been targeting children?

A.   They've been targeting children right from the beginning.  From the dating of the modern cigarette, they want young people to be -- you know, start smoking because brand loyalties are started at an early age.

So it's not so much the first cigarette you may experiment with, but it's the first brand you go and buy and put your money down.  That's where the brand loyalties are established, and the companies that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=417
1786

are successful, as pointed out in this very detailed document, reflect the brands that were successful in the '30s and the '40s, Camel and Lucky Strike in particular, and then into the '50s and '60s where they talk about the success of Winston, and then Marlboro from the '60s and '70s going forward.

Q.   During the entire history of their business up until and including today, have they ever admitted that they market to and require children for their business?

A.   No.  Companies still deny that they ever marketed to youth, that they ever studied the smoking habits of youth, that they engineered their products to attract young people.  So they never have admitted that, ever.

Q.   Looking at the documents, what's the youngest age group you've seen the industry acknowledge that they study or target?

A.   Well, they talk about, you know, 18 and over because most states, that's the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, is 18.  So that's the group that they target.  But even there, they say they don't target non-smokers, they only advertise to smokers.  So somehow you've got to get from the non-smoking category into the -- into the smoking category.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=418
1787

Q.   Kind of alluded there, but let me -- let me clarify this.  What would happen to the cigarette industry naturally if they actually stopped targeting children or stopped getting thousands of kids to start smoking every day?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  I believe this witness can answer that question.

THE WITNESS:  In their own documents, I think we saw it.  There, they basically say their --their sales would dry up and their -- you know, they'd stop selling, you know, cigarettes because, you know, if you don't get them before the age of 24, you're not -- you're not going to get smokers taking up cigarettes for the most part.

MR. CLARK:  I believe it's 4:30, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  It's 4:32.

MR. CLARK:  It's 4:32.  I'm sorry.  I'm having trouble reading the clock at this time of the day.

MR. BIGGER:  Happy you're watching the clock.

THE COURT:  We tried, ladies and gentlemen. So we got close to 4:30.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to recess

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=419
1788

for the weekend.  I want to remind everyone of their obligations again not to discuss this amongst yourselves or even with family or friends.

Don't do any investigation, don't look at any newspaper or television about this case and do any other research, as I've indicated before, on the Internet.

So we're going to have you -- you don't need to report downstairs unless you left something downstairs in the jury assembly room.

Monday, if you could report there between 8:30 and 8:45, then come up here.  Hopefully, we'll be starting promptly at 9:00 a.m. on Monday.

I do want to remind you and let everyone know that we will be honoring Veterans Day next week on Wednesday, November 11th.  So we will not be in Court that day.

So it would be Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday of next week.  So enjoy your weekend.

We thank you for your attention and we look forward to seeing you on Monday.  Have a good weekend.

(Jury exited the courtroom at 4:33 p.m.)

THE BAILIFF:  All jurors are out of the hearing of the Court, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Any matters that need to be addressed before Monday?

MR. BIGGER:  I don't know if Your Honor wants to do it now or you want to do it Monday morning, but we could show that proffer, that clip.  It's a five-minute clip.

If you're tired, we can do it Monday.

THE COURT:  We could do it now.  I don't care.

MR. BIGGER:  Okay.  You want the witness to step out for that?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. BIGGER:  Just by way of background, so this is -- it's from a film called "Death in the West," but, obviously, the portion we intend to show or want to show the jury is their interviews of senior executives.

Your Honor's already heard their names, but it's Helmut Wakeham, who is, at the time, the head of R&D for Philip Morris, and then James Bowling, who was the senior vice president, and you probably saw his name on one of those last documents there.  The Ernie Pelvis document about CTR and the efforts.

James Bowling was also heavily involved in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=421
1790

CTR, TI. These are individuals whose names have been very prevalent in the documents. And we'll just play the clip.  I think it's five minutes.

And then Your Honor we --

(The following video clip was played before the jury.)

"As manufacturers of the world's biggest selling cigarette, are you concerned that the World Health Organization said that cigarettes are the cause of a worldwide epidemic of a disease that at present kills hundreds of thousands of smokers every year?

"Am I concerned?  I'm concerned (unintelligible) in a way you might not think. I'm concerned that people make claims, including those against our products, without adequate knowledge.  There has not been the sort of research really that would allow anyone to say that.

"There's a lot of people in organizations who are talking about the subject who really haven't done any research at all.  Until they can tell us, thus the world's public, what causes cancer, for example, then I don't really think they can pin down anything like that.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=422
1791

"I think it's very comfortable for a lot of people when they don't know to be able to find the target, and cigarettes because they're pleasurable or something, have been a very convenient target in a lot of areas.

"You must remember that it was not too long ago in this country that they said cigarettes cause tuberculosis.  The tragedy of science was that they literally quit looking for the real cause of TB.

"You know, seven states in the United States outlawed the sale of cigarettes as reached in the 1920s because they were sure they caused tuberculosis.  They thought it had nothing to with tuberculosis, but the tragedy of science was they quit looking for a while.

"How many people died as a result of that? That's what I think is very serious indeed."

"Is it possible that your refusal to accept the evidence may be colored by the fact that you make cigarettes?"

"Is that possible?  Well, of course, that's possible here.  I think I'm a fairly reasonable human being and not in any way removed from the other members of society.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=423
1792

"I certainly wouldn't be in the business if I thought cigarettes were harmful to people.  I think it's important that there be a lot of us around who are trying to keep the research honest and open.  I think the real dishonesty is telling people things that are not so."

"Are you saying that cigarettes are harmless?"

"I don't know that.  I don't know that they're harmful or harmless.  What I'm saying is hat someone should find out."

"If you were convinced that cigarettes were killing people, would you stop making cigarettes?"

"Well, I've personally been on the record on that for a long time. I'm not in the business of killing people, obviously.

"I've said all along that simply there are plenty of ways to make a living.  I happen to believe in what I'm doing very strongly.  But I also am, first of all, a human being.  And I certainly wouldn't give up fault, I would not smoke myself nor prevent my wife to smoke or my children to smoke, but I'm, I think, a rational human being.

"I think I've probably read more of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=424
1793

evidence than most people you'll ever meet.  A great deal more, probably, than a lot of the scientists who you've heard speaking out on the subject, and I choose to smoke.  I enjoy smoking. And so do 60 million other Americans and people all over the world."

"None of the things which have been found in tobacco smoke are at concentrations which can be considered harmful."

"But the components themselves can be considered harmful, can they not?"

"Anything can be considered harmful. Applesauce is harmful if you get too much of it."

"I don't think many people are dying from applesauce."

"They're not eating that much."

"People are smoking a lot of cigarettes."

"Well, I'll say it the best way.  People who eat applesauce die.  The people who eat sugar die. The people who smoke cigarettes die.

"Does the fact that the people who smoke cigarettes die demonstrate that smoking is the cause?

"There are polycyclic hydrocarbons in smoke."

"And they are carcinogenic."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=425
1794

"Under certain circumstances with test animals, some have been identified as so called carcins."

"The WHO report goes on to say there are also other carcinogens such as nitrosamines, (unintelligible).  There's also a wide variety of irritants like acrolein, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.  And co-carcinogens, including cresol and phenol.  Do your researchers show otherwise?"

"No. "

"You'd agree with that?"

"I agree that there's a great deal of literature which indicates that some of these substances are in smoke."

"And your own research shows that?"

"Some of them in some cases.  We -- we have not examined all of the substances."

"Can you say that cigarettes do no harm to the cigarette smoker?"

"I'm not in a position to say that.  I don't know what harms a cigarette smoker or what doesn't harm them.  I really honestly don't know that.

"You must be trying to get me to admit that cigarette smoking is harmful.  I think that if the company as a whole believe cigarettes were really

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=426
1795

harmful, we would not be in the business.  We're very a moralistic company.  I think management of Philip Morris is sincere in this position.

"I think there's a great deal of doubt as to whether or not cigarettes are harmful.  If you read both sides, not only the point of view of the people who are -- who have missionary zeal to make the world stop smoking, but the people who are trying to be objective with respect to this question, you'll discover there's a great deal of doubt with regard to whether or not smoking causes all the diseases which are alleged to be caused by smoking."

(The video clip concluded.)

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, for the record, the PT1699AC, obviously, now, Your Honor hs had a chance to see the clips.  You know who these individuals are.

THE COURT:  Well, I know just from the last -- the second individual wasn't even introduced until the end.

MR. BIGGER:  Sorry.  That was Dr. Wakeham.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  The first was Dr. � I should have --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=427
1796

The first one was James Bowling.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. BIGGER:  The second one was Dr. Helmut Wakeham.  Obviously, no one could put words in their mouth.  This is the things that they said based on questions the interviewer asked them. There's no alteration to what they said, the statements that they voluntarily gave.

THE COURT:  Well, that's not the representations that were made to me --

MR. BIGGER:  I understand that.

THE COURT:  � at the time of the hearing in that there were cuts and pastes and the Court could see the number of cuts even on the film that we watched.

MR. BIGGER:  Right.

THE COURT:  That was the basis of my ruling, not that it's really a statement against interest --

MR. BIGGER:  Right.

THE COURT:  � as to a corporate representative.

MR. BIGGER:  And to the extent that � that's the only video that we have.  To the extent -- if there's a transcript that has additional

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=428
1797

information in the rule of completeness that someone wants to have read, that's fine.  We'll read -- if there's additional statements they want to have read as part of the rule of completeness, which is, as I understand, I guess, the basis perhaps for His Honor's objection, I have no problem with that if someone gives us the transcript of what they want read.

The only thing that I think we have is a transcript of what they say.  Is that right?

We just don't have -- I don't have it.  I've never seen -- I'd love to see it, but I don't have a transcript that says they said something else.

The transcript I have appears to be someone who transcribed what they actually said on the clips that I've seen.

THE COURT:  That's not going to help.

MR. BIGGER: Right. So I'm not aware of this other transcript, and I'd love to see if it, if it does exist.

Of course there are, you know, cuts, but cuts in any of these things.  There's cuts in the stuff they're going to show as part of their case if they Harry Reasoner or Murray or whoever, you know.  Those things aren't live television very

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=429
1798

often.

The document we gave you last time from 197 6 was that summary afterwards where they talked about the fact they thought both witnesses were impressive and candid.  They thought the interviews were fair and done correctly.

It's only now in, you know, this being used, obviously, in a case that it becomes a concern for them, which I understand.  I do.  It's prejudicial, but it's not overly prejudicial.

THE COURT:  How long is the entire film?

MR. BIGGER:  The whole film?

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. BIGGER:  I think it's about an hour.

MR. CARTER:  I think it's like 30 minutes.

MR. BIGGER:  Maybe 35 minutes.

MR. THORNE:  And, Your Honor, there was a specific finding by the British courts that it was not -- it was taken out of context, there was cutting that was done in the actual film itself. They completely changed the interviews.

I believe that there is a transcript.  I don't have it here with me today, of that, but it was a specific finding by the Court.

As a result, they were not to disseminate

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=430
1799

that video anywhere.  As you heard, that that video made its way to some antitobacco advocates, and it's never been shown in the State of Florida, ever.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm not going to change my ruling from two weeks ago or whatever it was.  So that has been proffered, I understand, but my ruling will remain the same.

MR. BIGGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Anything else?

MR. BIGGER:  We just need to read some stuff into the record on the documents.  We want to move all that into evidence what we've done.  We've got a list, I think, hopefully, now that's complete and finalized.

So whoever wants to stick around for that process, of course, but nothing other than that, which we just quickly read that to the reporters. So we have all the PT numbers and we've -- able to move this process along pretty quickly.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  By way of planning, I think we'll finish up Dr. Cummings as early as possible on Monday morning.  We don't anticipate to have too much longer with him on direct.  You know,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=431
1800

we're doing our best, and it's -- candidly, it's just slightly longer than I thought.  I thought we'd finish today, but were just a little longer than I thought.

We'll start with cross and redirect, I guess, on Monday and possibly get to another witness on Monday, it just depends on the length of cross and redirect, but certainly by Tuesday morning we should be into additional witnesses, and I think we are on track for what I estimate as far as what our likely order of proof would be.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That sounds fine.

MR. CARTER:  In terms of orders, I know at one of our side bars there was some confusion perhaps about what was ruled.

We did have a draft prepared for orders of all of the defense motions and I think plaintiff's counsel has for a week now.  We'll try to confer with them and get an agreement over the weekend. If we don't, we'll submit contested proposed orders so Your Honor can go ahead and get something entered on those pretrial motions.

THE COURT:  We're going to have contested proposed orders?

MR. CARTER:  I presume we won't, but I don't

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=432
1801

know.  We --

THE COURT:  We have a transcript, you know.

MR. CARTER:  I agree.  I agree, Your Honor. I don't think it should be an issue.  I just don't know what's taken at this point.

MR. GEISE:  One thing with regard to the schedule on Monday, Mr. Bigger had represented to Ms. Yates and I before that Dr. Cummings is not available to be here on Tuesday.  I hope that they have a little bit of direct left, we can conduct cross, they can do the redirect and Dr. Cummings is done on Monday.

I'm just concerned that if the final part of the direct Monday morning doesn't go much quicker than today went, that we'll still be on our cross in the afternoon and we won't have time -- then we'll have an issue with a witness who leaves and they're going to want to take him out of order.

And I think after a witness has been here a day and a half, he's going to be here -- that would be the second day, then he should finish on Tuesday if we don't finish him on Monday afternoon.

MR. BIGGER:  As far as I know, the witness is still -- I'll check.  I'll confirm this, but I've

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=433
1802

been told by the witness that he has, obviously, work commitments.  He's got to be back and done by Monday.

A day and a half is a little of an over statement.  I think he started around 3:00 we finished at 5:00.  We finished today at 4:30.

So usually it's about -- it's about a two-day witness is what we anticipated.  That's about what he's probably going to be.  It's pretty close to that.

Depending upon the length of their cross, if -- if we have to take him later on and finish his cross or finish his redirect, that happens all the time of witnesses, as I'm sure Your Honor is familiar.

THE COURT:  Take him later on in a week from now, you're saying?

MR. BIGGER:  No, no, no, I mean, it might � I mean, it might be like later on at the end of next week if he can't finish up on Tuesday morning.

THE COURT:  Well, that's what I just said. Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.  Hope � I mean, it'll be -- I'm not suggesting they take him not in our

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=434
1803

case, but I mean, let me talk to the witness and find out.  But I understand from him that there's a reason he needs to leave by Monday night for work issues, but I'll talk with him and find out.

MS. YATES:  And just maybe have a little flexibility of the time, the ending Monday, if that's �

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.

MS. YATES:  I know that involves �

THE COURT:  That's fine with me just expecting a lot of this jury.  That's fine with me.  I don't have any plans.  So --

MR. BIGGER:  I mean, they're going to � I mean, yes -- hopefully, that won't be necessary. Obviously, next week will be a little better because they are going to have a day off.  It's just four -- four or five days next week.  So maybe if we have to do that one day next week, it's better than another week.

I appreciate that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything else from me?

You can read this into the record without my presence?

MR. BIGGER:  Fine with me.

MR. GEISE:  No objection, Your Honor.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=435
1804

THE COURT:  Any problems there?

MS. YATES:  No problem, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Then we will see you -- we're starting -- you want me on the bench earlier than 9 on o'clock Monday?

MR. CARTER:  We don't have any exhibit issues to deal with unless we get new exhibits over the weekend, which I presume, since they're trying to wrap up, will not happen.  So nothing from the defense perspective.

THE COURT:  Let Marc know if you need me earlier, but I'll plan on being on the bench at 9 o'clock.

All right.  Everyone have a good weekend.

MR. BIGGER:  On that point, obviously, they're not giving us their cross documents in advance.  So we have no idea what they are.

So, obviously, we hope there would not be an issue on Monday, but if there are objections to their documents, if they're really going to give them to us before they show them to the witness and we have to, you know, contemporaneously make objections to them at that time, we'll, obviously, do our best to do that expeditiously.  But if we don't get them -- if they show them to us and then

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=436
1805

show them to the witness, we won't have a chance to make objections unless they show them to us. So �

THE COURT:  I can't imagine there's any surprise there.  You all have been --

MR. BIGGER:  Well, I would think � right. Which is all the more reason that we'd think they would just be able to give them to us.  We can't talk to our witness while on he's on direct. We're not going to talk to him.

MR. CARTER:  He's still on direct.  So �

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(Pause in proceedings.)

PROCEEDINGS

(Court called to order at 8:46 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Please be seated.

All right.  Do we need the clerk for any of this?

MR. BIGGER:  I don't think at this second, Your Honor.

We have three documents we identified over the weekend or early this morning, unfortunately, that were not on the list that we previously provided.  We provided those to the defense.  One of them is PT504, which is, I've been told, okay to move into evidence with no additional objections other that those that have already been made in writing.

MR. CARTER:  That's correct, Your Honor.

MR. BIGGER:  The other two we'll know in just a moment if there is the same that your prior rulings on either motions in limine or the prior written objections or submissions or needs argument.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, if we just could check?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, that's fine.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=446
1815

MR. THORNE:  And, Your Honor, I have one document that they handed me, which is one page of what appears to be a Philip Morris website.  Just got it this morning.  I just looked, and I don't see it on the website.  I have no way of verifying where it came since we just got it this morning. But it appears to be statistics on smoking.  And if we look under the section on addiction on the current website, I don't see it there.

MR. BIGGER:  It's from 2013.  We can lay the foundation with the witness; that's fine.  Just trying to move things along.

THE COURT:  And this was not provided before or --

MR. THORNE: I just got it this morning, Your Honor. I haven't had any chance to look at it and determine its authenticity.

THE COURT:  How much time do you need to do that?

MR. THORNE:  I just need to call back to my office and check on it.

THE COURT:  We'll give you some time to do that.  And then we can perhaps deal with it at the break.

MR. BIGGER:  That's no problem.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=447
1816

And I'll say that, I mean, everything I gave them was on the exhibit list that was timely disclosed.  We simply didn't give them the two on the list we disclosed about a week ago, or I guess it was last Tuesday or Wednesday, for Dr. Cummings' potential exhibits.  We sent those over Tuesday.  These three were just not on there, and I apologize for that, obviously.  But we identified that and we're trying to do the housekeeping and making sure that the evidence is ready for the clerk.

Looking at what we moved into evidence on Friday, we noticed these three weren't on there, so that's why we gave it to them as soon as we noticed this morning.

THE COURT:  Is this something that you need this morning before the break?

MR. BIGGER:  No, I think we � I mean, we can certainly move them into evidence as long as the witness is still here.  If there's some -- for example, authenticity, there's an issue, I want to make sure the witness is still here to lay that proper predicate.

THE COURT:  All right.  Then we'll allow you some time to take a look at that.

1817

MR. BIGGER:  And then the other one, Your Honor, which is, I think, PT3405 -- is that right?

MS. YATES:  Yes.

MR. BIGGER:  � PT3405, consistent with Your Honor's prior rulings and their previous written objections of the defense, I don't think there's anything additional with those documents.  We can move that into evidence at this time; is that correct?

MR. THORNE:  That's correct, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You're going to move it into evidence now?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  It will be admitted into evidence as noted in the number.

MR. BIGGER:  And just for � I don't think it's necessary, but just to make sure it's clear, we read into evidence at the end of the day when Your Honor left.

THE COURT:  Yeah, I saw that on the transcript.

MR. BIGGER: A lengthy number of documents. All those were done with the presence of counsel there. I just want to make sure that it's clear that all those documents we read into evidence at

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=449
1818

the end of the day on Friday are into evidence?

THE COURT:  Those shall be admitted into evidence as noted on the record.

MR. BIGGER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

Okay.  Anything else?

MR. GEISE:  Your Honor, one issue that came up last week is the issue of both Dr. Cummings and Dr. Drobes being disclosed to give case-specific opinions in this case, including �

THE COURT:  How do you spell the doctor?  Is it Groves?

MR. GEISE:  Drobes, D-r-o-b-e-s.

Both of those individuals being disclosed in this case to give case-specific opinions, including opinions about Mr. Barbose's addiction before either one of those experts had any case-specific facts.  Mr. Bigger brought it up. We've looked at it and I think under 608, that we have a right to impeach and discuss and attack the credibility or the bias of any witness.  That would include their impartiality or any acts or relationships or motives that would be likely to produce partiality bias and they can be proved to impeach credibility.

In this case, I think we have a right and are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=450
1819

permitted to ask an expert if they're okay with the process where they are listed and disclosed as an expert on case-specific facts before they're retained in a particular case.  We should be able to ask them if they're okay being disclosed on case-specific facts before they have any of those. It demonstrates the witness's bias whether he could be adequately disclosed on a case-specific basis before they have a basis to form those opinions.

Similarly, in Mr. Bigger's opening, he used a slide with our addiction expert, Dr. Jill Hayes. And the last comment on the slide said she advertises her services on a website.  I assume that that process of advertising is designed to impeach her in some way down the road on her bias or her partiality or how she gets retained in these cases.

You know, it's not a situation where her website says, If you hire me, I'll give any opinion you want me to; or If it you hire me, I'll come into Court and say that the smoker is not addicted.

This is a situation where you will hear Dr. Cummings and Dr. Drobes in every case in which

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=451
1820

they've testified, they've testified that the smoker is addicted.  It goes to their bias in that they can predict what their opinion is going to be before they know anything about the facts of the case because that is, in fact, the opinion they always give in these cases.

I understand Mr. Bigger's concern that he doesn't want to look like it's a reflection on the attorneys.  And that is not our intent here. That's not the driver.  The fact of the matter is, they were just disclosed.  So if the concern is he doesn't want the disclosure itself to be an exhibit, it doesn't need to be an exhibit.  We didn't intend to do that.  We don't have to say that Mr. Bigger needs you.  The fact of the matter is, they'll agree, as they have in their depositions, including Dr. Cummings when he was shown the expert witness disclosure and the fact that it was dated and filed on March 6, 2015, he admitted that he did not review the disclosure before it went out.  He admitted that he had not talked to anyone or no one had talked to him about the disclosure before it was filed.  And he admitted that that disclosure was before he even received any materials in the Barbose case.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=452
1821

I think these are all fair and acceptable points for cross-examination for impeachment for bias or impartiality and he shouldn't be able to do it.

THE COURT:  Response?

MR. BIGGER:  Yes, sir.  If they want to ask questions about when he was disclosed, things of that nature, that's not the issue here.  The issue is what they said in their opening statement was that, in a legal paper -- I'm not sure they said -- we will show you, or something to that effect.  Dr. Cummings was identified -- these witnesses were identified in legal papers before they had even formed their opinions.

The legal papers themselves are hearsay.  So whether he wants to use them or not, there's no exception that allows him to put a piece of paper, a disclosure, into evidence, that I know of. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's hearsay.

The problem with attempting to impeach with this document is it's completely collateral, unlike Dr. Hayes who herself puts herself on a website, who holds herself out in such capacities because she does it for herself.  That was the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=453
1822

purpose of saying the reference to the website. She does that.  She goes there and she puts herself out in that light.

Dr. Cummings didn't draft this disclosure. The attorneys drafted this disclosure.  And so it's not a prior inconsistent statement or any kind of prior statement of his at all.  And the idea to suggest that somehow this disclosure and any errors or inconsistencies in this disclosure doesn't show that the witness is biased -- it's a totally collateral matter.  This is an effort of collateral impeachment on a matter that is completely collateral because it's only about any errors or anything that we, as lawyers, made a mistake of.

And I'll bring you a copy of the disclosure, Your Honor, if I may.

THE COURT:  You may.

MR. BIGGER:  The bottom paragraph there is, I think, the one they're making all this fuss about.

Just to show you how collateral this is, it says "is expected."

MR. GEISE:  What paragraph are you referring to?

MR. BIGGER:  That one.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=454
1823

"Is expected to."  It doesn't say he will or here's what his opinions are.  It doesn't even specify or to give an opinion on John Barbose being addicted.  There's nothing in there to suggest there was something or we wrote out what his opinions are.

That shows you how collateral this issue is. It's just a benign disclosure that says he is expected to testify case specific as to the following subject matters, addiction, here and here and here.  This is only intended for one purpose, to try and impugn the lawyers from making a mistake or trying to saying the lawyers and the expert are in cahoots and this is some improper thing, making it completely collateral and not an appropriate ground for impeachment under any rule of evidence.

MR. GEISE:  Certainly, we're permitted to ask the expert both at his deposition and here about the opinions that are set forth within the disclosure and their basis for those opinions at the time they were disclosed.

With regard to the paragraph Mr. Bigger is pointing to, it says, "The significance of decedent's specific smoking history habits,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=455
1824

addiction, and patterns.  So clearly, there's a disclosure there about the decedent already being addicted.  And if you look back a couple pages earlier, on page four, similarly for Dr. Drobes, he talks about -- in the last clause, he talks about the decedent's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine.  So it is disclosed there on a case-specific basis.

I have no desire to impugn Mr. Bigger on this point.  It goes to the experts and their process in these cases where they are comfortable being disclosed before they know anything, before they can form an opinion.  So that the disclosure itself does not need to be admitted.  We wouldn't seek to admit that.

We think, consistent with their depositions, both Dr. Drobes and Dr. Cummings would agree that they were disclosed as an expert in a case before they knew anything about the case and that that is their process and they're okay with that.  It goes to their bias and their participation in these lawsuits.

MR. BIGGER:  Did they say in their deposition that they're comfortable being disclosed on cases where they weren't consulted?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=456
1825

MR. GEISE:  We didn't ask that question, but we can ask him that here today.

MR. BIGGER:  The problem is, when you ask that question, if they say no, then it's impugning the lawyers.  That's why this is totally collateral.  To get at a pleading that a lawyer drafted and try and use that as some basis, they can ask him, When were you disclosed?  When you were disclosed, did you have any information?  He can say no.  You don't need to use the disclosure and the legal -- quote, the legal paper for this purpose.  They can still ask him these questions in a proper way that doesn't purely try to impugn the lawyers and that say the lawyers made a mistake or look what the lawyers did.  We're the ones that draft the disclosure.  The experts never draft a disclosure.  Their expert has never drafted a disclosure in any of the cases that I've asked about.

And I've used this disclosure and other disclosures like this in other cases and never had anyone try this before.

MR. GEISE:  Well, Your Honor � and that's the point, the disclosure is accurate.  They accurately predicted what these experts' opinions

were going to be after they learned about the case.  And that goes to this expert's bias, because they give the same opinion in every case about every smoker.  No matter what the facts are going to be, they can accurately be disclosed ahead of time.

MR. THORNE:  And, Your Honor, I had a disclosure similar to this used against one of my witnesses during trial when I was putting him on. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's lawyer took out the disclosure, showed it to him, and cross-examined him about what his opinions were going to be in the case.  And the judge allowed it to happen after the similar-type objections you're hearing today.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The Court's ruling on this will be that the Court feels that it is a proper form of impeachment, but shall not admit the disclosure of March 6th, 2015, in plaintiff's expert witness disclosure of March 6, 2015, and it's not to be directed at counsel.

So the way that you frame it, the question, I think, is going to need to be similar to what Mr. Bigger had indicated as a proper line of questioning as to the cross-examination.  All

right?

MR. BIGGER:  I understand, Your Honor.  Just to be clear that, I mean, depending upon the questions that are asked and the answers that are elicited, you may -- we may have to, on redirect, you know, pull out the disclosure and say, look you didn't draft this, we drafted this.  It says you were expected to.  It doesn't say you will or you're going to or here's what your opinions are, doesn't it?  I mean, that's just -- if they're going to open that door --

THE COURT:  I'll leave that to you.

MR. BIGGER:  -- that's what may happen after, but I think that the purpose should be first to avoid that, because I think that's a problem, and I think it creates unnecessary error to force us to have to essentially throw ourselves on the sword and say, look, we drafted this thing, it's not yours, it's our mistake.

THE COURT:  And, again, as long as it's framed correctly that the witness did not do the disclosure, okay, as to what -- and I don't know the exact quote.  I think maybe if we go back, as to the proper line of questioning associated with that..  I think that you understand what the

THE JURORS WHO RESPONDED:  Good morning. DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings. A.   Good morning. Q.   Welcome back. A.   Thanks.

Q. We're in the home stretch. I won't be much longer. But I would like to reorient the jury for a moment.

On Friday when we left off, the jury had saw the clip with Anne Browder from the Tobacco Institute discussing the industry's efforts to influence youth smoking.  We also saw the 1984 R.J. Reynolds' memo by Diane Burrows explaining why it's been so important for these defendants to get kids to start smoking.

At the same time that was taking place, was the defendants also publicly continuing the false controversy that they had started? A.   Yes.

Q.   And please explain who Ed Horrigan was. A.   Ed Horrigan was the CEO of R.J. Reynolds

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=462
1831

Tobacco Company.  He held various positions, but eventually became chairman of the company.

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  Please play PT01751A.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"Earlier this week, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company took out this ad in a number of major newspapers and magazines calling for an open debate about smoking.  In brief, the ad contends that medical studies which shown that cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring the significant evidence to the contrary.

Cigarette smoking does not cause cancer, yes or no?

It is not known whether cigarettes cause cancer or it has not been causally established.

Cigarette smoking, no causal relationship between cigarette smoking and emphysema?

Despite all of the research to date, there has been no causal link established?  No causal relationship between cigarette smoking and heart disease?

No.  As a matter of fact, there are studies that while we are accused of being associated with heart disease, there have been studies conducted

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=463
1832

over ten years that would say again that science

is still puzzled over these forces." (Video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   What year was that?

A.   That was 1984, part of the open debate campaign that Reynolds sponsored for two years in '84 and 1985.

Q.   And in 1984, when Mr. Horrigan made those statements on "Nightline," was there any debate within the industry itself as to whether or not there was a causal link between smoking and cancer?

A.   No, there was no debate.  That debate ended in the late 1950s, as we saw from the internal -- this is a document from the British scientists when they went around the country and they determined everybody, except for the doctors up at Yale, had pretty much come to the conclusion that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

Q.   Now, we saw evidence last week regarding the industry's refusal to cooperate closely with those tasks.  It was to safeguard the public's health.

Did the Surgeon General, nonetheless, finally conclude that nicotine in cigarettes was addictive?

A.   Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=464
1833

Q.   And when was that?

A.   That was 1988.

MR. CLARK:  And let's put up the slide

PDR140, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who is that gentleman depicted on the slide?

A.   That's Dr. C. Everett Koop.  He was the Surgeon General from 1982 until 1990.

Q.   And what we see on this slide is contained within this particular publication?

A.   Correct.  Those are the main conclusions from the 1988 report.

Q.   And if you could read those conclusions to the jury, please.

A.   Said, "After carefully examining the available evidence, this report concludes that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. And the pharmacological and -- or pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.

Q.   Now, was this another opportunity for the industry to come clean and agree with the Surgeon General's findings?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=465
1834

A.   Sure.

Q.   What did they choose to do? A.   They refuted this report.  They came out basically claiming that claims that cigarettes are addictive are irresponsible and, basically, went on to, for the next almost decade and, you know, few years, denying that their products were addictive.

Q.   Okay.  Let's go forward about six years to 1994.  I know this is a few years after the 1988 Surgeon General's report.

Did the executives of the cigarette industry, including these two defendants, testify before Congress?

A.   Yes, in April of 1994.

Q.   Let's see what they had to say about nicotine and addictiveness.

MR. CLARK:  PT1771, please. (Video played in open court as follows:) "I'll begin my question on the matter of whether or not nicotine is addictive.  Let me ask you first -- I would like to just go down the row -- whether each of you believes that nicotine is not addictive.  I heard virtually all of you touch on it.  Just yes or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=466
1835

I believe nicotine is not addictive, yes.

Mr. Johnson?

Congressmen, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction. There is no --

We'll take that as a no.  Again, time is short.  If you could just -- if you believe nicotine is not addictive, we would just like to have this for the record.

I don't believe that nicotine or our products are addictive.

I believe nicotine is not addictive.

I believe that nicotine is not addictive.

I believe that nicotine is not addictive.

And I too believe that nicotine is not addictive."

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   We saw the second gentleman that spoke in this picture, the second gentleman from the right was the chairman and CEO of R.J. Reynolds.

Who's the first gentleman that spoke? A.   That's Bill Campbell.  He was the president and CEO of Philip Morris at the time.

Q.   Now, just to be fair, is it conceivable that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=467
1836

the industry was confused as to the nature of their business and the crucial role of nicotine?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor,

argumentative.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  You

may proceed.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, to be fair, I have

researched this very carefully.  There was no

confusion.  They knew many decades earlier that

their products were addictive and they engineered

their products to make it hard to quit. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let's take a look at PT04791.  Are you familiar with this document?

A.   Sure.  This is a document authored by Dr. Claude Teague in the early '70s.  And he's basically in charge of new product development, and he's talking about the crucial role of nicotine in the design of cigarettes and talking about the research program that R.J. Reynolds needed to lay out to figure out what the minimum amount of nicotine was to have in their cigarettes to keep people smoking.

Q.   What year is this?

A.   This is 1972.

Q.   Let's take a look and see what he says.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=468
1837

It says "Memorandum.  In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly-ritualized, and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.  Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects."

What are physiological effects? A.   Well, that's the effect on the body physiologically.  Specifically, the brain. Q.   Is this a true statement? A.   Sure. Q.   Next section please, Baron.

"Thus, a tobacco product is, in essence, a vehicle for delivery of nicotine designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally-acceptable and attractive form.  Our industry is then based upon design, manufacture, and sale of attractive dosage forms of nicotine.  And our company's position in our industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or intangible, to the consumer than those of our competitors."

Is that true? A.   Yes, it is.

MR. CLARK:  Next page, please.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Happily, for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions.  Hence, no other active material or combination of materials provides equivalent satisfaction."

Based on your research of industry documents, did the industry use code words in the place of "nicotine" or "addiction"?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And what were some of those code words?

A.   Well, "satisfaction" was one that they often used when they talked about the effect, "kick." They're talking about the effect of nicotine.

"Compound W" was in some of the documents, was a code word for nicotine, so they wouldn't have "nicotine" showing up in their documents.

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Your turn to read.

A.   Sure.

"If nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco products and tobacco products are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is logical to design our products and, where possible, our

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=470
1839

advertising around the delivery of nicotine delivery rather than tar delivery or flavor.

Q.   Sine qua non is Latin for what?

A.   Well, it's the essential element, essentially is what it's saying.

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Before proceeding too far in the direction of design of dosage forms for nicotine, it may well be to consider another aspect of our business; that is, the factors which induce a presmoker or non-smoker to become a habituated smoker.  Confirmed smoker -- a confirmed smoker does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existing craving for nicotine.  Rather, he appears to start to smoke for purely psychological reasons to emulate a valued image, to conform, to experiment, to defy, to be daring, to have something to do with his hands and the like.

"Only after experiencing smoking for some period of time do the physiological satisfactions and habituation become apparent and needed.  Indeed, the first smoking experiences are often unpleasant until a tolerance for nicotine has been developed.  This leaves us then in the position of attempting to design and promote the same product to two different types of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=471
1840

market with two different sets of motivations, needs, and expectations."

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Your turn, Dr. Cummings.

A.   "On the other hand, if we are to attract the non-smoker or presmoker, there is nothing in this type of product that he would currently understand or desire.  We have deliberately played down the role of nicotine; hence, the non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no desire to try it.  Instead, we must -- somehow must convince him with wholly irrational reasons that should -- that he should try smoking in the hope that he will for himself then discover the real satisfactions obtainable."

Q.   Can you remind the jury what the age group is for those presmokers, non-smokers, learners?

A.   Yeah.  Most people start smoking in their teenage years.  Experimentation average age is 14. Becoming a regular daily smoker average age between 16 and 17.  So if you don't get them by essentially their teenage years, the business is lost and the companies -- you know, they talked about them as replacement smokers for those who quit and die.

MR. CLARK:  Next section, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "If, as proposed above, nicotine is the sine qua non of smoking and if we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward reduction or elimination of nicotine from our products, then we shall eventually liquidate our business."

And this document was written by who?

A.   Claude Teague.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, under the rule of

completeness, can we have the first three

sentences of that paragraph, please? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "But, again, the picture is not quite all that clear.  Critics of tobacco products increasingly allege that smoking is dangerous to the health of the smoker.  Part of this alleged danger is claimed to arise from ingestion of nicotine and part is claimed to arise from smoke components or smoke tar."

When this document was written, did the industry understand the danger of nicotine, or at least the significance of nicotine?

A.   Yes.  Nicotine is the indisputable link that keeps people smoking which gets them to be exposed to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=473
1842

the tar which causes the disease.  Without somebody being addicted, they don't get sick.

MR. CLARK:  PT 01552, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Before we get into this, let me ask you.  Was the ability to precisely control the nicotine level always within the control of the defendants, R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris? A.   Yes. Q.   Let's take a look at this document.

"Nicotine is by far the most characteristic single constituent in tobacco and the known physiological effects are positively correlated with smoker response."

We have a chart here.  Briefly, what is the information in the chart?

A.   Well, this is -- they're looking in 1963 at the nicotine levels by quarter dating back to 1960 up to the first quarter of 1963 where they're looking at nicotine levels of the different companies' brands.  So these are averaged.  And they're pointing out that --this is a Brown & Williamson document from Dr. Griffith, who was head of their research and development program.  It said, "Certainly our sales pattern during this period has been positively

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=474
1843

correlated with the nicotine level of the tobacco in our products."

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Certainly the nicotine level of B & W cigarettes" -- Brown & Williamson?

A.   Correct.

Q.   -- "given in the above table was not obtained by accident.  It may be well to remind you, however, that we have a research program in progress to obtain by genetic means any level of nicotine desired.  I think we can say even now that we can regulate fairly precisely the nicotine and sugar levels to almost any desired level management might require." Is that true?

A.   Yes, that was true.  And this is 1963.  So their ability to control the level of nicotine was very precise in their products.  They could do it through genetic engineering, cross-hybridization of the products, recon, I mentioned, as well as additives. They're mentioning sugar here as well because there's an interaction between sugar levels in the product and nicotine flavor.

Q.   This was September 18th, 1963.  How long before the Surgeon General's -- how long before the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=475
1844

report of the advisory committee of the Surgeon General came out?

A.   Well, that was 1988.  And �

Q.   I'm sorry.

A.   -- this one is 1963.  So it's just within a year of the Surgeon General's -- the first report comes out.

Q.   The 1964 report is the one I was referring to.

A.   Yep.

Q.   Did Brown & Williamson, now owned by R.J. Reynolds, provide that information to the Surgeon General's advisory committee in 1963?

A.   No.  It chose to withhold this.

Q.   Have you heard the phrase "sweet spot" used by members of the public health community to describe nicotine levels in cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What is meant by that phrase?

A.   Well, they're talking about the pH.  I think I described last week the pH level and how that's important to the ability to get the nicotine which comes in on the smoke particles inhaled into the airway.  If the pH is too high like a cigar, which is usually eight or above on the pH scale, it's too harsh

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=476
1845

and the smoke is mostly absorbed in the mouth, not into the airways.  If it's too low, too acidic, similar kind of thing.  So you had to hit the sweet spot, which is just slightly above six on the pH scale for cigarette smoke.  And they do that with a variety of means, including the use of various additives that are put in the product.

Q.   If the industry allowed the -- strike that. How does -- how -- can you explain how the inhalability of the cigarette smoke is affected if the nicotine level is too high?

A.   Well, if the nicotine -- nicotine is actually an irritant.  And if the nicotine level is too high, it will be irritating and will be rejected.  If it's too low, smokers will also freely be able to stop smoking. So the nicotine -- the delivery is key.  You've got to get it into the airway.  So the mode of delivery is really key.  So a nicotine patch, two hours, you know, getting the nicotine through the skin to have any effect actually on the central nervous system.  Chewing gum or a lozenge where you hold the product in your mouth, you're absorbing it through the lining of the mouth, you're talking 20 or 30 minutes.  Put it into your lungs, a huge surface area, seven to 10 seconds it hits the brain.  That's why you get satisfaction and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=477
1846

people get pleasure and it's why they find it hard to stop, because you don't feel normal when you're not getting that nicotine hit.  And people develop their own tolerance, how much nicotine they're going to need There's individual variability, but they put 20 cigarettes in a pack because that's the typical amount that the average smoker needs to keep themselves fed with nicotine on a daily basis.

Q.   Does the level of nicotine affect a smoker's free choice to smoke or not?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And did the industry, including these two defendants, ever tell the American public during the life of John Barbose that they were designing their cigarettes in a way to deprive smokers of their complete free choice?

A.   John Barbose and members of the public health community were kept in the dark, as -- and still are, by the way, as to how the products are engineered to deliver nicotine.  So the formulas for brands like Marlboro and Winston, Camel, Lucky Strike, which have been modified over time -- we know that because we can look at the back engineering of the products from the internal documents.  The actual formulas have been concealed from the American public.  They have no clue

Q.   And let's talk briefly about some of the tobacco that those figures like Mark Twain you referred to and the tobacco referred to in the 1906 Florida Health Notes.

What is the difference between the tobacco referred to there and the Lucky Strikes, the Philip Morris, the Marlboros, the Marlboro Lights, the Camels, and the Winstons that John Barbose smoked?

A.   Well, the Florida Health Notes was really talking about taking scraps of discarded tobacco, squids of tobacco I think is referred to, which is chewing tobacco that people spit out.  And they were taking that material and rolling it in paper, often laced with other drugs at the time.  I think they were talking about the opium dens in San Francisco with that part of Health Notes.  So it was very unhealthy and unsanitary and disgusting.  And that's what the comment from the Florida Health Notes were all about.

That's quite different than the American blended cigarette that, you know, first appeared in 1913 with Camel and then was perfected over the decades and still is being perfected to this day to make it hard to quit.

Q.   Despite all that, have you seen internal documents from the industry acknowledging that smokers

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1849

lacked vital information about nicotine? A.   Sure.

MR. CLARK:  Let's go to PT 2077. BY MR. CLARK:

Q. This is 1978, August 24th, 1978. "Very few consumers are aware of the effect of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison."

Can you please tell the jury who those individuals are?

A.   Well, Mr. Steele and Mr. McClure � Mr. McCue, I guess it is, both worked in marketing at Brown & Williamson, and they were doing their own consumer studies.  And there are many consumer studies that have been done at this time period that show that the American consumer is not well informed about nicotine addiction.  And they're not very well informed even in the early 1980s about the health risks of smoking. Most people sort of have heard about the dangers.  They know there is something out there, but they don't know precisely what that is.  And they underestimate it, particularly if they're an addicted smoker.  And most people basically have the view it will never happen to me, even though one in two smokers dies prematurely as a result.

strike.  The question was who are these gentlemen. THE COURT:  I'll sustain the objection and

grant the motion to strike.

Please be responsive to the questions being

posed. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, can you please explain historically what the industry knew regarding the truth about nicotine as compared to what the public knew?

A.   Sure.  Just as I had indicated, the American consumer was in the dark about nicotine as addiction; most viewed it as a habit.  In fact, there are polls that were done at this time into the early '80s that confirm that.

MR. CLARK:  Let's look at another document.

PT 3291, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Implications and activities arising from correlation of smoke pH with nicotine impact other smoke qualities and cigarette sales." This is a secret?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Or at least stamped "secret"?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Your turn to read.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=482
1851

A.   Sure.  "All evidence indicates that the relatively high smoke pH, high alkalinity, shown by Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands and Kool is deliberate and controlled.  This has raised questions as to, one, the effect of higher smoke pH on nicotine impact and smoke quality and some market performance; and, two, how the higher smoke pH might be accomplished."

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Smoke pH and free nicotine.  In essence, a cigarette is a system for delivery of nicotine to the smoker in attractive useful form.  At normal smoke pH, at or below about 6.0, essentially all of the smoke nicotine is chemically combined with acidic substances; hence, is non-volatile and relatively slowly absorbed by the smoker.  As the smoke pH increases above about 6.0, an increasing proportion of the total smoke nicotine occurs in free form, which is volatile, rapidly absorbed by the smoker, and believed to be instantaneously -- instantly perceived as nicotine kick.  Chart 8 shows how proportion of free nicotine increases as pH goes higher.  Marlboro and Kool deliver about the same amounts of total smoke nicotine as do our comparable brands, charts 9 and 10.  However,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=483
1852

Marlboro smoke is typically at pH 6.8 to 7.3, and Kool smoke is typically at 6.4 to 6.6, as compared with Winston smoke at pH 5.8 to 6.0 and Salem smoke at pH 6.0 to 6.2.  Thus, Marlboro and Kool smokes contain more free nicotine than our comparable brands, hence, would be expected to show more instantaneous nicotine kick than our brands.  Charts 11 and 12 show these relationships along with some comparative sales data to be discussed later."

Historically, what was the sales positions of Marlboro and Winston when this document was written?

A.   Well, Marlboro was increasing.  Marlboro did things to alter the pH of their cigarettes in the early 1960s and their sales took off.  Kool did the same. And Winston, which had been the market leader in the '60s, was starting in the early '70s to lose sales relative to Marlboro.

Q.   Let me ask you -- let's go to the next section real quick.

Before we read that, what was the date of that document?

A.   1973.

Q.   And based on the materials you read, what brand was John Barbose smoking in the 1970s?

A.   Marlboro.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=484
1853

Q.   "Methods which may be used to increase smoke pH and/or nicotine kick include:  One, increasing the amount of strong burley in the blend; two, reduction of casing sugar used on the burley and/or blend; three, use of alkaline additives, usually ammonia compounds, to the blend; four, addition of nicotine to the blend; five, removal of acids from the blend; six, special filter systems to remove acids from or add alkaline materials to the smoke; and, seven, use of high air dilution filter systems.  Methods one through three in combination represent the Philip Morris approach and are under active investigation.  The remaining methods appear less attractive or less practical and are currently receiving less attention."

Was this information known to cigarette smokers including John Barbose?

A.   No, it was not known that Marlboro had been manipulated in a way that affected smoke pH to give it more kick and therefore hold smokers in being more addictive.  Neither was it known later that R.J. Reynolds did this.  The Camel reformulation I talked about in 1974, the Meet the Turk campaign, new Camel version, that was adopting the same methods that Philip Morris had used for Marlboro.  And later Winston added ammonia to its cigarettes in 1979.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=485
1854

The consumer was never told about those changes.  These products were manipulated and revised and sold in the same box.  The consumer thought they were getting the same product, but they were being manipulated in ways to make it hard to quit.

Q.   I want to show you real quick -- or show the jury real quick a video of Marlboro Lights.  Are you familiar with this video? A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Okay.  PT 4581 A.

(A video was played to the jury.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And there's no sound.  Can you please explain what we see.

A.   Sure.  We're seeing the ground up recon tobacco.  That's the rich brown liquor that I talked about.  That's the extracted nicotine and coloring agent in the recon that they're taking out.  This is at the Philip Morris plant in Richmond.  This is one of the vats of material you're seeing that they have.

Here is diammonium phosphate.  That's DAP. So that's an ammonia-based compound added to the reconstituted or man-made tobacco to affect the delivery of nicotine, to give it more kick.

This is another vat.  This one is urea.  Urea

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=486
1855

is another additive that's used in tobacco products to affect the pH of the smoke.

This is the sheet, as you can see, coming off -- it's all high-speed, all automated.  Very few people running this plant.  It's all automated.  And you can see the recon sheet here coming off the rollers, being dipped in the brown liquor.  So that's the reapplying.

And now they're shredding it.  And it goes on a conveyor belt into their cigarette-making machinery. That's the rolls of different tobacco blends that they have, and this is the cigarettes.  And they're pumping them out at a very high rate of speed, 24/7. (The video was concluded.) MR. CLARK:  PT 1820, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Now, while this is coming up, did R.J. Reynolds recognize that the viability of their business depended on smokers remaining addicted?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And is that discussed in this document referred to as the Nordine study?

A.   It is.

Q.   Historically, can you tell us what the Nordine study was?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=487
1856

A.   Richard Nordine was in the marketing department at R.J. Reynolds, had undertaken a large study in the early 1980s to look at the dynamics of the cigarette market and how they needed -- what they needed to do to be profitable going forward.  And this is a memo from Claude Teague to Dr. DiMarco.  I think we saw a document referring to Dr. DiMarco who had been interviewed by the legal department at Reynolds last week.  Anyway, he's now vice president of R&D in Reynolds in 1982, so a high level document.  And Dr. Teague is summarizing the implications of the Nordine study to the business of R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   Let me read this.  "Most of those who have smoked for any significant time would like to stop. Many, but not most of those who would like to stop smoking, are able to do so."

Based on your review of the case materials regarding John Barbose, does he fit within these two statements?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How so?

A.   Well, tried to stop smoking and was not able to do so.  So -- and, you know, he was a long-time smoker.  And certainly beginning in the 1980s and early in the 1990s, he was making efforts to try to stop

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=488
1857

without success.

MR. CLARK:  Page 2, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "We should be able to maintain/increase the size of the total market by influencing entry/exit rates."

What is the entry into the cigarette market?

A.   Right.  The entry is primarily non-smokers, mainly teenagers who are smoking.  So they're looking at the dynamics of the market.  And the dynamics, or total sales, are influenced by how many replacement smokers you can bring in versus how many you can either hold in the market or how many quit or die and leave the market.  So he's talking about these dynamic forces and how to affect that.

Q.   "However, we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could; that is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of business almost overnight."

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Now, Dr. Teague, does he make some recommendations here?

A.   Well, he comments above about the slow

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=489
1858

progress that had been made in developing aids to help people quit, because most people would quit if they could.  And he's basically pointing out what would happen if people actually had an exit gate to get out of the market.  He said, "If that were to occur -- if and when that occurs, our options include:  No. 1, go out of business; No. 2, find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop; and, No. 3, provide other products away from conventional cigarettes which meet the same needs cigarettes now meet but without the associated negatives."

Q.   How out of those three options indicated by Dr. Teague, what has your research shown you about which option these defendants focus most of their time and effort into?

A.   My research actually points out option one was not an option for the industry.  So they had no plans of ever going out of business.  So option two is really where they have focused their attention from the early '80s really even until this day, because that's where they put their energy, time, and money is to figure out how to keep people addicted to cigarettes so it's not easy for them to walk away, because most of their customers would leave them if they could.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "We cannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could."

And that's by Claude Teague?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, along the same lines of No. 2, option No. 2 that Dr. Teague talked about, find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking, roughly around this time, have you seen documents that reflect Philip Morris's attempt to interfere with the success of Nicorette gum?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, they'll be in evidence.  I'm not going to show them for time purposes.  But I would like you to briefly explain what those efforts were by Philip Morris.

A.   Sure.  Nicotine gum had been introduced in Europe as a prescription product in 1982.  In 1984, it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be sold in the United States as a prescription.  You had to go to a doctor to get them to write a prescription for you.  And in 1984, it turned out that Marion Merrell Dow of Dow Chemical was the distributor for Nicorette gum at that time.  And Philip Morris

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=491
1860

essentially -- well, they were buying chemicals used in the manufacture of cigarettes from Dow Chemical. Propylene glycol, which is the chemical that makes it easier to inhale cigarette smoke, and glycerin were both purchased by Philip Morris from Dow.

And so there are correspondence going back and forth between Dow and Philip Morris over the marketing of Nicorette.  And they got Dow to really ratchet back some of the things they were doing, like sending a newsletter to doctors to talk about nicotine addiction, for example.  There was one issue of that newsletter co-published between the National Cancer Institute and Dow Chemical introducing the idea that cigarette smoking is addictive.  Philip Morris didn't like that, and they never published another newsletter. There was a whole series that was supposed to go out to doctors.

They got them to ratchet down on their advertising, stop funding various groups that were looking into the cost of smoking to insurance companies.  So they suspended Dow sales of the glycerin.  By the way, that was the threat that they had.  And then in 19- -- late 1984, early '85, they reinstituted their sales, because there were only two suppliers.  So it was actually costing Philip Morris

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=492
1861

money when you only have one to buy from.  And also they had continued to exert control over the marketing of Nicorette.

So they dampened down -- we never knew this until the documents became available in 2000 that Philip Morris was a bully.

Q.   All right.  Let's kind of bring all this home.  The jury has seen the evidence about nicotine manipulation, control of nicotine delivery, the importance of nicotine in the cigarette industry's business model.  With that thought in mind, did you review all the evidence gathered in this case regarding John Barbose with an effort to determine whether or not John Barbose was addicted to smoking the cigarettes manufactured by these two defendants?

A.   Yes.  I reviewed the evidence as to whether he was addicted to their cigarettes.

Q.   And what have you determined based on that review?

A.   There's no doubt in my mind that he was an addicted smoker, he was addicted to the defendant's brands, and that he was not aware of the formulas and the way the companies manipulated the brands that he smoked.

Q.   Let me stop you there.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=493
1862

A.   Sure.

Q.   To be sure, was he addicted to brands manufactured by R.J. Reynolds?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was he addicted to brands manufactured by Philip Morris?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   Now, likewise, has the Surgeon General recently spoken to the fundamental reason that most smokers smoke cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's go to the 2010 Surgeon General's report.  And this is the 2010 report?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report." Is that true?

A.   That's true.

Q.   "Tobacco addiction remains a substantial problem in the United States and worldwide.  Of those individuals who have ever tried smoking, about one-third become daily smokers.  Of those smokers who try to quit, less than five percent are successful at

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=494
1863

any one time.  Although not all smokers become nicotine dependent, the prevalence of individuals diagnosed as nicotine dependent is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder.  Any efforts to reduce tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction potential of a tobacco product."

Let me read this, and then I have a question for you.

"Definition of nicotine addiction.  Primary criteria:  Highly controlled or compulsive use, psychoactive effects, drug reinforced behavior. Additional criteria:  Addictive behavior often involves stereotypic patterns of use, use despite harmful effects, relapse following abstinence, recurrent drug cravings."

Does the Surgeon General -- is that the Surgeon General's definition of addiction?

A.   In the '88 report, that's what they used, yes .

Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not John Barbose met the Surgeon General's definition of addiction when he was a smoker?

A.   Yes, he did.  I do have an opinion.

Q.   What is that opinion?

A.   He did.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=495
1864

Q.   Now, many years before the 2010 report, did the Surgeon General also speak to this issue in the 1989 Surgeon General's report?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, before we leave the

report, may we have the paragraph immediately

preceding the criteria published? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "The crux of the understanding the pathophysiology of tobacco addiction and its measurement relies on the identification of critical characteristics and the definition of addiction.  This area continues to evolve and significant gaps in research are evident.  There is no established consensus on criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction; however, researchers have identified several symptoms as indicators of addiction.  The 1988 Surgeon General's report lists the following general criteria for drug dependence, including nicotine dependence." Is that what you just read?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  All right.  Going back to the 1989 Surgeon General's report.

MR. CLARK:  That's PT 3829, please.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=496
1865

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Under the heading, "Children and Adolescents: Two additional factors makes smoking among young people a preeminent health concern.  One, the age of initiation of smoking; and, two, nicotine addiction. As this report shows, four-fifths of smokers born since 1935 started smoking before age 21.  These two factors refute the argument that smoking is a matter of free choice.  Most smokers start smoking as teenagers and then become addicted.  By the time smokers become adults, when they would be expected to have greater appreciation of the health effects of smoking, many have difficulty quitting."

Does that statement fit John Barbose?

A.   It does.

Q.   Now, are you familiar with a document put out by Philip Morris titled "Raising Kids Who Don't Smoke"?

A.   Yes.  2003, I believe, it was published. MR. CLARK:  PT 00425. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   In this document, does Philip Morris list ways to determine if someone is addicted?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's take a look at what Philip Morris has to say.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=497
1866

A.   It has criteria for determining whether somebody is addicted.

Q.   Thank you for correcting me.

"If your child already smokes:  Take a deep breath.  Now ask your child about his smoking.  How long has he been smoking?  Why?  There is a chance that if your child has been smoking for a while, he may be addicted.  Ask about some of the symptoms of nicotine addiction.  Have you tried to quit but couldn't?  Do you ever have strong cravings to smoke?  Do you have trouble concentrating or feel cranky, restless, nervous, or anxious when you can't smoke?  Have you tried to go without smoking but failed?  If your child answers yes to any of these questions, he may be addicted."

Based on Philip Morris's criteria, do you have an opinion as to whether or not John Barbose met their criteria and was addicted?

A.   Yes.  John Barbose would meet Philip Morris's criteria as being addicted.

Q.   The jury was shown a couple of slides in opening statements on Thursday, and I want to show them to you just for a second, please.

MR. CLARK:  This is ODEM10 and 0DEM11. BY MR. CLARK:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1867

Q.   Do you recognize that gentleman in the picture?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Okay.  It says, "Anyone can quit if they make up their mind to do it."

Is there more to that statement to put it in context, please?

A.   Yeah.  That's taken out of context.  What I'm really saying is -- and I certainly tell people, You've got to make up your mind to make a quit attempt.  And then I tell the smokers that I treat that it's not going to be an easy road, not to get discouraged because most people who quit are going to end up relapsing back to smoking.

So the rest of the story is, anyone can quit, but most people find it very hard to stay off of the cigarettes because of the way they're engineered by the cigarette companies.

MR. CLARK:  The other slide, please, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "The success rate for people who really want to quit and stick to it is 100 percent." Also, in the same context?

A.   Yeah.  They're taking out of context a statement that's made in a self-help guide that I wrote

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=499
1868

called Smart Move that was trying to motivate smokers to make a quit attempt.  And we had a readiness test that said, Are you motivated?  Are you willing to make changes?  Are you willing to tough it out?  If you answer yes to that, you're ready to make a quit attempt.  It doesn't mean that you're going to be successful in staying off, because we know the reality of nicotine addiction is out of a hundred people who make that quit attempt, only about three to five percent are going to be successful in staying off long-term, that is, six months or longer.

Q.   If three to five percent stay off cigarettes for the long-term, would you ever tell smokers who come to you for help that they have a 95 to 97 percent chance of failure?

A.   No.  I mean, obviously we're trying to motivate people.  We're glad they're there to make a quit attempt.  We're going to do what we can to maximize the success of that.  But I also give them the reality if they slip, as most will.  And if you look at the guide, we even say, If you have a slip, don't get discouraged.  Pick yourself back up, keep going forward.  So, I mean, that's the reality of what you're doing.  It's like, you know, a cancer doctor is not going to tell a patient there's no hope.  The same is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=500
1869

true with dealing with addiction.  Addiction is lifelong.  You have permanent changes to your brain. And it's a day at a time.  You know, you try to have more days of remission than relapse.

Q.   I want to go back to a couple of documents before we get too far.

Have you seen documents where the industry compared smokers like John Barbose to rats in a cage?

A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Let's take a look at PT 01809. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   What company wrote this document?

A.   This is Philip Morris.

Q.   "Smoker Psychology Program Review.  First, every undertaking has to have some mission.  I would state our charter from Philip Morris in this fashion. Study the psychology of the smoker in search of information that can increase corporate profits."

MR. CLARK:  Next section, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "There are some distinctive features about the cigarette market.  We sell a product that is bought often and used from 10 to 60 times a day, day in, day out.  We provide a product that is the essential commodity in a habitual act.  You are all familiar with

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=501
1870

Pavlov's dog.  Presented dog food, he salivates.  Ring a bell each time you present the food and, in due time, you can ring the bell without the food and he will salivate.  This is classic conditioning."

MR. CLARK:  Gotta keep up with me, Baron. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   "Put a hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage, make it so that a push on the lever delivers a pellet of food.  In its random movements, the rat will push the lever; he'll get the pellet.  The rat will soon associate lever-pushing with the food pellet. In time, he will be rapidly pushing the lever for food.

Consider the smoker.  Smoking the cigarette is the lever press.  The effect of that smoking act upon his person is the reward.  That effect reinforces the smoking act.  He comes to push the lever 10 to 60 times per day.  Our task is to understand the reinforcing mechanism or process whereby the habit is established and maintained.  Such is our model conceptually simple on the surface.  Let the complexities lurk in numbers beneath the surface."

Please read that last statement, please. A.   "Without the chemical compound, the cigarette market would collapse, PM would collapse, and we'd all lose our jobs and consulting fees."

He's talking below about nicotine is the chemical compound.

Q.   What is the chemical compound?

A.   It's nicotine.

Q.   Have these two defendants ever publicly admitted that addiction to nicotine causes lung cancer and death?

A.   No, they've never done that.

Q. Has the Surgeon General nonetheless expressly stated that?

A.   Yeah.  It's very clear that the people who get sick from smoking are those who are addicted.

Q.   Let's take a look at the 2004 Surgeon General's report.  Is there a chart in here that's helpful for you to show the jury your testimony?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Okay.  Let's take a look at that. MR. CLARK:  This is PT 3833 B. BY MR. CLARK:

Q. There's some technical terms in here. If you could please explain, Dr. Cummings, what this chart is showing us.

A.   It's just a diagram showing that, you know, you get addicted to nicotine.  That's the beginning part there.  That's what causes the repeated exposure

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=503
1872

to the carcinogens.  PAH is polyaromatic hydrocarbons, that class of chemicals that Dr. Rodgman was talking in the '50s.  NNK is a particular type of chemical, a tobacco-specific nitrosamine that is a very potent lung carcinogen.

Generally the body, when it's exposed, will de- -- through metabolic means will detoxify the body of these exposures and you excrete them.  But in some instances, you begin to overwhelm the body's repair mechanism to detoxify and it causes DNA damage.  And the body repairs the DNA damage.  Every time you puff on a cigarette, essentially you're doing damage to the cells.  You have repair.  You get normal DNA.

Again, in the person who has been a long-term smoker because of nicotine addiction, they overwhelm that repair mechanism and they go on and have miscoding of their cells.  And, you know, basically when you have cancer cells and they start growing uncontrollably, they begin to take over an organ.  And then you get the mutations that are indicated.  These are the mutations you see in lung cancer, the predominant ones.  And so they're the signature for what eventually becomes a tumor that's found in somebody's lung.  And usually it's found too late, and people with lung cancer don't live very long, unfortunately.

Q.   When the 2004 Surgeon General's report was released, which this was a part of, was that yet another opportunity for the industry to tell the truth and agree?

A.   Yes.  Yes.

Q.   Now, in 1994, we saw the executives that stood up before Congress and testified under oath that they did not believe that nicotine was addictive.  Were they also asked questions at the same hearing regarding the relationship between smoking and lung cancer? A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's see what they said. MR. CLARK:  PT 38 62 A.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"Do you or do you not agree with the Surgeon General's estimate of over 400,000 smokers die each year?

I do not agree.

Okay.  Do you know how many die each year? I do not know."

MR. CLARK:  Pause that for a second. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Who is that again?

A.   That's Mr. Johnston from R.J. Reynolds.  He's

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=505
1874

the present CEO of R.J. Reynolds.

MR. CLARK:  Please continue.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"They agree that smoking causes lung cancer. Do you agree?

It may.

Do you know whether it does?

I do not.

The medical experts agree that smoking causes emphysema.  Do you agree?

If they're saying.

They agree that smoking causes bladder cancer, stroke, and low birth weight.  Do you agree?

It may.

Mr. Tisch, I want to move to you for a moment.  In a deposition last year, you were asked whether cigarette smoking causes cancer.  Your answer was, quote, 'I don't believe so.'

Do you stand by that answer today?

I do, sir.

Do you understand how isolated you are in that belief from the entire scientific community?

I do, sir.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1875

You're the head of a manufacturer of a product that's been accused by the overwhelming scientific community to cause cancer.  You don't know?  Do you have an interest in finding out?

I do, sir, yes.

And what have you done to pursue that interest?

Well, we -- we have looked at the data.  The data that we have been able to see has all been statistical data that has not convinced me that smoking causes death.

Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed and you said, quote, 'To my knowledge, it has not been proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer.'

This is a rather passive and puzzling approach, especially in light of the consensus not by some, but all of the scientific community. Will you ever be convinced?  And what evidence are you waiting for?

Let's have the microphone passed over.

Yes, I may be convinced.  We don't know what causes cancer in general right now.  So I think that we may find out what causes cancer and we may find out some relationship which has yet to be proven."

Q.   How long before John Barbose died were these statements being made to Congress?

A.   Just two years.

Q

truth? A Q

Was this another opportunity to tell the

Yes

Based on your research of industry documents, did these defendants and -- or do you have an opinion -- sorry -- let me start over with that question.

Based on your research and study of the industry and these defendants in particular, do you have an opinion as to whether or not they intended for John Barbose and others like him to rely upon their fraudulent concealment and conspiracy? A.   Yes, I do. Q.   What is that opinion? A.   They did.

MR. CARTER:  Objection, cumulative of findings.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

You may answer the question.

MR. CLARK:  I'm sorry, sir.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=508
1877

THE WITNESS:  Yes, they did.  That was why

they created the false controversy.  They expected

smokers to rely on that information. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And based upon all the information you reviewed, particularly as it relates to John Barbose, do you have an opinion as to whether or not John Barbose did rely upon the campaign to fraudulently conceal and the conspiracy to fraudulently conceal?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what is that opinion?

A.   Based on my review of the testimony in this case, I think his daughter said he expected the tobacco companies to be truthful.  So there's evidence that he relied on the information he was getting.  He relied on the filters and commented about the safety of Marlboro Light filters and so on when he switched to that brand.

Q.   Let me talk to you real briefly about the warnings that went on the pack, because the jury was told during opening statements that every time John Barbose bought a pack, he bought a warning.  And what I want to ask you is, are you familiar with the statement -- and I believe we already saw Mr. Robert Heimann.

Are you familiar with statements regarding

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=509
1878

the industry's position on the warnings as they appeared on the cigarette packs in the mid 1980s? A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Let's play that clip.

(A video clip was played to the jury in open court.)

"I want to show you what's marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 17, which is simply a package of Pall Mall cigarettes currently being sold.  Can you identify that as a package of Pall Malls?

Yes, sir.

And would you read the warning that's placed on that for us, please?

Surgeon General's warning:  Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.

That is not a warning that is voluntarily placed there by American Tobacco, is it?

No, it is not.

Would you put that warning there if Congress didn't required it?

I wouldn't.

And the reason is simply American disagrees with the warning, doesn't it?

We certainly do.

You don't think they harm smokers.  So

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=510
1879

there's no reason to put any warning on, do you?

We believe our product is not injurious to health.

As far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

I would use the term misguided.

And if he's misguided, then, I take it that your opinion is he's wrong?

I was simply trying to be polite about it.

Okay.  But not being polite about it, in your opinion, he's wrong, correct?

Dead wrong.

Congress is wrong requiring , correct?

We do not think they're justified.

So they're wrong?

They're wrong."

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Getting close here.  I'm going to ask you this.  As a consequence of these defendants' actions over the majority of the 20th century in an effort to increase corporate profits, how many Americans are killed each year by cigarettes?

A.   About half a million Americans die every year

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=511
1880

from smoking.

Q.   Has the Surgeon General recently calculated the total preventable loss of American lives due to cigarette-related diseases over the last 50 years?

A.   Yes.

Q.   That's the 2014 Surgeon General's report.

MR. CLARK:  This is PTSG 2014.  Let's take a

look at that, please. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   The major conclusions, "The century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an enormous avoidable public health tragedy.  Since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964, more than 20 million premature deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.  The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately misled the public on the risks of smoking cigarettes."

That was the conclusion in 2014 by the Surgeon General?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Got one more document to take a look at here, Dr. Cummings.  I'm sorry.  Before I get to that document, let me ask you this.

Has the tobacco industry ever acknowledged

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=512
1881

that their cigarettes have killed 20 million people, 20 million Americans?

A.   No.

Q.   For the last 35 years, has the industry itself internally recognized the effect that nicotine addiction has on a smoker's free choice?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, asked and

answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

MR. CLARK:  Let's take a look at PT 2184. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   The date of this is September 9, 1980.  Who was Mr. Kloepfer and Mr. Knopik?

A.   Mr. Kloepfer was vice president in charge of public relations for the Tobacco Institute, essentially second in command.  And Mr. Knopik was the editor of a publication, Tobacco Observer, which was one of the publications of the Tobacco Institute that they would put out.  And he would keep track of developments in the scientific area.  And he's commenting on some comments that were made by the then director of the National Institutes on Drug Abuse talking about cigarette smoking and nicotine addiction.

Q.   Let's see what they had to say.

"But I don't think" -- he asked some

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=513
1882

questions in this document.

"But I don't think the questions I now raise are academic.  Our lawyers remind us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer case -- in a lung cancer cigarette case.  We can't defend continued smoking as free choice if the person was addicted."

True? A.   That's true.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we've talked a lot about a lot of topics.  I'm going to put up a slide here for you real quick.  Talked about a lot of topics over the last couple of days, so I want to run through them real quick.

We talked about marketing to children, concealment of the health effects of smoking cigarettes manufacture �

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we approach? I'm sorry to interrupt.

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. CARTER:  Take the demonstrative down, please.

(At sidebar.)

MR. CARTER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We have an

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=514
1883

objection.  I think this violates the findings and mandate of Engle.  One of the demonstrative bullet points -- I believe it was the second from the bottom -- said "filter fraud and reliance." Obviously, as Your Honor has instructed this jury, the findings state what they expressly state and only that.  The jury is not allowed to speculate as to what goes behind them.  And so I think trying to link up filter fraud as a specific part of the Engle finding violates the mandate of Engle, and so we object.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, I have an additional objection to make that it's cumulative and it's a summation of his testimony.  That's closing argument.  You don't get to just rehash the subject.  Cumulative, asked and answered.

MR. CLARK:  Number one, to address the last point, I'm not going to rehash his testimony.  I'm reorienting the jury to what the testimony has been, just the topics.  I'm not going to ask him what his opinions are regarding those.  Again, we're not going to rehash that.

Second of all, this slide has nothing to do with the Engle findings.  Dr. Cummings has talked about the illusion of filtration and how that was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=515
1884

a fraudulent scheme.  That was a psychological crutch to continue smoking.  This has nothing to do with the findings, in no way undermines the findings, in no way relitigates the findings.  All it's going to do is reorient the jury to what topics he covered.  And then I'm going to ask the question about it.

THE COURT:  Is this your summary as to your last question?

MR. CLARK:  Yes.  This is my last question. THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection.  We're not going to go through each element again or go through each opinion again.

MR. CLARK:  No, sir.  We'll go right to the point.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you. (End of sidebar.) BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   To start back over, so these are the topics that we've covered over the past couple of days.  We talked about the industry's marketing to children, concealment of the health effects of smoking cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, conspiracy to conceal the health effects of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine, filter fraud and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=516
1885

reliance on companies' concealment of the lack of any benefit by switching to lights, nicotine manipulation to create and sustain addiction.

What I want to ask you, sir, is, we spent all this time talking about it and the jury was asked the question, What does this have to do with John Barbose? So I'm asking you, What does this have to do with John Barbose?

A.   Sure.  It has everything to do with John Barbose.  He was, you know, affected by the marketing.  He grew up in an era where smoking was a rite of passage and made that way by the marketing of tobacco products to young people and then to adults as a normal part of Americana.  And he smoked the most popular brands of cigarettes, so the most heavily advertised that the companies would expect based on their sales.  Their advertising directly relates to that.

He was affected because he began smoking in the early '50s and continued to smoke essentially right up to the time that he passed away by the concealment of the health information, essentially what I call the 50-year coverup that was orchestrated by the defendants in this case, R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, and other cigarette companies, where they spent over a billion

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=517
1886

dollars over that 45-year period to basically lie about what they knew about the health risks of smoking, so not giving the smokers the benefit of the doubt had there been no controversy.  John Barbose was an intelligent person.  He would at least have had the information at that point that was withheld from him.

They concealed the health effects of smoking and addiction, specifically that nicotine addiction. They knew it was going to hold him in to the smoking pattern once he got started smoking as a teenager and it would make it hard for him to quit.  And they engineered their products in ways that basically held John Barbose in the market.  He tried to quit and he failed, as they expected him to fail.  It was by design, not an accident, not a personality flaw or character flaw of John Barbose.  It was the design and deliberate effort of the defendants.

The filter fraud and light fraud, I mean, that was just another way of giving people an excuse, an exit ramp to keep smoking, that No. 2, you know, we've got to hold smokers in.  So if you've having a tough time getting off of the cigarettes, you know, we'll just make you a product that gives you the perception that it's lower in risk when, in fact, the design changes that went into those products, the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=518
1887

addition of filters which makes it easier to draw the smoke deeper into the lungs where you see it more in the peripheral part of the lung where you see most of the adenocarcinomas these days, directly a result of the companies' -- the companies knew there was no benefit to filters and lights.

And then nicotine manipulation, I've talked about that in terms of the design of the product.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I want you to assume for the purpose of this question that there's evidence in the medical records that the jury will see and hear, testimony that John Barbose died of lung cancer. Did John Barbose -- assuming that, did John Barbose become one of the 20 million people --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- who died from smoking?

A.   Yes.  John Barbose was one of those statistics.

MR. CLARK:  Thank you, sir.  I don't have any

further questions, but I believe the lawyers for

R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris probably have some

for you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

I think we'll take this opportunity to take a

break, unless there's objection of counsel?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

MR. CARTER:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll take 15 minutes, until 10:30, ladies and gentlemen, for you to stretch your legs and use the facilities or anything else that you need.  You may stand down until then and you'll have the same instructions as always during the recess not to talk amongst yourselves or do any investigation or listen to anything about this trial.

Counsel, were you able to find anything about the 2013 �

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, may the witness step down?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. BIGGER:  Use the restroom or whatever.

THE COURT:  2013 website I think we were looking at?

MR. THORNE:  Yes, Your Honor.  May I approach?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=520
1889

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. THORNE:  Here's what I know, Your Honor. And I can show you a PDF on my phone because I don't have the document with me.  But the document as presented to us on the plaintiff's exhibit list did not have the words "Philip Morris USA" at the top.  I'm not sure where that came from, but it's not on the version that we had.

I had somebody do a search for the exhibit itself, because this exhibit number is consistent with exhibit numbers we've had in lots of other cases.  This exhibit has never been admitted into a Philip Morris case that we can find.  So the document itself on its face is not the same as what we were produced.  I don't have any evidence it's ever been admitted into a case.  It may be a document that's a link to findings by the FDA without the title of Philip Morris USA at the top. But at this point, I don't have any way of verifying that at this time.

THE COURT:  Counsel, I'm a little confused, I guess.

MR. BIGGER:  Sure.  And I apologize, Your Honor.  My understanding -- and I'll confirm this with my side.  But my understanding, this was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=521
1890

a page that was on Philip Morris USA's website.  I think it was up until a few months ago, as I understand.  There was some maintenance that was done by Philip Morris on their website and, after that maintenance, this was removed.  So I don't believe it's on the website currently.

But obviously we have told counsel this, that historical versions of the website may be used at different times.  And I think their position is the same, that they may use either their current or historical versions of their website as needed.

I'm not familiar with Mr. Thome's question about Philip Morris USA.  I'll confirm that and find out, if I can just have a moment.

MR. THORNE:  Here's the PDF that my office sent me of what the document looks like that was produced to us in the exhibits.

THE COURT:  If that's the case, do you have any objection to removing the Philip Morris USA title?

MR. BIGGER:  No.  If that's the case, that's fine .

That's how it was printed. It looks like this is a slide. I think this is a slide that maybe was used in opening or in some fashion.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=522
1891

But, you know, you can see the blue border around it.  I think it's perhaps from a slide, a demonstrative that was made from those findings. My understanding from the person who created the document is that that's how it prints out from the website with Philip Morris USA at the top.  But, I mean, I'm -- if that's the issue, I'm fine with taking it off, if that's the concern.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Is that the only issue?

MR. THORNE:  Well, I mean, I also have concerns about authentication of the document because I don't know how anybody authenticates if that's where it came from at this point.  We can't find it on the website at this point.  I can't verify the authenticity of it.  All I know is that this is what was produced to us with the exhibits and -- which is inconsistent with what it looks like there.  But either way, I don't know how they establish authenticity of it.

MR. BIGGER:  We can deal with the experts if you wish, I mean, he's looked at the websites repeatedly many times over.  If he can establish that, sure.  There's a thing called the Wayback Machine which captures, so that as companies change their websites, they're not allowed to bury

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

things or hide things.  They have to keep what was there -- I'm sorry.  Sorry about that.

THE COURT:  You break it, you buy it.

MR. BIGGER:  Yeah.  Seriously.

What was there will always be there.  Sorry. I'm tearing the place up, Your Honor.  I apologize.  But we can -- let me just -- if that's the issue �

THE COURT:  Okay.  If you could check on that.  And at the very least, the Philip Morris USA title will be redacted from this document. And as long as you can provide the authenticity, then the Court would overrule any objection with that redaction.

MR. BIGGER:  That's fine.  In light of the from direct to cross, if we can maybe -- not be done in the presence of the jury.  If we could just have a proffer with the witness where we can lay the foundation for authenticity.

MR. THORNE:  That's fine with me, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Let's take a break. (Recess taken from 10:21 a.m. to. (Court called to order at 10:35 a.m.)

MR. BIGGER:  Your Honor, just for your background, I spoke with the defense, and we'll do

THE COURT:  Okay.  How long is that going to take?

MR. BIGGER:  The proffer?  The proffer is just a few questions, I think, and then the authoritativeness of some literature, potentially, we might want to lay out a proffer before that as well.

THE COURT:  Well, as you know, the Court gets a little cranky if he doesn't get his lunch.

All right, ladies and gentlemen.  We'll begin the cross-examination.  I do want to also give you another -- or the same limiting instruction as to Mr. Heimann's deposition.

His previous deposition testimony is introduced only as to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and not as to Philip Morris USA.

So, Counsel, you may proceed on cross.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it please the Court, Ms. Barbose, Counsel, members of the jury.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings. A.   Good morning.

Q.   My name is Ed Carter.  We've met before, haven't we?

A.   We have.

Q.   I would like to start out, you mentioned the Surgeon General's report that came out in 1964, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=527
1896

A.   Yes.

Q.   From 1964 until 1979, that 15-year period after the report, 30 million Americans are reported as having quit smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   When those 30 million quit, there was a lot of cigarette advertising, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the Council for Tobacco Research was still in business?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The Tobacco Institute was still in business?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And both of those groups were making public statements during that 15-year period, correct?

A.   They were.

Q.   The tobacco companies themselves were making public statements during that period?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You showed the jury some of the statements over the last day and change, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The Surgeon General and other members of the public health community were also speaking publicly during that time?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=528
1897

A.   Yes.

Q.   For example, I believe you told the jury, when the 1964 Surgeon General report came out, it was highly publicized?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The warning label first appeared on cigarette packages in 1966, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   During that time period, 1964 to 1979, Mr. Barbose was smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He turned 45 in 1979; right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The Surgeon General has described the 30 million people who quit during that 15-year period of time as the highest rate of quitting for any other time period during the nation's history, correct?

A.   Yes.  I can explain it if you would like.

Q.   I think that's sufficient.  Thank you. And 30 million people --

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes. (At sidebar.) MR. CLARK:  If the witness need to explain

his answer, he can answer the question.  And he

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=529
1898

said he needed to explain.  I don't think it's proper for counsel to cut him off and tell him he can't explain his answer.  If the witness wants to explain, he's welcome to explain his answer after he's answered the question.

THE COURT:  Knowing this witness, I'm surprised he didn't offer the explanation.  But, Counsel, I mean, this is something that could be addressed on cross-examine -- or redirect, I understand.

MR. CARTER:  It is.  If he would have gone further, I would have moved to strike and impeached him on prior testimony where he said no explanation.

THE COURT:  You can address it on redirect.

MR. CLARK:  You bet, okay. (End of sidebar.)

MR. CARTER:  May I continue, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  You may.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   30 million people, that's a number greater than the population of the state of Florida, correct?

A.   Were classified -- yes, it is, and were classified as former smokers at that time which is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=530
1899

based on two questions that are asked, Have you smoked a hundred cigarettes?  He answered yes.  And then they have a follow-up question:  If you answered yes to a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime, do you currently smoke now?

So some of those 30 million would relapse back to smoking.  So it's just a point in time estimate.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I'd move to strike as nonresponsive everything after the "yes." THE COURT:  I'll grant that request and direct that the witness please only answer the question being posed.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   On average, 2 million Americans who would have quit every year during that 15-year period?

A.   Based on that definition, that would be true. Q.   5,000 to 6,000 per day?

A.   Would be classified as former smokers based on hundreds of cigarettes in an answer of, No, not currently smoking as of that day.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I move to strike again.

THE COURT:  Overrule that objection.  I

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=531
1900

believe he can answer that.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge. BY MR. CARTER:

Q. The 30 million reported as quitters from 1964 to 1979, the great majority of them were quitting cold turkey without any assistance, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so because of the nicotine gum had not been invented yet, those 30 million were quitting without nicotine gum, correct?

A.   Yes.  As of 1979, that's true.

Q.   And those 30 million quitting at that time period in the '60s and '70s were quitting without the aid of the nicotine patch, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And almost every one of them would have quit without some sort of medical intervention or a doctor's help, correct?

A.   Not necessarily true, but most people were trying to quit on their own.  There wasn't a lot of assistance.  There were a few clinics and there were some over-the-counter aids that were available at that time.

Q.   So my question to you, Doctor, almost every one of them quit without some sort of medical

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=532
1901

intervention or a doctor's professional help, fair?

A.   Actually, unfair.  Many of them quit because they had serious health problems and they went to the doctor and, you know, they were diagnosed with cancer or COPD or heart attack or whatever and were told to stop smoking.

Q.   Doctor, you are familiar with providing testimony in the Cooper trial, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   I'm going to pull a copy of that and I'll give you a copy as well.

MR. CARTER:  May I approach the witness, Your

Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may, Counsel. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Here you go, Doctor.

A.   Thank you.

Q.   You're welcome.

In the Cooper trial, you took an oath just like today, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And you swore to tell the truth?

A.   Always do.

Q.   I'd like to refer you to page 1846 of your testimony, please.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=533
1902

A.   Okay.

Q.   Lines 13 through 16.

Are you there? A.   I am. Q.   And you were asked:

"Question:  And almost every one of them quit without some sort of medical intervention or a doctor's professional help; is that fair?"

And the answer you provided was:  "That is fair."

Was that your testimony in the Cooper trial? A.   Yes. Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

Based on your -- well, you generally talked about the fact that Mr. Barbose tried to quit, correct? A.   Yes.

Q.   I would like to get into some of the specifics.  You didn't discuss any specific quit attempt that he made during your presentation with Mr. Clark, did you? A.   No. Q.   Let's talk about that a little bit now.

Based on your review of the evidence, you agree that Mr. Barbose made no effort to quit smoking in the 1950s, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=534
1903

A.   True.

Q.   No effort to quit smoking by Mr. Barbose in the 1960s, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Same for the 1970s, no effort to quit smoking reported for the 1970s?

A.   Unclear.  But most of the quit attempts were in the '80s, as I recall, '80s and '90s.

Q.   I would like to refer you to your deposition in this case, please.

MR. CARTER:  May I approach again, Your

Honor?

THE COURT:  You may. MR. CARTER:  Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   There you are.

A.   Thanks.

Q.   You're welcome.

Doctor, if you would turn with me to page 107 of your deposition.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Lines 13 through 15. Are you with me?

A.   I am.

Q.   Doctor, in your deposition, you were asked

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=535
1904

the question, quote, "Did Mr. Barbose ever attempt to try and quit in the 1970s?"

And the answer you provided was, "Not that I'm aware of."

That was your testimony in deposition, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Thank you, sir.

Based on your review of the evidence, Mr. Barbose never tried to quit smoking until the late 1980's at some point, correct?

A.   There was clear recollection from family in the late '80s, from '85 to '90.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, true or false; even addicted smokers can quit smoking?

A.   True.

Q.   Addicted smokers do quit smoking every day in this country, correct?

A.   Most quit and end up relapsing back to smoking.

Q.   The answer to my question, though, is, they do quit every day, correct?

A. They do quit every day and most will relapse back to smoking, so people make quit attempts all the time .

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=536
1905

Q.   Highly-addicted smokers quit every day, correct?

A.   Highly-addicted smokers make quit attempts every day, yes.

Q.   I would like to get the Dion transcript, please.

MR. CARTER:  May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Here you are.

A.   Thanks.

Q.   If you would turn with me, please, to page 1888.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Lines seven through ten.

You were asked the question, "True or false; addicted smokers can and do quit smoking every day, including highly-addicted smokers."

And the answer you provided was "True," correct?

A.   I'm sorry.  What page are you on?

1888, line seven through ten.

Okay.  Sorry.

I'm sorry for not giving you enough time

That's all right.  I just went to 1898.

That's a
	11.  Okay.
	
	
	

Q.
	So the ques
	tion you were aske

case, un

highly-a
	ddicted smok
	ers . "
	
	


	And the answer you provided was, "True,"
			
correct?
	
	
	
	

A.
	Yes.  Just
	what I said
	before
	�

Q.
	Included in
	the number
	of smo
	kers who quit

smoking
	are those wh
	o smoke a pc
	ack and
	a half a day?

A.
	Yes.
	
	
	

Q.
	It includes
	those who
	smoke t
	wo packs a day?

A.
	True.
	
	
	

Q.
	It includes
	people who
	smoke
	unfiltered

cigarett
	es?
	
	
	

A.
	True.
	
	
	

Q.
	It includes
	people who
	smoke
	filtered

cigarett
	es?
	
	
	

A.
	True.
	
	
	

Q.
	It includes
	people who
	smoke
	light

cigarett
	es?
	
	
	

A.
	True.
	
	
	

Q.
	There are more former
		smokers
	alive today in

the Unit
	ed States th
	an there are curre

correct?
	
	
	
	

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=538
1907

A.   True.

Q.   According to the Centers for Disease Control's latest data, the current prevalence rate for smoking among adults 18 and over is down to 16.8 percent, correct?

A.   Incorrect.  I can give you the latest statistics.  First quarter of the year was 15 percent.

Q.   All right.  You have your deposition still in front of you?

A.   I do.  But I've just given you the latest figures from the CDC.

Q.   Thank you.  Those latest figures were from first quarter of 2015?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And in your deposition, you were asked about the then existing latest figures, correct?

A.   The deposition in this case?

Q.   Yes.

A.   In July of this year, yes.

Q.   In July of this year.

And when did the 2015 CDC statistics come out?

A.   Just came out in -- the first quarter were released in September of this year.

Q.   So 16.8 as of your deposition, and it's even

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=539
1908

lower now?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Now, the data from the Centers for Disease Control estimate that there are 60 million former smokers in this country, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And it's not just statistics; you, yourself, have said multiple times that there are 60 million former smokers in this country?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And just so there's no confusion, those 60 million who have quit, those are people alive today, correct?

A.   They're alive at the time of the interview where they're asked those two questions that I mentioned.

Q.   And that 60 million, that number goes back a long time; it's not just the last ten to 15 years?

A.   That 60 million are people alive, you know, at this time.  They do the surveys, large population survey.  They ask you whether you've smoked a hundred cigarettes.  That makes you a never smoker, if you answer yes.  And then they ask, you know, if you currently smoke every day, some days, or not at all. Or not at all is considered the former smokers.  And

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=540
1909

they estimate that based on the population which, of course, has grown dramatically since the middle of the century.

Q.   We talked about the 15-year period from '64 to '79.  I want to talk about that entire 60 million. Most of the 60 million who have quit in the United States have done so cold turkey, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And most of those 60 million would have been exposed to years of cigarette advertising, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   Most of those 60 million would have heard statements from the Surgeon General or the public health community?

A.   Certainly, over time, I would say that's more true, particularly from the '80s.  Dr. Koop, in particular, was quite successful getting his message out in the '80s.

Q.   Some of those of 60 million would have heard statements from the tobacco companies as well, correct?

A.   All of them would.  If you're buying cigarettes, you're getting statements right there.  In the advertising, you're responding and relying on the information you're getting from the companies.

Q.   Of those 60 million who have quit, the vast

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=541
1910

majority of them, in your view, were addicted?

A.   My view as well as the criteria from Philip Morris, for example.

MR. CARTER:  Move to strike, Your Honor,

after the witness provided his view.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection to

that motion. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Fair to say that 40 to 50 million addicted smokers have quit smoking, correct?

A.   Yeah.  I think that's about 85 to 90 percent of smokers are addicted smokers.

Q.   And within that population, millions of them have been highly-addicted smokers, according to you, correct?

A.   Yeah.  I mean, there's obviously a range of dependence which you can score on the Heaviness of Smoking Index, but many of them would fall into the highly-dependent category.

Q.   And many of the 60 million who quit would have smoked unfiltered cigarettes at some point?

A.   Yeah, depending on when they began their smoking careers.  Certainly if you started in the early, you know, late '40s, early '50s, that was the predominant type of product available at the time.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=542
1911

Q.   And the vast majority of them would have also smoked filtered cigarettes?

A.   Well, many people, as we know, did switch over to filters.  They dominate the market today. About 99 percent of cigarettes are filtered today. Q.   Is that a "yes" to my question? A.   Yes. Q.   Thank you.

You talked about brain receptors during your presentation.  I believe that was back on Friday, correct?

A.   I don't know if I did or not. Q.   Okay.  The 60 million who quit, they had receptors in their brain called acetylcholine receptors?

MR. CLARK:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we approach?  Beyond -- it's outside the scope. (At sidebar.)

THE COURT:  You're saying Friday he did not testify on that?

MR. CLARK:  We did not talk about the receptors in the brain.  We didn't get into the neurobiology aspect of this.  That's a completely different witness.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, I have a note from

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=543
1912

this morning, "Addiction's left where there are permanent changes to the brain."  I've even circled it.  It may not have been Friday, but certainly today.

MR. CARTER:  I have my notes reflecting the discussion of the brain changes.

MR. CLARK:  I believe the witness even just testified -- he's like, I don't -- I think he said he didn't -- he wasn't sure that we testified --he testified to that.

THE COURT:  And that's not contrary to the rule -- motion in limine in Daubert?

MR. CLARK:  No, sir.  That testimony would be something different.  That's not related necessarily to the cigarette design.  That's more of a neurobiology aspect of nicotine addiction.

THE COURT:  Again, this is two days of testimony.  I don't recall the word "receptors" necessarily during his testimony, but the brain function, that sort of thing, he did testify to. I don't know if we're just talking semantics there.

MR. CARTER:  I can rephrase it without the word "receptors."  That's not necessary.

THE COURT:  I think that that would be

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=544
1913

appropriate.  So to that extent, I'll grant the objection and have you rephrase the question.

MR. CARTER:  All right.  Thank you.

MR.  CLARK:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I mean, my main concern is that we don't fall victim to an argument of this being cumulative because it gets talked about on cross-examination when it wasn't something that we necessarily brought up, because we do have another Ph.D. that's going to come in and render the addiction opinion.  And that's my main concern.

THE COURT:  Just stay up here.

Question?  One of the jurors have a question or concern?

The question of the juror is:  "How many smokers quit smoking from 1974 to 1979?"

This is not the appropriate time for the jury to be asking these questions, but you need to direct it in that direction.  I'll leave it up to counsel as to whether you want to address that now or I'll just tell this juror.

MR. CARTER:  Sure.  That's one of the questions that I already asked.  I can fix that in about ten seconds.

THE COURT:  Do you mind if he addresses that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=545
1914

question?

MR. CLARK:  He already asked it.  It's obviously a question in the juror's mind.  My guess is the juror may have missed it and they're just trying to reconfirm what it is.

THE COURT:  I'll tell them that we'll deal with these issues at the end.

(End of sidebar.)

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Just for the edification of the jury, we will be addressing the specific juror questions at the end when it's all over, the direct examination, cross-examination, perhaps redirect examination.  I think this is something that they'll go into for you.

Thank you, Counsel.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge.  May I continue?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   And just to be sure that we didn't miss it, during 1964 to 1979, the statistic of the number of smokers reported as quitting is 15 million, correct? A.   From 1964 to '79? Q.   Yes. A.   I thought it 30 million.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=546
1915

Q.   30 million.

A.   Yes.

Q.   15 million is that first window from up until 1970, correct?

A.   I think that's 13 million, actually, is the number that's in the Surgeon General's reports.  It's primarily due to the Fairness Doctrine period, but I can explain it if you would like.

Q.   The number --

A.   The number is about 13 million.

Q.   13 million.  Thank you.

Back to the 60 million who quit, 60 million former smokers, those smokers would have smoked all sorts of different brands of cigarettes, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Looking at the brands that are popularly sold, a large portion of those 60 million would have smoked brands manufactured by R.J. Reynolds?

A.   True.

Q.   Similar as to Philip Morris?

A.   Yeah, Philip Morris certainly in the '80s and 90's was the market share leader, Marlboro and Marlboro Lights.  Before that, it was Winston.

Q.   You talked about cigarette design with Mr. Clark.  You would agree that the majority of the 60

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=547
1916

million former smokers in this country would have smoked cigarettes with many of the same design features that you described?

A.   Well, broadly speaking, they had filters. They had the American blend.  Recon came in, but the actual formulas of the brands were not constant within a brand.  They changed over time.  So Marlboros changed from year to year, as did Winston.  I think I gave you example of Winston going to ammoniation in 1979.

So there was variation over time and they weren't always the same by brand.  And the brand-specific information was trade secret.

Q.   Let's talk about some of the specific design features you discussed.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Of the 60 million, many of them would have smoked cigarettes that had the ventilated filter holes you showed the jury on the ELMO?

A.   More recently, that's true.  I think we showed a Marlboro and a Marlboro Light, the two vent rings in Marlboro Lights versus one in Marlboro.  But when Marlboro was first introduced, it did not have filter vents.  So that is something that came in later.

Q.   So the question �

A.   So it changed over time.  That was one of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=548
1917

those examples of something being altered over time, year-to-year variation in the product.

Q.   And maybe I asked it poorly.  I intended my question to be simpler.

Simply, many of the 60 million former smokers smoked cigarettes that had ventilated filter holes at some point?

A.   Yeah.  If they were smoking up to today, that would be true.

Q.   A majority of the 60 million former smokers smoked cigarettes that would have had reconstituted tobacco?

A.   Generally, that's true.

Q.   The 60 million who quit would have smoked cigarettes with flavorants in them?

A.   True.

Q.   They would have smoked cigarettes that had additives in them?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You talked about ammonia just a moment ago. Ammonia is something that's in bread as well, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   Ammonia is in cheese?

A.   Sure.

Q.   It's in most of our baked goods, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   You mentioned towards the end of your presentation some of the work that you did in Buffalo in smoking cessation, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   And you wrote a guide for the American Cancer Society that was entitled "Smart Move, A Stop Smoking Guide," correct?

A.   I did.

Q.   And the title -- you chose that title because it's a smart move for people to quit smoking?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER: I would like to pull up AN133,

please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This is the cover to that stop smoking guide, correct?

A.   That's right.

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. (At sidebar.) MR. CLARK:  Since this is the first document

that's being shown to Dr. Cummings outside of the

deposition, now's the time that I anticipate

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

what's going to happen is they're going to reference documents and not show the witness and give the witness an opportunity.  The witness has the right to have all the documents.  I have the right to have the full document shown to me before it's given to the witness so that we could do the rule of completeness or I can object if there's an issue.  Just throwing one up there that we haven't been provided yet is not proper.

MR. CARTER:  We have copies.  I'll provide them.  If this one went too fast, it was because it was on the preadmit list, so I thought it was going to be more streamlined.  But I'm happy to go to my boxes, get a copy, hand them out to whoever needs it.  I'm sure Dr. Cummings has seen this one in every case.

THE COURT:  I think it would be appropriate.

MR. CARTER:  All right. (End of sidebar.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Doctor, would you like a copy?

A.   I know it well.

Q.   I figured you might.

MR. CARTER:  May we have it back on the screen, please?

BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This was the brochure that you used in your clinic in New York, correct?

A.   I did.

Q.   You believe that the information contained in it is truthful and accurate?

A.   At the time I wrote it in 1987, yes.

Q.   In your Smart Move pamphlets, you have testimonials from some patients who attended the clinic, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And you put those testimonials in the guides as a motivator to show people that there are other people who had successfully quit, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you yourself selected the testimonials to be included?

A.   Yes, I asked people permission if I could use their quotes.  The pictures in the guide, I think the Cancer Society Photoshopped them or whatever, so they have adversity of people in the guide, but the quotes are from people in my clinic.

Q.   So the actual content of the message is from the people in your clinic.

The images that we'll see right now were

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

selected by ACS, correct?

A.   That's right.

MR. CARTER:  Could we look at one of the

testimonials from an Yvette J on page 3. THE WITNESS:  Sure.

MR. CARTER:  Blow that up, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Would you read the testimonial from Yvette J, a former one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker, please.

A.   Sure.

"I always thought it would be impossible to stop.  Anyone can do it if they set their mind to it. A positive attitude is important."

Q.   And it indicates that she was a former one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You know from your review of the materials in this case that Mr. Barbose is reported as being between a one-to-two-pack-a-day smoker, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In the brochure, you also have a checklist asking people if they have what it takes to stop smoking, correct?

A.   Right.  It's a readiness to see whether you're ready to make a quit attempt.

MR. CARTER:  And could we blow up the top,

please?  Thank you.  The whole highlighted

section. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Now, the heading doesn't say, "Do you have what it takes to make an attempt to quit smoking?"  It reads, "Do you have what it takes to stop smoking," correct?

A.   True.  It says what it says.  It's there as a readiness test and, in fact, the three areas that we ask about are covered in different parts of the self-help guide.

Q.   And the self-help guide reads, "There's no magic cure that can help you stop.  Take this short quiz to find out if you have what it takes.  Question one, do you want to stop smoking?"

Did I read that correctly so far?

A.   You did.

Q.   Now, this first question, that's asking about motivation, correct?

A. It is about motivation. All three of these are about motivations. It's a readiness test to see how motivated people are to make a quit attempt.

Q.   And you agree that it takes motivation to quit smoking?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=554
1923

A.   Sure.

Q.   If you're not motivated to quit, you're not going to quit?

A.   If you're not ready to make a quit attempt --obviously, that's the first step -- you're not going to be quitting.

But motivation is not enough.  In fact, it's not a very good predictor of who's able to quit and sustain staying off.  Nicotine addiction is the main predictor of a long-term abstinence.

Q.   And I didn't intend to ask about predictors. My question was simply if someone is not motivated to quit smoking, in your view, they will not be successful at it, correct?

A.   You've got to be motivated is the first step, obviously, yes.

Q.   Thank you.

Now, you, from your review of the case materials, agree that Mr. Barbose was not motivated to quit smoking in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, or up until 1985?

A.   We don't know about his motivation, based on the material, one way or the other.  He did make quit attempts, as best as I could tell from the testimony from family members.  They recalled the quit attempts

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=555
1924

in the '80s and the '90s.

Q.   And you believe that he was first motivated to quit in the latter part of the 1980s, correct?

A.   It's clear that he was making quit attempts. And that's a behavioral indicator of motivation to quit.  He's using stop-smoking aids.  I think there's mention of gum and he's using substitutes like a toothpick and candy.  He's -- later on, he's using the nicotine patch.  I think there was testimony about that.

So there's clear indication that he's motivated to quit and not succeeding at it.

Q.   And clear indication, and what's your view, that there was no motivation in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and up until that time prior?

A.   No.  What I said, and maybe you didn't hear me, there's no indication one way or the other.  In fact, many quit attempts by smokers are done in what we call the closet.  Usually the attempts that are represented by family members are the ones that tend to have lasted a little bit longer and often involve quit-smoking aids, like using medications.

And that was true here.  We don't know, because I was not able to speak with Mr. Barbose to actually ask him, but my experience from research and

dealing
	with smokers is they do a lot of their quit
	
attempts
	> in the closet away from everybody in the
	

family.
	Most of them end up as failures, usually
	short

duration, and they end up back smoking again.
		

Q.
	Do you have your deposition still handy,
	

Doctor?
	
	

A.
	I do.
	

Q.
	If you would turn with me to page 103,
	

please.
	Page 103 starting on line 15.
	

A.
	Okay.
	

Q.
	Thank you, Doctor.
	


	In your deposition, you were asked, starting
	
at line
	15:
	


	"Question:  Was Mr. Barbose motivated to
	quit

smoking
	in the 1950s? "Answer:  No.
	


	"Question:  Was Mr. Barbose motivated to
	quit

smoking
	in the 1960s? "Answer:  It doesn't appear he was.
	


	"Question:  Was Mr. Barbose motivated to
	quit

smoking
	in the 1970s? "Answer:  It does not appear he was.
	


	"Question:  Was Mr. Barbose motivated to
	quit

smoking
	in the 1980s? "Answer:  Yes.

pgNbr=557
1926

"Question:  At what point in the 1980s was Mr. Barbose motivated to quit smoking?

"Answer:  Appeared toward the latter part of the 1980s."

Was that the testimony you provided in your deposition in this case?

A.   Yes.  Same as I've just indicated, based on the evidence that's available from the family members. Q.   Let's go back to the pamphlet.

The second question, "Are you willing to make some changes in your daily routine?"

As you indicated, that's another question that talks about motivation? A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   The third question, "Are you willing to put up with some uneasy moments after stopping?" Correct? A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, again, you used the word "willing" there, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And you agree that there well may be uneasy moments after stopping and you have to put up with them?

A.   Unfortunately, because of nicotine addiction,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=558
1927

there is nicotine withdrawal.  And that often is a problem for people because they get cranky and irritable and they crave having a cigarette and it's easy to pick one back up.

Q.   And what did you write in your brochure after those three questions?

A.   Said, "If you can answer yes to all three questions, you can stop smoking."

Q.   Did you write on that page anywhere that if you answer all three questions yes, you can make a quit attempt?

A.   No, but that -- you know, it was --basically, it's a motivational guide to try to get people to make a quit attempt.  I knew what the intention of, you know, writing the guide.  I wrote the guide as a motivational guide to help people quit smoking, because it was sent out to people who contacted the Cancer Society as a self-help guide for quitting smoking used for about a decade.

Q.   Let's look at another page in the self-help guide.  Can we turn to the next page, please. This is another testimonial, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Will you read this to the jury, please?

A.   "The most important thing is to really make

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=559
1928

the commitment and decision to stop.  No program can benefit you until the decision to stop is made." That's Form C, former two-and-a-half pack a day smoker.

Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

MR. CARTER:  If we could look at page 9,

please.  Pull up the highlight.  Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   "The good news about stopping.  Have you ever said, 'Why bother stopping?  The damage is already done.'  Wrong.  Your body begins to repair itself as soon as you stop smoking.  Within a few days, mucus in your airways breaks up and clears out of your lungs. Within a few weeks, circulation improves and you'll be able to smell and taste more.  Within a year, your risk of lung cancer begins to decrease."

That's what you wrote in your pamphlet, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   And you believe that that is true, correct?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   Smoking cessation offers tremendous benefits even for patients with active cancer, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You never tell your smokers, "It's too late, you've been smoking too long, there's no benefit to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=560
1929

quitting?"

A.   That's true.

Q.   Usually, two to three days after a person smokes their last cigarette, the nicotine is out of their system, correct?

A.   That's true.  You can measure metabolites of nicotine that go on a little bit longer, but nicotine has a, you know, fairly quick half-life of clearing the body.

Q.   It has a half-life of about, you know --within about two hours because of the half-life, half of the nicotine is out of the system, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And on average, withdrawal symptoms in smokers who experience those, peak within a few days, correct?

A.   They tend to be most intense in the first, you know, week or so after somebody quits, usually around day three or four, where they hit ground zero in terms of the nicotine.  That's when people tend to report the most intensity, but they can go on for --for weeks.

Q.   And after that peak intensity, the nature of a peak, it declines, correct?

A.   Generally, that's true on average.  Although

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=561
1930

there are individual variation that you can see, but on average, that's true.

Q.   And on average, physical withdrawal symptoms will end after three weeks or so?

A.   They don't end.  They dissipate.  Cravings in particular, which are often situationally related, like Pavlov's dog, you know -- you know, gets associated with their cup of coffee or morning routine in the car, whatever, stress, and those things often trigger strong urges to smoke.  And that can go on for quite a while, years after people quit smoking.

And so even somebody who quits and refrains for -- for months, and I've seen years, a crisis happens and they pick up a cigarette.  And it's like they're back to where they were when they were smoking.

Q.   And my question is asking about average.  Do you agree that on average, physical withdrawal symptoms will end after about three weeks or so?

A.   Not end.

Q.   Okay.

MR. CARTER:  May I have the Evers transcript,

please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   We'll move on while they're looking for that one .

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=562
1931

A.   Sure.

Q. You agree that withdrawal symptoms do not make it impossible for someone to permanently quit smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In your pamphlet, you talk about relapse and how if you picked up a cigarette again, that doesn't mean you should just give up?

A.   We do.

Q.   Let's look at page 21 of the pamphlet, please.

This is that concept, isn't it?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Will you read -- will you read this to the jury, Doctor?

A.   Sure.  Do you want me to read it?

Q.   Yes, please.

A.   "Picking yourself back up.  Something went wrong, you had a terrible day, you smoked that one cigarette, don't be discouraged.  Almost everyone who has tried to stop smoking has faced this moment of truth.  Many go back to smoking, you don't have to join them."

Q.   That's recognition in your pamphlet that for many people it takes multiple attempts to quit smoking?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=563
1932

A.   Yes.  Recognition that you just can't, you know, quit and assume that you can walk away from it, and most people will have a slip.  And it's acknowledging that and to try to give people advice not to get discouraged.

Q.   And you give them that advice and try to prevent them from being discouraged because you believe that if they are persistent and keep trying, that they can, in fact, quit?

A.   I give them that advice because the reality is addicted smokers -- this is a chronic relapsing brain disorder, and that most people are going to end up relapsing back to smoking, and as a result of that, you know, we're not hiding the truth, we're telling people.  So it's not that you can just say, I'm going to stop smoking, and do it.  That's what I -- and I think it's explained to you, maybe you didn't get it, those three questions, but that's clearly not what we're telling smokers in the guide.

Q.   If they persist and keep trying, they can quit.  True?

A. I never tell anybody to give up. So I say that to people, keep going, keep trying. I'll work with you as long as it takes.

Q.   And I'm not asking if you're telling them one

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=564
1933

thing and believe something different.  I'm saying you believe that they, in fact, can quit if they are persistent and keep trying?

A.   Yes.  I know the reality, but the -- I'm just giving you what I do clinically.  And this was the guide written for smokers, and I certainly try to be a coach for the smokers to help them get off because there's such a dramatic urgency for them to stop because of what we know about how dangerous smoking is

Q.   Let's look at one more section from the pamphlet, pages 12 and 13, please.

"Stopping."  And then you provide four bullet points, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   "Develop a plan, change some habits, the bottom line, make a commitment," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The American Cancer Society republished your "Smart Move" pamphlet in 1997, correct?

A.   They did.

Q.   And when smokers came to your clinic in Buffalo, you told them that the success rate for quitting for people who really want to quit and stick with it is 100 percent, correct?

A.   I said you're ready to make a quit attempt

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=565
1934

and everybody can quit.  So, of course, that's what I'm telling people, but that I also -- if you only took that, that would be way out of context because then I tell people the reality is just like we said, many of you are going to slip, don't give up.  We'll keep working with you.

So I certainly try to be motivational, and I give people the facts and I tell them as much as I have learned about cigarettes, because most people haven't a clue.

Q.   When smokers came to your stop-smoking clinic, you told them the success rate for them if they were committed to quitting is a hundred percent?

A.   That's true, given the context of the answer I just gave.

Q.   And you've testified previously that anyone can quit smoking if they make up their mind to do it?

A.   Anybody can make a quit attempt.  That's the first step.  We're trying to get them to make quit attempts.

Q.   And again, I'm -- my question isn't focused on quit attempt, it's the broader statement.  You have testified in the past that anyone can quit smoking if they make up their mind to do it, correct?

A.   And my testimony to you is that's the context

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=566
1935

of the answer that I have given repeatedly in my testimony, is I'm talking about making quit attempts, not the broader issue of refraining from smoking for the rest of your life.  So you're never going to pick up a cigarette.  That's not the reality.  The reality is people that are addicted to your client's cigarettes will struggle to stop smoking and most will fail. MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, may we approach? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. (At sidebar.)

MR. CARTER:  I'm obviously concerned about the attempts to preop my questions by providing context before providing the answer.  I don't want to fight with him in front of the jury.  I would request an instruction to the witness to listen to the question and answer it.  If he then thinks that there's context that needs to be provided, he can indicate that after he's answered the question.  I think I'm entitled to simple answers to simple questions.  Otherwise, I'll be impeaching him all day.

THE COURT:  I understand, and then he starts that and you move for strike as non responsive. So it's kind of -- Counsel, response?

MR. CLARK:  Our response is Dr. Cummings'

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=567
1936

answered the question.  He's agreed that he has, and he's trying to put it into context so the jury doesn't get misled.

That's the reason why -- why the slides were shown in opening statements and Dr. Cummings testified that those things were taken out of context because we anticipated that the statements taken out of context are going to be used to try to mislead this jury.

He's answered the question.  It's time to move on.

I think if they continue it's badgering.  If they continue to ask another time or two, I was going to say starting to harass and badger the witness because I believe he has answered the question.  He has testified to that.  And he's trying to put it in context.

MR. CARTER:  I think the last answer was a pretty emblematic example of inappropriate speech going on talking about the clients and everything else.  It's a simple question, Have you testified to it in the past.  I've got him on video saying it.

THE COURT:  I've already tried to instruct this witness multiple times.  The questions that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=568
1937

you're asking, there are no "yes" or "no" type responses, unfortunately, it doesn't appear.

So I'm going to overrule the objection.  I'll try to wield him as best I can.

MR. CLARK:  I'll just ask if � if the Court becomes concerned that we take a break and we send the jury out and we'll see if we can address it without the jury present first.  But I would at least like that opportunity.  But I agree that these are not just simple yes or no answers. MR. CARTER:  I have a page of yes or no answers to these exact same questions, and that's where I'm torn between fighting with the witness or -- that's why I wanted to ask for some assistance.

I'll keep on keeping on. THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you. (End of sidebar.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   When you started your presentation Thursday of last week, you told the jury the questions that you were asked by counsel to answer about the Barbose case, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to ask you about when you received

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=569
1938

that assignment.  You told the jury about the materials that you reviewed in forming your opinions in this case, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Those materials include the depositions taken in this case?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The medical records?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And they include verified worksheets that Ms. Barbose completed, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, those materials were sent to you in preparation for this case, correct?

A.   Those materials were sent.  I also conducted searches of internal industry business records and searches of relevant public literature.

Q.   But all of the materials specific to Mr. Barbose that have been produced for this case, those were sent to you, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Now, the first time you received those materials was April 20th of this year, correct?

A.   That's probably about right.

Q.   And it goes without saying that you were not

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=570
1939

able t
	o review the case-specific materials and form

opinions based on those until they were in your
	
possession for you to physically review them, correct?
	
A.
	True.

Q.
	Now, you know that you were disclosed as an

expert
	in this case back on March 6th of this year,

correct?
	
A.
	I don't know what the disclosure date was.

Q.
	All right.  Do you have your deposition in

front
	of you?

A.
	Sure .

Q.
	I'd like to try to refresh your recollection

first.
	

A.
	Okay.  What page?

Q.
	It's page 44.

A.
	Okay.

Q.
	If you look at lines 8 through 20, read those

to yourself, please.
	
A.
	Okay.

Q.
	Having read that, does that refresh your

recoil
	ection that you were disclosed in this case on

March
	6th?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Now, you did not review that disclosure

before
	it was prepared, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=571
1940

A.   I did not.

Q.   And no one talked to you about that disclosure before it was prepared, correct?

A.   I believe I had talked to the lawyers who had asked me to participate in the case and we had a phone conversation.  They hadn't sent me the materials for the case until April.

Q.   So you had not received those materials until a little over a month and a half later, correct?

A.   I'm -- I'm guessing that was the case.  I'd have to go read through the deposition to see because I was required to turn over all correspondence that I had.  So it would be based on -- usually I get the materials electronically.  Sometimes I get them mailed to my home.  So I'd have to see what the correspondence says .

Q.   And I'd like you to have the benefit of that information.  So refresh your recollection, if you would look at 31, 1 through 6.

A.   Okay.  Thanks for directing me there.  I'm sure it was asked.  Yeah, I can see it.

Q.   And so you received those materials April 20th?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you told the jury that until you received

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=572
1941

the internal documents from the tobacco companies, you did not know the real story about the tobacco industry, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the same would apply to Mr. Barbose, until you received the documents that -- the testimony in this case, the medical records, the verified worksheet, you would not have had the benefit of the details of Mr. Barbose's story until you received those, correct?

A.   Not necessarily.  I believe typically what I do when I call on the phone, are you available, will you participate.  There's -- I ask for details on the case, and then I will verify those details by going through the materials.  I don't accept anything just, you know, in a conversation.

But typically, the phone call comes first and then the details come rolling in afterwards, often because those depositions are being done at the time --before, you know, I receive, you know, the materials. Obviously, the depositions have to be done of family members before they can be sent to me.

Q.   Is it your testimony today that you, in fact, had a conversation with plaintiff's counsel prior to your disclosure in this case?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=573
1942

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you tell us that at your deposition?

A.   If I was asked, I probably did.

Q.   Okay.  You had not reviewed for yourself any testimony, any deposition, any case materials specific to Mr. Barbose until they were physically sent to you?

A.   True.

Q.   In the materials you received, you reviewed the deposition of Ms. Barbose, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You did not conduct an interview of her, did you?

A.   No.

Q.   And you did not speak to her at all in forming your opinions?

A.   No, I did not.

Q.   That is something you've done in other cases, conduct interviews of the plaintiff, correct?

A.   Typically, if it's the smoker who's still alive, I'll do an interview, if the person is healthy enough to participate in the interview.

Q.   And you did not ask Ms. Barbose's attorneys for permission to talk to her?

A.   No.  She was the spouse, and Mr. Barbose was the smoker in the case.  So, yeah, I just relied on the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=574
1943

family members' depositions.  So her daughters and
	
Mr. Barbose's brother, Samuel.
	
Q
	You did not speak with any of the family

members, Mr. Barbose's brother, Sam, or any of the
	
daughters, correct?
	
A
	No.

Q
	No, you did not speak with them?

A
	I did not speak with them.

Q
	You did not speak with any of Mr. Barbose's

treating physicians, did you?
	
A
	No, I did not.

Q
	Have you read the deposition of the treating

physician, Dr. Stein?
	
A
	No.

Q
	Did you receive it?

A
	No.

Q
	Have you read the deposition of Dr. Drobes?

A
	No.

Q
	Did you receive it?

A
	No.

Q
	Changing gears.

A
	Okay.

Q
	You showed a 1935 document from American

Tobacc
	:o Company, correct?

A
	'36, I believe.  Might have been '35, but

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=575
1944

yes, "The Light Smoke"?

Q.   Yes.  Let's pull that up.

A.   Sure.

MR. CARTER:  It's Plaintiff's Exhibit 2809. And this -- can we go to the next page,

please? BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The date there is December 9th, 1935?

A.   Right.  Just before 1936.

Q.   So almost '36.

A.   We can agree on a compromise here.

Q.   And Mr. Barbose would have been about one year old at the time, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q. Now, the time you showed this with Mr. Clark, there was a rule of completeness. I asked for another portion to be read.  Do you recall that?

A.   Not on -- I'm not recalling specifically on this document.  I know you asked for that on several of the documents.

Q.   There was a suggestion that this document was secret, but we see from the first page this was actually addressed to physicians, correct?

A.   There's no suggestion that this was secret.

Q.   Okay.  So if -- if -- maybe my notes are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=576
1945

wrong.  You have no -- no claim, no suggestion that this document was -- was ever secret, correct?

A.   No.  Just I think we showed it to point out that American Tobacco could denicotinize their cigarettes.  They were specifically talking about Lucky Strike, and this is -- Lucky Strike was a very popular brand in the '30s, and I think we even showed an ad that talked about Lucky Strikes being the favorite cigarette among physicians.

Q.   And that statement about being able to denicotinize cigarettes, that's something that American Tobacco Company put in this pamphlet and sent out to doctors in the public, correct?

A.   That's right.  They said they wouldn't denicotinize.

Q.   You talked about patents.  Do you recall that?

A.   I do.

Q.   You indicated that you have a -- you amassed a large collection, upward of a thousand patents, correct?

A.   Yeah, a little over a thousand patents on all aspects of cigarette design.

Q.   And that was my next question.  The patents deal with cigarette design, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=577
1946

A.   True.

Q. And you didn't have to wait for the tobacco company internal documents to be released before you were able to collect those patents, did you?

A.   True.

Q.   Patents are public; right?

A.   Well, yeah.  I'm not aware of any smokers I've ever come across doing patent searches, but yes, they are in the public domain and a lot easier today because you can go on the Internet and get stuff.

Q.   That's the entire process of a patent, is the U.S. Patent Office, you file your invention, it gets recorded, and that prevents other people from copying it, correct?

A.   True.  Although many of the patents for cigarettes that have been implemented are not available in the United States.  They're patents that were done overseas.

Q.   And the United States patents are public, they're filed with the U.S. Patent Office?

A.   True.

Q.   And if you were curious about cigarette design in 1985, you could have searched the U.S. Patent Office and found whatever patents had been filed by that point in time?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=578
1947

A.   Yeah.  1985, I'd probably have to go to the U.S. Patent Office and actually go into their files to look at it.  So it would have been a little bit more cumbersome than it is today, but yes, you could.  I guess somebody could have done that.

Q.   Speaking of patents and inventions, one of the documents you showed was a 1953 disclosure of an invention by Dr. Teague, correct?

A.   Correct.  Discoloring the filter?

Q. Yes. Now, in that document, Dr. Teague proposed looking at a filter that would have had color-changing material, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And as of 1953, R.J. Reynolds wasn't even selling a filtered cigarette, correct?

A.   '53, that is correct.  They came out with their filter the next year.

Q.   And despite Dr. league's recommendation, you know that Reynolds never used the particular invention described in the memo you showed the jury, correct?

A.   Actually, what I said is I don't know whether they ever used it or not.

Q.   So bottom line is, you can't tell this jury here, that Dr. league's idea discussed in that memo was actually put into a product, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=579
1948

A.   That's right.  We wouldn't know because the, you know, brand formulations were secret.

Q.   You showed the jury two letters from the 1920s that were sent to division sales managers, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   1927 and 1928?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Both seven to eight years before Mr. Barbose was born, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Two decades before he was in high school in the late '40s, correct?

A.   Yes.  They were in the late '20s.

Q.   And you showed the jury several marketing plans dated from the 1970s and 1980s, correct?

A.   Marketing plans?  I'm not sure what you're referring to.

Q.   You showed marketing research documents, you showed the Burrows memo, the -- the Hilton Head presentation?

A.   Yes, I did.

Q.   So marketing documents that reflected research and plans for brands dated in those decades, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=580
1949

A.   Correct.

Q.   You did not show the jury any marketing plan or research document dated in the decade of the 1930s, did you?

A.   No.

Q. And you did not show the jury any marketing plan or research document dated in the decade of the 1940s, did you?

A.   Let me just correct my answer there just to be perfectly clear.  The Diane Burrows, you know, memorandum, you know, whatever it's -- report, which is quite extensive, over 80 pages, talks about the successful brands that were marketed in the '30s, the '40s, the '50s, the '60s, the '70s and the '80s.

So the Diane Burrows does go back historically.  Even though that document was written in 1984, it's a historical review of how to get, you know, the replacement smokers and how -- which companies had been successful at doing that and why.

Q.   Let's follow up on that.  The Diane Burrows memo that was authored in 1984, in all the documents you showed the jury, did you have any other documents that even provided a retrospective look describing marketing of the '30s and '40s?

A.   Yes.  The Ted Bates, the Mr. Burghart's

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=581
1950

document from 1953 provides very detailed information, among the most detailed that I've seen, on the expenditures for marketing different brands.  It talks about the advertising themes for Camel, Lucky Strike, Chesterfield, Philip Morris, up to 1953 and drew the conclusion that we shared with the jury, which was that cigarette advertising was the -- the key factor in the rise and fall of -- of every brand up to that point.

Q. With the Diane Burrows memo, at that point in time, Reynolds and American Tobacco were not linked by a merger, correct?

A.   Well, in the early '50s, yeah, that's true.

Q.   Okay.

A.   That -- they weren't -- didn't merge in the '50s.  That's true.

Q.   And when Diane Burrows was writing in 1984 and doing a retrospective, she did not have access to her competitors' marketing documents.  She didn't know what American Tobacco Company may or may not have written in the 1930s regarding Lucky Strike, correct?

A.   I don't know what Diane Burrows -- I mean, there are references to data that she has and she did have extensive market share data of different brands that were industry internal sales data, but I can't say what, you know, internal marketing documents she might

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=582
1951

have had from American or other companies.

Q.   And Ms. Burrows cites data from the Health, Education and Welfare Department, correct?

A.   Among other sources, including Reynolds' own surveys of teenagers that they cite in their report.

Q.   And to make sure we haven't lost sight of my original question that got us here, you have not seen or shown the jury a document dated in the 1930s or dated in the 1940s from the marketing department of Reynolds, American Tobacco or Brown & Williamson, correct?

A.   No, we did.  We showed lots of ads from that period.  Those come out of the marketing period.  The "Light Smoke," you know, document you just showed on the screen was 1935, December.  That comes out of the marketing department of American Tobacco.  So we showed many documents.

Q. Those documents that you just referenced were all public, the ads were out in the public and the '35 American Tobacco, we just saw went to doctors, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   You have not shown this jury any internal secret marketing document dated in the 1930s or 1940s from any of those companies, correct?

A.   That's true.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=583
1952

Q.   You showed the jury a Flintstone --Flintstones' advertisement that included a Winston sponsorship, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the clip you showed was from 1960; right?

A.   '61, I believe.  '60 and '61 is when they had the sponsorship, and then when it went to Saturday morning syndication, Reynolds dropped the sponsorship.

Q.   So the TV show starts in the fall of 1960, continues into the spring of '61.  It's the first season of the show, correct?

A.   Correct.  Prime time.

Q.   And as you just indicated, it was on prime time evenings, not Saturday morning, correct?

A.   That's right.  It started out -- I think the premiere was 8:30 and then it ran at 7:30 in the evening.

Q.   Now, that first season of the show, that was the only season at which Reynolds advertised the Winston cigarettes, correct?

A.   Yes.  I mean, when it went to Saturday morning cartoons, Reynolds dropped the sponsorship.

Q.   And you're familiar with the publicity for the show when it was launched.  It included in places such as the New York Times describing it as the first

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=584
1953

adult comedy?

A.   Yeah.  There were other adult comedies, also, I think contained in the -- that ad from the New York Times.

Q.   And just to be clear of my question, the first adult comedy in a cartoon form?

A.   Sure.

Q.   There were certainly adult comedies prior to that?

A.   Yes, absolutely.

Q.   The other sponsor for that same season that Reynolds advertised Winston was Alka-Seltzer and One a Day vitamins, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Alka-Seltzer is a product for heartburn and indigestion, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   It's a product for adults, you can agree?

A.   Yeah, sure.  It's a medicine.  Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a relief it is.  That was Alka-Seltzer.  I remember it growing up.

Q.   And you've seen the sponsorship that ran for Alka-Seltzer on the Flintstones that same season, correct?

A.   Sure.  And One a Day vitamins as well.

Q.   Snoopy for MetLife.  For some reason, the Pink Panther for Owens-Corning, and -- and Mr. Clean. Those are examples you've seen, correct? A.   True. Q.   And you don't believe that children are

interested in buying life insurance, do you?

A.   No.

MR. CARTER:  You can pull that down, thank

you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q. You showed a number of ads during your direct examination. I'd like to talk about some of the print ads .

It was not unusual to see a celebrity or a movie star in an advertisement for a consumer product in the '40s, '50s or '60s, was it?

A.   Or even today.  Of course not.

Q.   And -- and celebrities were used to advertise a number of products during that time period beyond cigarettes, correct?

A.   Sure.  Very effective way of reaching a typically young audience who were sort of, you know, going with the fad of the in products and so on.

Q.   You talked about Lucille Ball.  You showed the clip from "The Lucy Show" advertising cigarettes, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q. Lucille Ball was a -- was a pitch woman for a number of other products, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And this is a print advertisement with Lucille Ball for Carlings Red Cap Ale, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Same thing with athletes.  Athletes were used to promote all sorts of products during this time period, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you mentioned Willie Mays as one of the gentlemen on the cigarette ad, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Willie Mays was -- was very active in promoting products, correct?

A.   Sure.

MR. CARTER:  I'd like to pull up

Demonstrative 28. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   We have an ad for support hose, red hot sauce, and a syrup, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And even today, we see the use of celebrities, movie stars and athletes in advertisements for consumer products, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=588
1957

A.   Yes.

Q.   You talked to the jury about ads that had a military or patriotic theme, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And during the war times, those themes were popular for consumer products beyond cigarettes, correct?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  I'd like to look at

Demonstrative 29. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Here, we see examples.  The one on the left, Nestle's Chocolate, is described as a fighting food, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   And the one on the right is grapefruit juice with a PT boat, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   You talked about World War I and World War II and how cigarettes were included in the soldiers' K-rations and C-rations, correct?

A.   Correct.  Plus the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

Q.   And when cigarettes made their way into the rations of soldiers, those were actually placed there

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1958

by the U.S. government and the branches of the military, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   None of the ads that you showed the jury during your presentation contains the word safe, did they?

A.   In the presentation?  No.

Q.   And isn't it true that the 1994 Surgeon General's report indicated that health claims in advertisements for cigarettes actually had the effect of increasing consumer awareness of the risks of those products?

A.   Yeah.  I think I mentioned that with the introduction of filters, Kent, Viceroy, which talked about the special filters in the early '50s, and that sort of also contributed to that dip in sales that occurred in that '53, '54 time period that was the crisis the industry was so worried about.

Q.   I'd like to show you an example of the quote from the Surgeon General of the 1994 report.

MR. CARTER:  If we could pull the callout

back on the screen, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The highlighted portion, "With greater public concern about cancer, however, these continuing health claims, although intended to reassure consumers, were likely increasing consumer awareness of the suspected health risks of smoking."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yeah, but you didn't really read the context that is the beginning part of that.

Q.   Is there another portion of this you would like to have read?

A.   Sure.  Just start right from the beginning.

Q.   All right.

MR. CARTER:  Can you pull up that first

paragraph? BY MR. CARTER:

Will you go ahead and read the portion?

"Before reports in the early 1950s began

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=591
1960

linking cancer and smoking, cigarette advertising characteristically had used explicit health claims, assertions and reassertions, such as not a cough in a carload, no throat irritation, more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette, smoking is more fun when you're not worried about throat irritation or smoker's cough."

Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

We talked about it a moment ago, but one of the marketing documents dated in the 1970s that you showed was a presentation made by a Mr. Tucker at Hilton Head, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And one of the campaigns that was described in that document that you followed up on with an additional document was a campaign for Camel filters that was titled Meet the Turk?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And there's no evidence that Mr. Barbose ever smoked a Camel filter, is there?

A.   No.

Q.   And you've seen the Meet the Turk ads that Reynolds put out in the public after that campaign was first conceived, correct?

A.   Sure.  I've seen many of the ads.  The one

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=592
1961

with Turk and the lady in the bikini on the beach was eye catching.

MR. CARTER:  Let's look at Demonstrative 37. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   These are examples of the Meet the Turk campaign that ran; right?

A.   These are some, not the one that I just mentioned.

Q.   Right.  And I was simply saying these are examples?

A.   Yeah.  I think the one that I have was from Sports Illustrated.

Q.   So the upper left, we have the Turk was the character who's depicted in all these ads, correct?

A.   That's right.  He's sort of the, you know, independent young macho.  It's the '70s.  You've got the little '70s vibe going in their ads.

Q.   And that's a good segue.  Because when you look at these ads, there are some things that look a little odd from today's standards perhaps?

A.   Sure.  But I grew up in that era.  So I recognized it pretty well.

Q.   So he's feeding a toucan, a date in the upper left, and he's down at some ruins on the lower left, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=593

A.   Right.  He's on his motorcycle there, camping out.

Q.   Now, the document that you showed about the Meet the Turk campaign specifically, that was Plaintiff's Exhibit 1836.

MR. CARTER:  Can we pull that cover page up,

please? BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This is a document you showed the jury during your presentation with Mr. Clark, correct?

A.   No.  This is not the one.  I think we showed the -- the next page of it, which is from Mr. Himes to Mr. Tucker announcing the launch of the campaign and talking about the target audience being 14- to 24-year-old males.

Q.   You read this first paragraph of this page, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   All right.  Now, you know that the document goes on to report on the test market research that they conducted in connection with this campaign, correct?

A.   Yes.  The test market had been done in '73, '74, presented to the board of directors by Mr. Tucker in December of 1974.

And then this is the document in early -- you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=594
1963

know, just in January of 1975, announcing that they're going from test market to national launch.

MR. CARTER:  And I'd like to show the jury

that test market research.  If we can look at page

4, please.

Pull up the bottom -- well, let's -- can we

highlight the top as well, Plack, thank you.

Well, before we move the date up there, move

the date down where it says test market results.

Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   So looking at the test market results, and at the bottom, it reads, "Consumer data for male smokers in test markets reveal the following.  Turk," which is the campaign we just looked at some of the ads, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   "Turk advertising is on target.  It appeals to young adult males, paren, 18 to 34." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.  But that's not everything in this document.

Q.   In 1974, Mr. Barbose was 40, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   1975, 41 when we do the math?

A.   Correct.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Ryan. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   We -- selling cigarettes has been legal the entire time that Mr. Barbose was alive, correct?

A.   No, sir.  It's illegal to sell cigarettes to minors.  It's illegal in the state of Florida to promote cigarettes to minors.

Q.   Selling cigarettes to adults over the age of 18 was legal the entire time Mr. Barbose was alive, correct?

A.   Depends what state you're in.  I believe in the state of Pennsylvania where he grew up, it was the age of either 19 or 21.  They had a different age than Florida did.

Q.   So whatever the age of majority was, as long as that was satisfied, it was legal to sell cigarettes to those individuals the entire time Mr. Barbose was alive, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And until 1971, it was legal for a cigarette company to buy advertising time on TV and run an ad, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Same thing with the radio waves?

A.   True.

Q.   After 1971, all of those broadcast advertisements were taken off the air?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Starting in 1972, the Surgeon General's warning was also required to be included on print advertisements?

A.   That's true.

Q.   You talked to the jury about Claude Teague a number of times, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You mentioned a memo that he authored in 1973, correct?

A.   Yeah, the one on marketing to youth.

Q.   And in 1973, Mr. Barbose was 39, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   By that point in time, he was married and had children?

A.   He was married, he had children and he was an addicted smoker.

MR. CARTER:  Move to strike. THE COURT:  That motion is granted. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The research planning memorandum that Mr. Teague authored does not talk about any of the brands that Mr. Barbose smoked in the 1950s or 1960s,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=597
1966

correct?

A.   It's Dr. Teague.  And no, I don't think it talks about any brands per se as I recall.

Q.   So Dr. league's memo does not discuss specific brands, correct?

A.   Not specific brands.

Q.   And because it's a research planning memoranda, it's talking about potential brands for the future, correct?

A.   It's talking about the research they need to do in order to appeal to the pre-smoker, learner, as well as hold on to the confirmed smoker, and goes into a pretty detailed discussion of how you formulate a product that would do that with specifications for nicotine and pH level of the products.

Q.   And my question was intended to be a simple one, maybe it was inartful.

It's not talking about specific brands that were on the market at the time, it's talking about plans for potential future brands, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   We've talked about the Diane Burrows memorandum from the 1980s, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   Now, at the time that was written in 1984,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=598
1967

Mr. Barbose was 50 years old?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this document was, at the time, internal to Reynolds, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   For it was part of Reynolds' advertising strategy, correct?

A.   It was their strategic focus to identify replacement smokers and capture them.

Q.   When a company advertises -- companies do not usually disseminate their advertising strategy and plans to their competitors in the marketplace, do they?

A.   I wouldn't think so.

Q.   And with respect to advertising, Philip Morris and RJR were fierce competitors?

A.   Sure.

Q.   This was one where you read from part of the document and I asked the opening line under the purpose where it talked about the 18 to 24 definition of younger adult smokers in the parenthetical.  Do you recall that?

A.   I do.

Q.   Now �

A.   I can explain the other parts of that document that talk about --

Q.
	My question was --

A.
	-- under 18.

Q.
	I'm trying to orient us all to where we are,

because I think it was a couple days ago when you did
	
that.
	


	My question was, do you recall that back and

forth
	during your testimony?

A.
	Sure .

Q.

	MR. CARTER:  Now, let's pull up the document,

BY MR.
	CARTER:

Q.
	Let's look under Roman numeral I, purpose.

I 'm no
	t going to reread it to the jury but this was the

section that we were just discussing, correct?
	
A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And if we look at the eighth page of the

docume
	nt with Bates 8469 �


	MR. CARTER:  And pull up the highlight.

BY MR.
	CARTER:

Q.
	Would you read that to the jury?  And you

don' t
	have to skip around.  Just read from the -- from

the st
	art to the end of the highlights, including the

part that's not called up.
	
A.
	Sure .

"Introduction.  RJR's consistent policy is that smoking is a matter of free, informed adult choice which the company does not seek to influence.  However, in order to plan our business, we must consider the effects those choices may have on the future of the industry.  Furthermore, if we are to compete effectively, we must recognize the imperative to know and meet the wants of those who are 18 and have already elected to smoke as well as those of older smokers.

Purpose.  This report is intended to provide additional learning on younger adult smokers aged 18 to 24 to assist RJR in optimizing its strategic position with respect to the smoker group, while competitive issues such as Philip Morris's continuing over development among 18- to 24-year-olds are a major focus of the analysis.  The broader perspective is on the overall business opportunity, which may be available to RJR through effective marketing to younger adult smokers."

Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

Now, it's not just the page that I showed to the jury back on Friday or the page that we just read here, this document includes more than 200 references to 18 to 24 smokers?

A.   Sure.  But that's not all who they talk

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=601
1970

about.  They cite their national opinion, family opinion poll, which included people from the ages of 14 to 20 years old.  That's referenced in the appendix.

And when they talked about 18-year-old smokers, it's 18 and under.  And that's very clear from the references to the appendices that you have to look at if you really wanted to fully understand the document.

Q.   And I think it is important to be very clear. I heard you to just say in their poll.  The poll that you just cited was actually not Reynolds' poll, it was the Health, Education and Welfare poll, correct?

A.   No, sir.  I was talking about the National Family Opinion Poll.  That was a Reynolds tracking poll that dates back actually into the '60s.  And in the '70s, Reynolds captured data.  It was a household survey.  They captured smoking behavior on everybody in the household from the age of 14 and older.

And when they report those results, the under-18 group, they talk about them as 18-year-old smokers.  So whenever you read this document and you see 18-year-olds and there's some wonderful figures that talk about overall market share and then the share among 18-year-old smokers, they're talking 18 and under.  And that's referencing several studies.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=602
1971

The STS study, another marketing study by Reynolds, as well as the National Family Opinion Poll that I've described.

Q.   Now, National Family Opinion, that was a separate entity that ran market research, correct?

A.   No, sir.  The National Family Opinion Poll was commissioned by R.J. Reynolds' marketing department for R.J. Reynolds.  It was their tracking poll to see, you know, which brands were selling among which segments of the smoker market.

So it was commissioned by the marketing department of R.J. Reynolds and supplied to them by R.J. Reynolds, and there are many internal documents, including the one you just showed me, the Meet the Turk campaign that was the NFO poll.

Q.   So it's your testimony that NFO, the National Family Opinion, they did not collect data apart from what the tobacco companies requested?  They never did research on other consumer products in their ordinary course?

A.   I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying they were hired, just like Roper was hired by Philip Morris, they were hired by R.J. Reynolds to supply to R.J. Reynolds data for R.J. Reynolds' marketing department. Whether they were doing research for other companies on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=603
1972

other consumer products, I don't really know.

Q.   They existed, collected research and had a menu of options the companies could subsequently purchase, and that's how Reynolds selected the data from their offerings?

A.   I know very specifically their offerings, because in the '60s, Reynolds didn't collect the data in the National Family Opinion Poll for anybody under the age of 18, and they selected deliberately in the '70s to capture information on the under-age-18 group, which was a choice, a decision by Reynolds to study that group because it was critical to the replacement smokers that are talked about in the Diane Burrows memo.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I'd move to strike as nonresponsive.  My question was about the process.

MR. CLARK:  I'll object to that, Your Honor. THE COURT:  You may approach. (At sidebar.)

MR. CLARK:  He asked an open-ended question there and he got the answer.  I'm sorry he got the answer he wasn't expecting, but that's a yes to an open-ended question.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I mean, I know you're

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=604
1973

trying to phrase your questions and lead this witness, but that was a pretty open-ended question.

MR. CARTER:  I've got one more question on this topic, and then if you want to break for lunch?

THE COURT:  Okay.  That sounds like a good idea.

MR. CLARK:  That sounds like a really good idea for us.

(End of sidebar.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Doctor, it's about lunchtime.  So I have one more question on this document.

MR. CARTER:  If we could pull that back up, Ryan, please?  Appendix B.

If we could get the whole first half of the page?  I know it's kind of hard to read. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This was a chart you showed during your direct examination, correct? A.   Correct.

Q.   And the highlighted source of the data that's used to compile that chart indicates that it's the average of HEW, Health, Education, Welfare, data

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=605
1974

reported in the adult use of tobacco surveys from 1970 and 1975.  That's the source of the data, correct? A.   That is the source.

MR. CARTER:  I'm at a good place to break, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take a break for lunch, a recess. So let's take an hour.  Does that seem to be sufficient for you-all?  If you need more time, let the Court know, okay?

It shouldn't be nearly as packed down there as it was the first couple of days that we were here.  So we will reconvene at 1 o'clock and please remember your strict instructions not to discuss this or do any further investigation on it.

We'll be in recess for one hour.

PROFFERED EXAMINATION BY MR. BIGGER:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, good -- or good afternoon. Just a few quick questions for you this morning. I'm going to bring you a document, okay? MR. BIGGER:  Is it all right if I just stay here, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes. BY MR. BIGGER:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, do you recognize this document? A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you recognize this as a Philip Morris --printout of Philip Morris USA's website? A.   Yes.

MS. YATES:  Objection, Your Honor.  Leading. MR. BIGGER:  Predicate.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule that.  Proceed. BY MR. BIGGER:

Q.   Have you had occasion to do research on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=607
1976

Phillip Morris USA's website at different times historically?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Has Philip Morris's website changed throughout the years they've had a website?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you familiar with something called the Wayback Machine?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you able -- have you used the Wayback Machine in doing your research?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Have you -- during the course of your search, have you visited Philip Morris USA's website?

A.   I have.

Q.   And have you seen changes to the website throughout the last few years?

A.   Sure.  I'm familiar with their website that went up in 1999.  I was asked about it in the original Engle trial, by the way, and how that changed in 2000, actually, October of 2000.  And some documentation between the original website that was put up where I actually wrote to the president of Philip Morris congratulating them on having accepted the fact that cigarette smoking causes disease and then coming across

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=608
1977

some materials through the Securities and Exchange Commission from lawyers representing Philip Morris who said that that had been misinterpreted.

And then they finally came around and changed their website in 2000 -- October of 2000, and that's when they first accepted the findings of the Surgeon General that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

Q.   From that time, have you continued to periodically review Philip Morris USA website?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And have you -- as you reviewed the website, do you know what's -- are you familiar with essentially the copyright indication as to the currentness of the website?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that typically contained in the bottom right-hand corner of the website?

A.   It is.

Q.   Do you see that on that document there?

A.   I do.

Q.   We have highlighted something on there that is a link.  Are you familiar with links Philip Morris puts on their website?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Have you navigated through the various links

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=609
1978

on the Philip Morris USA website?

A.   I have.

Q.   Okay.  What we have done, we've provided these documents, the printouts, and I would like you to flip through these and ask you -- ask you if you recognize them as essentially navigations through the highlighted links that we have identified in these printouts?

A.   They are, and I do recognize these, and I've seen these on the Philip Morris website.

Q.   Okay.  And the final one there, would -- can you read that for the record -- that one right there?

A.   This one right here?

Under the topic, cigarette smoking and health, the highlighted section is, "Related resource -- resources visit these sections for more information," and it references the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA statement on addiction, which was Dr. Kessler's testimony before Congress in 1995.

Q.   And then the last page there, is that what would happen if you clicked on that link, it would take you to this page?

A. Correct. This is Dr. Kessler who had given testimony before Congress in August of 1995. And he lists a variety of facts, such as 87 percent of people

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=610
1979

who smoke cigarettes, smoke every day, nearly two-thirds of smokers have their first cigarette within the first half hour after they wake up, and then it goes on with other facts.

Q.   You, in your past research have gone to this website, have clicked through those links, and you are familiar with this being a historical -- accurate historical representation of the Philip Morris USA website, at least as of 2010?

A.   Yes.  Those selected pages.  I mean, obviously, there are many, many pages. Q.   There are more?

A.   Hundreds, actually, that you could download. Q.   Thank you.

MR. BIGGER:  Nothing further, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Any cross? MS. YATES:  Nothing, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  Anything further? MR. BIGGER:  No.  We would move that FDA document into evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Any objection now with that foundation?

MS. YATES:  No further objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.  That will be admitted into evidence.

MR. BIGGER:  And what we'll do, Your Honor, is we'll just move this because this has the actual link to the slides on it, move this document into evidence.

THE COURT:  And it's identified as what?

MR. BIGGER:  PT � we'll call it PT5448A.

THE COURT:  It will be admitted into evidence.

Anything further?

MR. BIGGER:  Not from us, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Please be seated.

MR. BIGGER:  I think so.  Just one thing.

I don't know if it's possible, but if you all have like the things you're going to use --

MR. CARTER:  My best guess would be that by the time cross-examination is complete, redirect, Dr. Cummings will probably fill up a day, but that's a guess at this point.

THE COURT:  So are we shooting for 5:00, or are we going to give them advanced notice that they may be here late today?

MR. BIGGER:  I hope that they won't be here late.  I mean, certainly, if it's a situation where it's a few minutes before 5:00, Dr. Cummings is done, we can certainly just break for the day.  If

KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., plaintiff's witness herein, being previously duly sworn on oath, testified as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Welcome back, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Good afternoon.

Q.   Millions of people who have seen advertisements for cigarettes have been lifelong never smokers, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Millions of people who are nonsmokers see those ads.  And the fact there is a pretty woman in the ad or horses or nature scene, those images do not compel those nonsmokers to smoke, true?

A.   True, not everybody becomes a smoker.

Q.   And just because a person smokes a particular brand of cigarette and has seen the ads for that brand, it doesn't necessarily mean they're smoking that brand because of the ads, true?

A.   I would say untrue.  I could explain, if I like -- if you'd like.

Q.   Before you do, I'd like to show you your deposition from the Surico case.

A.   Sure.

MR. CARTER:  May I approach the witness? THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Here you are. A.   Thanks.

Q.   Doctor, if you'll turn with me to page 3278, line 17.

Are you with me? A.   Yes.

Q.   At the Surico trial last year, you were asked the following question:

"And just because a person smokes a particular brand of cigarette and has also seen ads for that brand doesn't necessarily mean that they're smoking that brand because of the ads, correct?"

And the answer you provided was, "True." Did I read that correctly? A.   You read it correctly, and I can explain the answer I just gave.  Because usually they're smoking for addiction, but the advertising certainly plays into which brands they smoke.

Q.   And the answer to my question, as you indicated both in the Surico trial and just a moment ago, is that the answer to my question was true, correct?

A.   The answer was true because you indicated "just

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=621
1990

the only" -- as in the only reason.

Q.   You testified that Mr. Barbose started smoking sometime between 1946 and 1950, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And there is testimony in this case that you reviewed that Mr. Barbose started smoking with loose cigarettes from his father's store, correct?

A.   That's correct.  From his brother.

Q.   And in terms of the age that Mr. Barbose was when that happened, the reports in the depositions vary, correct?

A.   Well, he said 14 or 16, I believe, from his brother.  That was Samuel.

And then his daughter testified that the father had told -- told her that he had started at a young age, I think 12 to 14, and then -- so there were some variation.  So in my notes, I recorded 12 to 16, since it seemed like it was in that period.

Q.   And the only witness who placed it as early as 12 was the daughter Deborah, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Ms. Barbose and Mr. Barbose's brother Sam have it at age 16, correct?

A.   I believe that's true.  Actually, Sam, I think, said 15.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=622
1991

Q. And you saw the verified worksheets in this case, correct?

A.   I did.

Q.   In the verified worksheet, Ms. Barbose swore that it was age 16, correct?

A.   She did.

Q.   Now, Sam explained that the -- he and Mr. Barbose's father had a store in Luzerne, Pennsylvania, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q. And that's where this story about the loose cigarettes being taken out of the sales area, that's where that occurred, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   You're also aware that there is testimony from Sam that he's not sure if those loose cigarettes that he saw his brother take from their father's store were the first cigarettes he smoked?

A.   That's right.  He might have been smoking before that.

Q.   And Sam testified that when Mr. Barbose's friends were on their way to school, the friends would come in and purchase cigarettes from their father's store, correct?

A.   That's right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=623
1992

Q.   And if Mr. Barbose was with them, he would take some for himself?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Regarding Mr. Barbose's initiation -- well, strike that.

Regarding initiation generally, do you agree the most important factor is whether a person's friends and family members smokes, correct?

A.   It's an important factor, yes.

Q.   And not just the important factor, you believe it's the most important factor?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mr. Barbose's father, Frances, did not just sell cigarettes, he himself was a smoker, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And as we just discussed, we know Mr. Barbose's friends were smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, in your review of the materials, you were unable to identify any specific print, broadcast, or billboard advertisements that Mr. Barbose himself saw, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you recall Ms. Barbose testified that she does not know why Mr. Barbose started smoking?  You're

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=624
1993

familiar with that testimony?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   You're familiar with the similar testimony from the brother Sam, Sam Barbose did not know why Mr. Barbose started smoking, true?

A.   That's true.  He did answer it that way, although I think he said everybody was smoking, as I recall from the testimony.

Q.   But his testimony as to whether he knew why his brother started was, he did not?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And none of the other witnesses who testified in depositions in this case provided information as to why Mr. Barbose started smoking, according to Mr. Barbose?

A.   First started.  Because I don't think anybody had awareness of his first initiation of smoking.

Q.   And Mr. Barbose never told Ms. Barbose that he started smoking because of an advertisement, did he?

A.   That's true.  She did say that.

Q.   And Sam and the other witnesses who testified said the same thing?

A.   Sure.  Most people are not aware of the effects of advertising on their purchasing habits.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I move to strike

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=625
1994

everything after the answer "Sure."

THE COURT:  The Court will grant that request

and strike that unresponsive response. Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Similarly, Mr. Barbose never told anyone who testified that he continued smoking because of cigarette advertisements, did he?

A.   True.

Q.   You saw no evidence in this case that Mr. Barbose, as an individual, saw particular statements from the Tobacco Institute, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, or the Council for Tobacco Research?

A.   Specific?

Q.   Yes.

A.   Yeah, specific ads; like, in other words, show this particular ad whether he had seen it.  But, certainly, there was testimony about him not being aware of the health risks up to a certain point.

Q. You showed a video with Bill Dwyer on the steps of Congress and someone -- it might have been one of the earliest photo bombs.

Do you remember that video?

A.   I'm not sure which photo bomb.

Q.   He's inviting people to write in if they want

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=626
1995

to get a packet from TI.

A.   That wasn't Bill Dwyer, but I'm familiar with that.  That was the "Project Truth" campaign; the one that "Doubt is our product."

Q.   Apologies if I had the name incorrect.

But there's no information in this case that Mr. Barbose ever wrote in for a Tobacco Institute brochure?

A.   Not a Tobacco Institute brochure.  I believe he was communicating with Philip Morris, to one of their promotional loyalty programs.

Q.   We'll come to that later.

I would like to switch gears and talk about specific brands at this point.

Now, on Friday, I wrote down that you testified that Winston -- the brand Winston cigarettes was reported as a brand that Mr. Barbose smoked. Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You did not provide any year or details regarding the timing of that, so I want to follow up on that.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Okay.  When did Mr. Barbose smoke Winston cigarettes?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=627
1996

A.   Well, it appears after he had moved to Florida, so after 1984 is based on the best recollection I can get from the testimony.  But he may have smoked it earlier, because I think there is testimony from his brother he smoked mainly Marlboros and -- early on --and some Winstons.

Q.   And with respect to Winston, no one testified that Winston was a regular or primary brand for Mr. Barbose over the years, correct?

A.   Well, it was mentioned as a brand repeatedly by several of the witnesses in the case, based on my review.  But, clearly, Marlboro, I think, was the number one brand.

So I don't know what you mean by "regular," but it was mentioned by all of them, so it must have been common enough for a lot of people to see it.

Q.   Let's focus on the individual.

So Ms. Barbose, she testified that she didn't know whether Marlboro -- or excuse me -- whether the Winston smoking was a week, a month, or a year, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the daughter Dyanna testified that she wasn't sure when it was, but that she thought it was after it was in Florida, correct?

A.   I believe that's correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=628
1997

Q.   And the daughter Deborah said she couldn't say how much her father smoked of that brand beyond a carton?

A.   I don't know.  She said occasionally smoking Winston and Dorals.  It's on page 73 of her depo.

Q.   Are you familiar with page 38 where she said, "Couldn't say if it was more than a carton"?

A.   No, but I don't dispute that it's there.

Q.   And the brother Sam testified that with respect to Winston, it was maybe a pack, correct?

A. He says "occasionally Winston" on page 115. I don't know what that -- I'd have to go back and look at his full testimony.

Q.   Now, you also told the jury last week that Mr. Barbose switched to lights in the 1980s.  Do you recall that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And did he, after that, ever switch away from lights?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And when did that occur?

A.   I believe there is testimony from his wife that he was smoking Dorals towards the end of his smoking in the '90s, so the Winston Lights came before the Dorals.

Q.   Now �

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=629
1998

A.   Dorals, of course, was a light brand in the '80s, but was rebranded as a discount -- branded discount product in the '90s.

Q.   Does that complete your answer?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   You're familiar with Ms. Barbose's testimony when she said that the Camel and Lucky Strike cigarettes that her husband smoked were all unfiltered, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You told the jury on Friday that Mr. Barbose's smoking history was consistent with a transition from unfiltered to filtered in the 1960s, and then on to lights in the 1980s.

Do you recall giving that testimony?

A.   I do.

Q.   Given Ms. Barbose's testimony that her husband smoked unfiltered Lucky Strikes and unfiltered Camels all the way until the '80s, how do you reconcile that difference with your opinion?

A.   That the transition of the witnesses were that he was smoking unfiltered Camel, Lucky Strikes.  Not sure it was up to the '80s, because there is conflicting testimony that he -- in fact, his brother says he was smoking a filtered Marlboro cigarette the time of his graduation.  And, occasionally, a Winston cigarette.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=630
1999

But he certainly went from the unfiltered to the filtered, so that would be Marlboro, Winston, or any of the other brands afterwards that were filtered, to Marlboro Lights, and then the Dorals.

Q.   In preparation for this case, you prepared two sets of notes reflecting your analysis of the case materials you reviewed, correct?

A.   No, sir.

Q.   You did not prepare two sets of notes?

A.   No, just one set of notes.  I have them right here, if you'd like.

Q.   Do you recall the prior set that was marked at your deposition before you had received the materials from Mr. Derhammer and the mediation -- or, excuse me --the verified worksheets?

A.   I don't know.  I mean, I have to go back.  It was July.  I think I was � July 1st is when I was deposed.

Q.   In any event, you have a current set of your notes that you've had with you up on the stand?

A.   Yes, it's the only set.  When I went and was preparing for the case, I printed out the notes that I had prepared in advance of my deposition and been questioned about for a number of hours.  And it's the same set of notes.  There were no dual set of notes.  So

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

I guess I'm curious what you're referring to.

Q.   All right.  With respect to the notes that you have in front of you, they're dated June 29th, 2015, correct?

A.   There is no date on them.

MR. CARTER:  Can we pull up Deposition Exhibit 5, please.  Before we do, may I have a copy? May I approach? THE COURT:  You may. THE WITNESS:  Thanks. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   You're welcome.

All right. Can we pull up -- you see this is a copy of your notes that was marked at your deposition in this case, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the top has a date, "June 29th, 2005"? A.   That's right.

Q.   And those notes are the same content that you've had with you on the stand throughout your testimony, correct? A.   Yes. Q.   Now �

MR. CARTER:  Pull that down, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=632
2001

Q.   I would like to pull up Demonstrative 38, which pulls up a section of your notes that was highlighted --

A.   Okay.

Q.   -- and I want to focus on that.

Now, in the background section, you provided a description of the brand history based on your analysis, correct?

A.   Based on the verified worksheets.

Q.   All right.  Would you read the two bullets that are on page 1 of your reports in the background section describing the brand usage?

A.   The two bullets below?

Q.   Yes.

A.   It says, "Camel and Lucky Strikes from 1950 to 1984; Marlboro, 1984, 1993; Doral, 1993, 1996.  Also would occasionally smoke other brands, Chesterfield, Pall Mall, L & M, Kool, Salem, Winston, Kent.

Q.   And so on page 1 of your notes as you recorded, based on your review of materials in this case, there is no mention in your notes of an un- or excuse me � of a filtered cigarette being smoked prior to 1984, at least according to what you've written there?

A.   Certainly, there is in my notes, because I also have detailed notes on the depositions from all of the individuals that I reviewed their depositions.  So that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=633
2002

would be untrue.  All this is, as I indicated, is what came out of the verified worksheet.

So I'm just recording that, and then I reviewed some medical records, took notes from each of the depositions that I was asked to review, and I recorded those notes and the brand histories where the family members were asked questions about the brand histories of Mr. Barbose.  And I reported that as well.

Q.   On page 1 of your notes, under the section "Background," this is the extent to what you wrote down regarding brand usage, correct?

A.   No, sir.

Q.   All right.

A.   On page 1 of my notes, I mean, you've got --I've got 30-some-odd � 36 pages of notes, but �

Q.   And my question was what's on page 1.

A.   Sure.  But I don't rely on just page 1.  I rely on the totality of all the information I get.  It's in a verified worksheet.  It's just sort of a beginning point.  And then you go look at the deposition testimony to compare it.

Q.   Again, be that as it may, my question, I'm just asking you what's on page 1.

A.   Sure.

Q.   And we've established that the only thing on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=634
2003

page 1 is what's displayed on the screen with respect to brands?

A.   Right.

Q.   You have other pages of notes that follow, correct?

A.   Right.  I was asked about all those pages in my deposition.

Q.   Thank you.

With respect to the story, you told the jury last week about the progression from unfiltered to filtered.  Did you discount Ms. Barbose's testimony that the filtered cigarettes did not start until 1985?

A.   I took account of the totality of testimony that I reviewed from all of the fact witnesses that --for whom I was given depositions, yeah.  And so it seemed to be there was other evidence that suggested he was smoking a filtered cigarette sooner.

Q.   So on that issue, in your expert opinion, the testimony of Ms. Barbose was not consistent with your opinion?

A.   Was not consistent in her own testimony.  I think she was asked about it and wasn't entirely clear of the dates, as one might imagine, if you're going back 50 years or longer to ask somebody about what brands of cigarettes somebody else might have been using.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=635
2004

Q.   In the verified worksheets that you reviewed and that you say became the content for that section of your notes, you didn't see anywhere in that verified worksheet where Ms. Barbose indicated that she was uncertain as to the dates; she actually provided the specific dates that the jury just saw?

A.   Yeah.  The verified worksheets, I think, speak for themselves as to all the other materials.  You take account of it and, you know, you compare to see what the story is as best you can piece it together from all of the information.

Q.   Changing gears.

Dr. Cummings, you've described yourself as an antitobacco advocate previously, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   You have written an article entitled "The War on Tobacco," right?

A.   Right, in the journal "Cancer."

Q.   And you have been described as "a general in the war on tobacco," correct?

A.   I have.  I think the Buffalo News featured me sitting atop the mound of tobacco documents, and they said, "The general on the war on cancer."

But I've been a foot soldier, I guess, for most of my life.

Q.   You have testified in the past that you believe you're in a war against tobacco companies, correct?

A.   Unfortunately, yes.

Q.   In testifying in cases like these, you believe that you're bringing the war against tobacco into the courtroom, don't you?

A.   Obviously, I am.  And I feel an obligation, given the unique experience I have in documents that happened to fall into my lap.  And I have unique knowledge to share that a lot of people in my position don't have.

Q.   You agree that cigarettes are a legal product today, correct?

A.   I don't.  They're a legal product for adults, but not for kids.

Q.   You would like to have cigarettes banned for all ages, correct?

A.   What I've said is, I would prefer that the cigarette companies find another way to make money and they don't have to sell a defective product that kills one out of two people.  So, yeah, get rid of the cigarettes.

Q.   You've testified that you think cigarettes should be banned, correct?

A.   I don't think it's feasible for the government

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

to ban it, but there is nothing preventing your client from discontinuing the sale and putting the public's health above all other considerations of their business, as they promised to do back in 1954.

Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, I believe you told the jury you've testified as an expert in litigation against tobacco companies since approximately 1996?

A.   True.

Q.   And that's over 18 years?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   You've given testimony in more than 120 depositions?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You've testified that providing in-court testimony against cigarette companies has become a sort of a second job for you?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And your litigation work with plaintiffs' attorneys has provided 60 percent of your income from all sources in 2011, 2012, and 2013?

outside the hearing of the jury:)

MR. CARTER:  Judge, I believe the witness was about to say that the retainer is donated to a fund that he sets up as part of a charity.  This is something that has been excluded in cases routinely. I'm not aware of it coming in over any objection when the objection has been made.  It's improper character evidence.  What he does with the money, where he directs the money is not relevant and would violate the Florida rules of evidence.  So I think we should stop that as to where the money goes.

MR. CLARK:  Number one, the retainer is separate and distinct.  He charges that.  So the jury is going to be misled as to the true financial arrangements.  So if we're going to talk about how much money he makes and how much he charges and what he charges for, we've already split out how much he

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=641
2010

charges for different services.

THE COURT:  The retainer is part of the million dollars?

MR. CARTER:  It's actually � it was changed in the last year or so when he moved down to the Medical University of South Carolina.  The number I'm about to show were when the retainer was going to him.  This was a subsequent move that he made in changing his fees.  And my understanding from the deposition in this case was, as of the deposition, he hadn't even paid a retainer in this case.  And that's why I wasn't going ask him about the retainer at all.  I was just going to ask about the changes.

MR. CLARK:  If we're going to talk about his charges, then we're going to talk about all his charges.  I think that's only fair.  I don't think we get to pick and choose the parts that are beneficial and we don't get to talk about it all.

THE COURT:  You're representing to the Court that this retainer is not part of this million dollars that he has received since the beginning of time?

MR. CARTER:  I'm going to walk through a time line of, I believe, starting with 2011 -- '12, '13, '14 -- he's made over a million and a quarter just

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=642
2011

in those four or five years.  It's not just over the 20 years.  And this policy regarding the retainer, my understanding is that that switched at some point last year during the federal cases and that the practice part of the retainer was different prior to that time.  So the calculations, whether it's 2010 or '11, whatever is in my outline, those -- that was a different practice with the retainer.  The retainer wasn't going to a separate fund.

If they want to get into the fact that he charges a retainer and that he doesn't keep it and -- maybe there's some way Your Honor can hold the line as to whether it becomes improper character evidence.  But testifying that he donates something to charity, that's immaterial what he does with the money.  The fact that he has the money and then gets to redirect it -- you know, it's the amount of money he receives.  What he then does with it, whether he buys a car or gives it to charity, that's improper character evidence.

THE COURT:  What charity?

MR. CLARK:  Well, it's not a charity.  What it is, is he donates that part of that retainer into a fund that is used to provide for nicotine replacement therapy to smokers that are treated by

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=643
2012

his employer at the Medical University of South Carolina.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And this is separate from the million dollars that we have already gone into. I think you've opened the door by going there if there is some other separate account.

MR. CARTER:  I'm going to ask about the years before that was his practice.  His first years he was at Buffalo at Roswell Park.  There wasn't a Medical University of South Carolina.  There wasn't this fund.  So this was a practice.  If there's actually a bigger history than this, I'm not going into, because his billing rate used to be $500 for each and he used to have an in-kind donation that he required plaintiff's counsel to make.

All I'm asking was, What was your billing hour rate now?  What is your billing rate for depositions?  And then I'm going to walk him through his money.  I'm not -- think I've been very careful at not getting into what he does with his money because I don't -- first of all, I don't think I opened the door to that because it's improper character evidence.  You can't open the door to something that's violative of the evidentiary rules.

MS. YATES:  For us, Your Honor, if he chose to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=644
2013

go spend it on a flashy car, we wouldn't be permitted to do that.  But recently he changed, and I think it's pretty obvious why, to try and impede the amount of money he's made with the statistics leading up to that point, and I similarly don't remember him being charged a retainer in this case. So it's irrelevant in this case.  Maybe he's since paid money.

THE COURT:  I'm going to reserve ruling until the break on this, because I don't -- I assume that you will not be going into the retainer, that you'll �

MR. CARTER:  I understand.  That's correct. I'm not going to ask about the retainer.

THE COURT:  I don't have to deal with this right now.  I'm going to give that some thought.  I need some more information.

MR. CARTER:  Okay.  Thank you, Judge.

MS. YATES:  Thank you. (End of bench conference.)

MR. CARTER:  May I continue, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Doctor, going back to 2010, in that calendar

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=645
2014

year, you were paid approximately $200,000 for your work in these cases, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   In 2011, you were paid more than $225,000, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In 2012, you were paid more than $200,000, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In 2013, you made somewhere between 250 and $300,000, correct?

A.   That is correct.

Q.   And last year, you made approximately 200,000, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   So in those five years alone, that amounts to a little more than $1.2 million, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In addition to testifying, you have participated in conferences where plaintiff lawyers attend and develop strategies for suing tobacco companies, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   For example, you participated in a conference that was held in Boston in 2002, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=646
2015

A.   That's right.  I was invited to give two lectures there.

Q.   The title of the conference was How to Win a Just Tobacco Verdict, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And in your mind, as you've testified, a just tobacco verdict is one in which a plaintiff wins a large verdict, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you were a speaker at that conference, as you indicated?

A.   I gave two talks.  One on the evidence around the Frank Statement and the failed promises of the companies.  And then the other was on the tobacco advertising archive that I had accumulated. Yes, I gave those two lectures.

Q.   And at that meeting in Boston, you encountered a number of attorneys who represent plaintiffs in these cases in Florida who subsequently retained you as a witness, correct?

A.   Well, I think there was one or two lawyers from Florida at that conference, not many as I recall. Mostly they were from other places.  And then there were a lot of law students because it was at the Northeastern College of Law up in Boston.  And then there were also

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=647
2016

public health officials that were there.  So there were a variety of people.  I think there were two attorneys that I recall from Florida at the time.

Q.   Two attorneys that you subsequently worked for, correct?

A.   They subsequently hired me.  Yes, I've worked with them.

Q.   Yes or no, you admit that you have a significant bias against the tobacco companies?

A.   Yes.  It's on acquired bias.  I didn't start out that way.  But based on the knowledge and experience I've acquired, I would think anybody would have a bias.

Q.   In the past, you've said that you were rooting for plaintiffs to win in lawsuits, corrected?

A.   I believe that would be a just verdict.

Q.   Switching gears back to Mr. Barbose, Mr. Barbose was intelligent, as described in the depositions, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He's described as a very hard worker.

A.   Extremely hard worker.

Q.   He was described as an entrepreneur who had a number of successful small businesses.

A.   Yes.

Q.   There is no testimony in the record that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=648
2017

Mr. Barbose was a regular, daily smoker before he graduated high school, correct?

A.   That's true.  He was from his brother.  His brother says he's smoking regularly by the time he's finishing high school because he's got the money to buy the cigarettes on his own.

Q.   According to his brother Sam, after his brother, Mr. Barbose, graduated high school and started working, that's the time period where Sam recalls his brother smoking daily.

A.   That's the time period he recalls.  He might have been smoking daily earlier, but clearly by that time, that's true.

Q.   In 19- -- that would have been 1953 when he graduated high school, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And it's that point in time, when Mr. Barbose was age 18, that you are willing and able to opine Mr. Barbose was first addicted, correct?

A.   I think when he graduated high school, I think he was 17.

Q.   So at the time that he graduated high school and started working in and became a regular daily smoker, that is the first point in time that you're able to opine to this jury that Mr. Barbose was addicted,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=649
2018

correct?

A.   Yes.  I would count somebody who is a persistent daily user as an addicted smoker.  Clearly he's addicted by the testimony from his brother at that time .

Q.   I want to talk to you about Mr. Barbose's medical records that you reviewed.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Those are one of the sources that you consulted where you saw information describing his smoking history, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   And you summarized those in the same notes that the jury saw a moment ago and that you have with you on the stand, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The information that you summarized from his medical history estimates 40 to 50 pack-years, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And �

A.   Actually it says over 50 pack-years, to be precise.

Q.   And the lower bound is 40, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And so those came from the medical records of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=650
2019

Dr. Zimmerman, Dr. Stein, and physicians at the VA hospital, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q. All together, I think there were eight or nine records describing various amounts of the pack history, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q. And other than the one from Dr. Stein that says over 50 pack-years, all of the rest have it at either 40 or some amount between 40 and 50, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The records also indicate that Mr. Barbose quit smoking in April of 1996 and remained abstinent afterwards, correct?

A.   By all indications, that's correct.

Q.   And the time period as to precisely when in April of '96 he quit varies, but it varies between one to three weeks prior to his diagnosis, correct?

A.   It's -- I believe all of the April 30th records indicate that he had quit about a week before.  And then when you look at the May records, May 7th, they're talking about one to three weeks before.  So they sort of are consistent that he quit just prior to the time he went to the doctor.  And that's consistent with testimony from family members, because he was so sick at

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=651
2020

that time.  He was having some problems that led him to go to the doctor.

Q.   Whenever it was precisely, as you indicated, the medical records are consistent that he stopped at some point a week or more prior to his diagnosis, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   One of the records, the Dr. Zimmerman record from April 30th of '96, also describes a seven-month quit that dates back to 1994, correct?

A.   Yeah.  He says, "He did stop for a period of seven months in '94.  However, he restarted again."

MR. CARTER:  I'd like to pull up that medical

record and show it to the jury.  May I have the

April 30th record?  If we could pull up the smoking

history section, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   You see where it's highlighted.  This is under the patient's social history from Dr. Zimmerman, correct, Doctor?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the highlighted portion reads, "He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 40 years.  He did stop for a period of seven months in 1994, however, restarted again."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=652
2021

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Ryan. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The verified worksheet that you reviewed also reports a quit, but it reports one in 1993 and a duration of between three to six months, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, none of the medical records that you reviewed included a formal diagnosis of addiction, do they?

A.   What do you mean by formal?

Q.   In the medical records describing the smoking history from 1996 that we saw, did a doctor write under the diagnosis or the impression section, tobacco abuse, nicotine addiction?

A.   No, they didn't do that.  They certainly described his smoking behavior as one of a persistent daily user over decades consistently, which would be --if you were looking for a diagnosis, that's what you would be looking for.

Q.   None of the medical records reflect a prior history of nicotine gum usage.

A.   No.

Q.   You talked to the jury about the 1988

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=653
2022

Surgeon General's report earlier today, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   That was the report on addiction, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And in that report, the Surgeon General discusses not only nicotine addiction and the definition, also it talks about people who try to quit. And it gives some specific -- excuse me -- some scientific information about those quit attempts, correct?

A.   I'm not sure what you're referring to.

Q.   I'll try to clarify that.  One of the things the Surgeon General discusses in that report is the public health community's view as to a serious quit attempt.

A.   Sure.

Q.   And in that report, the Surgeon General defined a serious quit attempt as one lasting 24 hours or longer, correct?

A.   I'm not sure if they used -- they used the term "serious quit attempt" at 24 hours or longer.  So you can see that.  But it's mainly used because it's a way of asking a question in a survey.  So in the last year, have you quit for 24 hours or longer?  So that's what gets recorded.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=654
2023

I'm familiar with studies that have looked at people didn't make a day, which is very common, by the way, particularly for heavily -- addicted smokers.

Q. So in the '88 report, when they are describing the criteria for a quit attempt, to classify as a quit, they report a definition that includes a requirement of 24 hours of abstinence, correct?

A.   No.  I mean, to characterize that report as saying, This is the only way we count quit attempts is you've got to quit for at least 24 hours, would be a complete misrepresentation of the scientific evidence. So I would answer no to that.

Q.   All right.

A. You can find the 24-hour quit. They do label it serious quit attempts. And it's there because it's something that could be counted in surveys.

Q.   And I don't know that I agree with the characterization.  So let's move past that.

A.   I could give you the explanation and the research that backs up that characterization if you'd like.

Q.   I'd like to just make sure that my question is answered.  In the '88 report, it describes a classification for counting a quit and, in that description, it has a threshold requirement of 24 hours

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=655
2024

That's in the '88 report, correct?

MR. CLARK:  Asked and answered, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Overrule the objection.  I think

there is still some confusion.

THE WITNESS:  Sure.  You can find that in the

report, based on what I just said. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Based on your review of the record evidence, you agree that Mr. Barbose made no effort to quit smoking in the 1950s, don't you?

A.   Based on -- I think we went through this earlier today.  And, yes, I had said that I didn't find any evidence that he had quit in the '50s.

Q.   And when we were talking about the motivation questions earlier -- I'll summarize it.  With respect to whether there is a reported effort to quit, nothing that we see prior to what you described earlier in the mid '80s?

A.   That's true.  Actually early '80s.  I think the daughters mention '80s.  I'm not sure they're just focused on the late '80s as you've indicated.

So in the '80s, he's making quit attempts, and there's -- they're recalling it.  They don't know date and hour.

Q.   We talked about motivation and we talked about

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=656
2025

whether it actually happened.  You agree that Mr. Barbose was capable of quitting in the 1950s?

A.   Capable of making a quit attempt.

Q.   And capable of making a quit attempt in the 1 60s and '70s as well?

A. Sure. If he had gotten the right information, I think he would have.  He was an intelligent person.

Q.   And during those decades that Mr. Barbose did not make a quit attempt based on what's reported, millions of Americans did quit, correct?

A.   Millions did, millions did not.  Millions died.

Q.   In connection with the efforts to quit smoking that Mr. Barbose did make starting in the 1980s, there is no report of him ever throwing away his matches or lighters or ashtrays in connection with a quit attempt, is there?

A.   Of those items, I think you're correct.  The cigarettes, there was evidence that he threw those out.

Q. And in Ms. Barbose's deposition, she -- you're familiar with her testimony that he never threw out his cigarettes in an effort to quit, correct?

A.   That's incorrect.  She actually, I think, commented, as I'm recalling -- maybe I've got the wrong individual.  But as I recall, she mentioned he threw out the Winstons and Salems, I believe, in a quit attempt.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=657
2026

Yeah, here it is.  She recalls him throwing out Winstons or Salems, thought he was smoking too much.  And that's on page 211.

Q.   Just to be clear, that's the one time Ms. Barbose testified that her husband threw cigarettes away.  But notwithstanding that, you agree that it was not in an attempt to quit, don't you?

A.   Well, usually that's when you throw your cigarettes out, but --

Q.   If you turn -- if you'd turn to page 126 of your deposition, please. A.   Okay. Q.   Starting at line 19.

MR. CLARK:  What page? MR. CARTER:  Page 126, line 19. THE WITNESS:  Okay. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   You were asked the question at your deposition in this case.

"Question:  And that's the one time she says he threw cigarettes away, and it was not in an attempt to quit?  Do you agree with that? "Answer:  True."

That was the testimony you provided in this case, deposition, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=658
2027

A.   Yes, I did say that.  I think I was responding to the first part of the question, the one time she said he threw out the cigarettes.

Q.   And then the next question was, "So you -- so do you agree that there's no evidence that Mr. Barbose ever threw away his cigarettes in an attempt to quit smoking?

"Answer:  Yes."

That was your testimony?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Before we went there, I asked about matches, lighters, and ashtrays.  No evidence of that in a quit attempt, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   No evidence that Mr. Barbose ever set a date for quitting, correct?

A.   Not that I'm recalling.  I mean, he was using the nicotine patch and -- but I'm not sure that there was a specific date like a New Year's resolution or anything like that.

Q.   No evidence he asked his social friends for help quitting, is there?

A.   No.

Q.   No evidence he joined a smoking cessation group, is there?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=659
2028

A.   No.  He didn't go to a stop-smoking group that the family recalls.

Q.   And he did not call a quitline like the one you operated in New York, correct?

A.   It pretty much didn't exist until we set up our quitline in the late '90s.

Q.   No evidence that he asked family members for assistance in quitting, is there?

A.   No.  I mean, he was getting hard candies and toothpicks.  That's how the family knew he was trying to quit.

Q.   So the answer to my question, no evidence he asked a family member for help?

A.   You can ask the family members whether they helped him or not.

Q.   So sitting there today, you don't recall one way or the other?

A.   No.  I recall that they recall quit attempts, that he was making quit attempts, that they recall that they were serious and that he was determined and that he failed.

Q.   You recall testimony that Mr. Barbose enjoyed smoking, don't you?

A.   I don't think so.

Q.   Sorry.  Was that an "I think so" or "I don't

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

think so"?

A.   I do not think so.

Q.   Okay.  Would you refer to page 68 of your deposition, please?

A.   Sure.  I was going to refer to my notes to see if I had recorded it because it's one of the things that I tend to record.

Q.   If you'd like the opportunity to review your notes first, I'm happy to give you that.

A.   Sure.

Okay.  Go ahead.  I've reviewed them.

Q.   So you recall that there is testimony in the case that Mr. Barbose enjoyed smoking, correct?

A.   I mean, I was asked that question.  I said, I do but not specifically whom, where, and when in the context.

And then, Do you -- it was asked, Do you recall the testimony about him smoking and enjoying a cigarette with coffee?  And I said it would be helpful for you to direct me to the notes that you've got the place.  I was asking for a refreshment of my memory.  And actually that's the context.

So I don't really recall it, to be honest with you.  So that's what I said here and I would stand by that.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

Q.   All right.  So you had your notes with you at

the deposition.  We've established that, correct? A.   That's true. Q.   And you had the opportunity to review your

notes and answer the questions however you saw fit,

correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And when you were asked in your deposition if

there was testimony that Mr. Barbose enjoyed smoking,

you said you recalled that, but that you didn't recall

the particular circumstances, correct?

MR. CLARK:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is improper impeachment.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  The answer is I didn't really recall.  I was asking for -- to be directed to testimony which I was not directed to, as I recall from the deposition.  And as I've reviewed the statements from family members, it doesn't appear that he enjoyed it.  In fact, he talks about regretting having ever picked up a cigarette to start with.

A.   I don't recall that specifically.

Q.   All right.  Let's look two pages beyond in your deposition, at page 70, please, starting at line 19. Let me know when you're there.

A.   Okay.

Q.   "Question:  Do you recall seeing testimony that Mr. Barbose enjoyed smoking after meals? "Answer:  Yes."

Those were the question and the answer you provided at your deposition, correct?

A.   Right.  And I may have misspoken at that deposition.  It would be best to look at the actual words from family members.

Q.   And that's not something you told us at the deposition.

A.   You wouldn't want to manufacture -- I always say, Don't rely on me; don't manufacture evidence.

Q.   So your advice is don't rely on you?

A.   I would say rely on the questions about whether a family member says they enjoyed -- he enjoyed it or not, go right to the testimony from the family member, not relying on my memory.  That's what I said at that time .

Q.   The jury has heard some about nicotine patches The patch first became available for prescription in 1992, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   It was not available over the counter until ' 96, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you saw evidence in the record of a note for a nicotine patch that Ms. Barbose found in her husband's drawer after he passed, correct?

A.   Okay.

Q.   "Question:  Do you know if Mr. Barbose actually used the patch in 1995 after it was prescribed for him? "Answer:  No."

That was the testimony you provided at your deposition, correct?

A.   Yeah, but not the full context.  It talks about the family members recalling that, him using the patch.

Q.   But that was the answer you provided to the question that I just asked, correct?

A.   Just that question.  You'd have to read the full context.

Q.   That was the only question I asked today, respectfully.

A.   If that's all you want to ask, that's fine.

MR. CLARK:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

MR. CLARK:  This is the reason why I made the objection on the improper impeachment, because what counsel is doing, number one, is he's taking the snippets out of the deposition and he's asking a question that's slightly different than what's in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

the deposition.  I realize Your Honor doesn't have a copy of the deposition up here.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I'm happy to �

MR. CLARK:  Let me finish.  Let me finish, please.

MR. CARTER:  Sorry.

MR. CLARK:  And so what's happening is because he's taking these statements slightly, slightly changing it from the way they appear in the deposition, he's creating a situation where it's turning into on argument between him and the witness.  So it's become -- it's misleading.  It's improper impeachment.  And it's also becoming argumentative.

MR. CARTER:  Let me just say for record purposes, I've been very careful.  I've been actually reading the questions from the deposition before I impeach.  So they're not slightly twisted. They are verbatim.  And so I'm happy to give Your Honor -- I can give Your Honor a copy of every transcript before I impeach from here on out.  I have no problem doing that.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  Let me have a copy of the deposition.  I think the witness is handling himself fine.  You'll have an opportunity on redirect to

address this.  If there comes to the Court's attention that there is something else in the deposition that's inconsistent, then I'll have to deal with that.  But I haven't heard that.

MR. CLARK:  Understand.

THE COURT:  So let me have the transcript so I can �

MR. CARTER:  I'll be happy to.

THE COURT:  So I'll overrule the objection.

THE BAILIFF:  Judge, we have one juror --

THE COURT:  Oh, the restroom?  Okay.

(End of bench conference.)

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, do we need to break now for the restroom?

THE COURT:  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I thought � yeah.  Let's go ahead and take a 15-minute break. This would be a good time to do that.  So we'll take a break for 15 minutes.  Court will be in recess. The jurors are still under the same restrictions. Thank you.

after -- sounds, if I'm hearing correctly, maybe a few minutes after 5:00 before the jury finishes up, you might want to let them know that.  You certainly can.  But he has a flight, so we certainly need to get him on the road at some point before too much after 5:00 so he gets back in time.

Q.   Doctor, we left off, you were talking about the nicotine patch of Mr. Barbose.  The medical record that you saw in the files that Mrs. Barbose found in the drawer, that was a 1995 prescription by a Dr. Wirt, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q. And you're not aware of any other prescription for a nicotine patch anywhere in the case materials you have reviewed, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=670
2039

A.   Well, there's mention of a nicotine patch which was only on prescription from Ms. Barbose, and I believe one of the daughters mentioned it as well.  But nothing in the medical record other than the record from Dr. Wirt.

Q.   And that was my question; the only medical document we have describing the patch is the Dr. Wirt note?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And there is no evidence that that Dr. Wirt prescription was filled, because it was in the -- found in the drawer, correct?

A.   That's true.  That particular prescription, we don't know.  That was a 1995 record.  I think the evidence of him using the patch was sooner.

Q.   As to the '95 record, the only one we have, we don't know?

A.   Correct.  As I -- for the medical record, that's true.  That was a '95 record.  There is testimony of him making an extended quit, and there is actually a reference to the extended quit earlier on, 1994, '93 period.

Q.   After -- I want to move back in time.

A.   Using the patch, by the way, that's the reference from the family members.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=671
2040

Q.   The medical record doesn't describe it?

A.   No, the medical record doesn't go into that level of detail on it.

Q.   It's not just the lack of going into detail; it doesn't mention it, correct?

A.   Well, it mentions a seven-month quit attempt in '94 that he returned to smoking again.  There is the prescription record from '95 from Dr. Wirt, and then there is testimony from family members about an extended quit in the '93-'94 period which involved the nicotine patch.

Q.   I want to go back in time.

1964, when Mr. Barbose and Ms. Barbose built their new home, the only place Mr. Barbose smoked in that home or the home subsequent was inside the bathroom, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   He would not smoke in other people's homes if they did not want him to, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   He did not smoke in his mother's house?

A.   That's my understanding, yes.

Q.   He would not smoke in the house of his daughter Dyanna?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=672
2041

Q.   The testimony is that he also avoided smoking in certain areas of his businesses, correct?

A.   When he had to, yes.

Q.   For example, he would not smoke in the retail area of the Beef Barn?

A.   Correct.

Q.   He wouldn't smoke at the counter when he was at his deli?

A.   True.

Q.   There is no evidence that Mr. Barbose -- his ability to go to work and perform his duties at work was impaired by an attempt to quit, is there?

A.   Well, he was still at work.  I think family members mentioned that when he was quitting, he was pretty irritable and short-tempered.

Q.   So did Mr. Barbose's quitting smoking or attempting to quit ever interfere with his ability to go to work?

A.   Not to go to work, no.

Q.   And you agree that there is no evidence Mr. Barbose would get up at night to smoke?

A.   No evidence, no.

Q.   Switching topics.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You would agree, won't you, that cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=673
2042

smoking has been one of the most studied causes of human disease in history?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And no health issue has received more attention from the U.S. Surgeon General than cigarette smoking, true?

A.   True.

Q.   In fact, the dangers of smoking have been discussed by the media in this country for over a hundred years?

A. Well, you can find references in media for over a hundred years, but clearly, that really begins to ramp up from the 1950s on.

Q.   And my question wasn't, respectfully, when it ramped up.  There are references back 100 years?

A.   You can find odd references back a hundred years, yeah, sure.

Q. In fact -- sorry. Didn't mean to step over you there.

The fact that cigarettes contain nicotine has also been known for a long time, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q. I believe you talked about Christopher Columbus on direct, correct?

A.   I don't believe we talked about Christopher

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=674
2043

Columbus, but --

Q.   It's been known that nicotine is in tobacco going back hundreds of years, correct?

A.   Yes.  In the 1820s, I believe, is when it was isolated.

Q.   And it has been known for some time that once someone starts to smoke, it can be difficult to quit?

A.   Yes, I did say that.

Q.   Smoking has been referred to as addictive or as an addiction for more than 100 years, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q. When Christopher Columbus and his sailors were going back to Europe, Columbus observed many of his men had a hard time giving up tobacco?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And that was more than 500 years ago?

A.   Sure.

Q. The Christopher Columbus anecdotes is reported by the Surgeon General as well, correct?

A.   Yes.  There are a bunch of those anecdotes reported in the Surgeon General's reports.

Q.   Mark Twain is one of the most famous American authors, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And he said that quitting smoking is easy, I've

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=675
2044

done it hundreds of times, correct?

A.   I think I said "a thousand times," but, yeah, he made that statement.

Q.   And a joke is only a good joke if the people you're telling it to understand what you're saying?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And it was not a secret that it could be hard to quit smoking even in the 1800s?

A.   Well, there wasn't a lot of smoking in the 1800s, but certainly you would get addicted to nicotine in tobacco and other forms -- cigars, pipes.  And, yeah, it would be hard to quit.  And once you try to stop, people have recognized that it's hard to stop.  And that goes back to the 1800s.

Q.   We talked about the Florida Health Notes.  I would like to show one to the jury.

MR. CARTER:  But before we do, I would like to

pull up AHL-32, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, you're familiar with this 1936 Florida Health Notes, correct?

A.   I am.  It's important to see the entire set of paragraphs.  I think there are just three.

Q.   And we can read from more.  Before we do, will you read the section I've called out, please?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=676
2045

A.   Sure, just the highlighted section there?

Q.   Yes, please.

A.   "To-day, the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction."

Q.   So � and this is dated 1906, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Over a hundred years ago?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Apparently, before Florida -- at least the people who did the health notes -- knew how to spell the word "today," they knew that cigarette smoking was looked on as the worst form of tobacco addiction, correct?

A.   Yes, this is a reprint of a Reverend Hammond's comments on tobacco, and it's talking about how they're being produced in opium dens and laced with all kinds of things and scrapings, and spit out tobacco is used and wrapped up in paper and used.  And that's why they're talking about it as a disgusting, vile form of tobacco.

I would agree with the description.  You have to read the whole description to have a context for the first sentence.

Q.   Let's do that.  I would like to give you a full copy.

A.   Sure.

Q.   I invite you to publish the portion you were just referencing.

A.   I'll just read the whole thing.  It's very brief.

Q.   Please proceed, Doctor.

A.   Sure.  It's on page 10 of the document.  It's labeled "Cigarettes and the Boys."

"To-day, the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction.  It is so cheap, it is so generally inhaled, it is often so loaded with drugs and so many times made from cigar stumps and street scrapings that there is every argument against its use.  Reverend James L. Hammond tells what he saw in a San Francisco opium den.  In a room not more than 20 feet square down three stories underground, dimly lighted and dingy where the air was so foul it was almost overcame you as you stood in the entrance.

"I found 12 China men busy at work sitting flat on the floor in the midst of indescribable filth.  They were rolling cigarettes from the American -- for the American boy to smoke.  There was a great pile of material in one corner of the room.  And we struck a match and stopped down to examine it.  We found it was cigar stumps and squids of tobacco mixed with the vilest of sewer excretions."

Q.   Does that complete the passage you wanted to read?

A.   It's not the passage.  That's the entire article.

Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

A.   Sure.

Q.   And the entire article starts off with the passage that we read on the screen?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   You're aware a number of states banned cigarettes around the turn of the 20th century, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And in 1899, the state of Florida was one of them?

A.   Yes, they were.

Q.   After a short period of time, that prohibition was rescinded?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I would like to look at another Florida Health Note.  This one is from 1912.

MR. CARTER:  If I could have AHL-34. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Here, Doctor, will you read what's up on the screen?

A.   Sure.  "Florida State Board of Health,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=679
2048

September 1912.  Public decided for no smoking."

And then there is an excerpt here.  "There has always been quite a number of very decent people who could not understand why they should be forced to submit to the stench of coffin nails, et cetera, simply because a minority of smokers assumed the right to pollute the air in this way."

Q.   Doctor, I want to focus on the reference to coffin nails.  Coffin nails is slang term for cigarettes, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the idea being a cigarette is another nail in one's coffin?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So Florida, here, calling cigarettes coffin nails more than a hundred years ago, correct?

A.   Sure.  This is reprinting a story.  I think it was from Kansas City, Missouri.

Q.   Now, another slang term that came around that period of time was "cancer stick," right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you recall testimony in this case that --this was testimony from Mr. Barbose's daughter Dyanna that they used slang expressions, including "coffin nails" and "cancer sticks," around Mr. Barbose, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=680
2049

A.   Yes.

MR. CLARK:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  Rule of completeness, can we have that whole paragraph read? I didn't realize he was going to change.

MR. CARTER:  Sure.

THE COURT:  That's fine.

MR. CARTER:  Ryan, if you're able to pull up the exhibit itself, AHL-34.  I believe it's page 139.

What portion --

MR. CLARK:  The rest of that paragraph you were reading from earlier.

MR. CARTER:  Okay.  So start with "There"?

MR. CLARK:  Yes.

MR. CARTER:  "There was a great squabble over a smoke rule" --

MR. CLARK:  No, I'm sorry.  "There" in the first paragraph.

MR. CARTER:  Okay.  "There have always been quite a number of very decent people who could not understand why they should be forced to submit to the stench of 47 varieties of pipes,

el-cabbagoes" -- we'll call it -- "two-fors, coffin nails, et cetera, simply because a minority of smokers assumed the right to pollute the air in this

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=681

way and this time they got their revenge."

Did I read that correctly with the exclusion of

that word I wasn't sure how to pronounce?

A.   You got it right.

Those are cigars, by the way.  So those were the most common forms of tobacco being used back then.

Q.   And coffin nails is included in that list of --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- complaints, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And coffin nails is the one that refers to cigarettes, correct?

A.   I'm not sure what the author had in mind, but I've heard the term "coffin nails" used in reference to cigarettes, so sure.

MR. CARTER:  You can pull that down, Ryan. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   So back to where we were.

You remember the testimony from Dyanna Barbose that the family used slang expressions including "coffin nails" and "cancer sticks" specifically around Mr. Barbose?

A.   Yeah, I do recall that testimony.

Q.   For example, their daughter Dyanna testified they would say something to the effect of, "Oh, you're

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=682
2051

going outside to have a cancer stick." Do you recall that?

A.   I recall the use of the terms.  I don't recall all the details of it, but you can certainly -- yeah, recalls family statements about "cancer sticks" and "coffin nails."  Father would kind of ha-ha and walk out. "

Q.   And that was my next question.

The reaction that's reported was that Mr. Barbose would, to use your words, kind of "ha-ha" and walk out, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Ms. Barbose would say to her husband, "You're putting another nail in your casket," correct?

A.   I don't recall that, but, you know, I don't doubt it.  There were many hundreds of pages of deposition testimony.

Q.   People who smoked cigarettes have also been referred to as "nicotine fiends"?

A.   Sure, I've heard that term.

Q.   Nicotine has been referred to as "lady nicotine," correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   The reason they call it "lady nicotine" is the idea that nicotine is a seductress that could hook you,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=683
2052

correct?

A.   And keep you hooked, yeah.

Q.   Testimony in this case is Ms. Barbose used the expression "nicotine fit" in talking with Mr. Barbose, correct?

A.   That's right, because when he didn't have his cigarettes, he would have a nicotine fit.  In other words, he would get agitated, he would have strong cravings for a cigarette.  He just needed one.

Q.   And "nicotine fit" and those other slang terms conveyed the notion that smoking is hard to quit and that nicotine is the reason why?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   You mentioned Reader's Digest.  I'd like to follow up on Reader's Digest.

In the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, Reader's Digest was the number one publication in the country?

A.   It was, yeah.

Q.   The people at Reader's Digest were very antitobacco, correct?

A.   They didn't have the ads for cigarettes, unlike most magazines of the day.

Q. And not only did they not accept cigarette advertising, they also published articles that were antismoking, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=684
2053

A.   They did.  Many of them were just summaries of the medical evidence or lay summaries.

Q. In fact, the Surgeon General has recognized the Reader's Digest articles had an impact on what Americans knew about the dangers of smoking, correct?

A.   Yeah, it was one of the few sources where you could get reliable information.

Q.   And you talked about President Kennedy and the creation of the advisory committee and how that came about?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Before he was president, back when he was just a senator, he commented on Reader's Digest coverage of smoking and health, didn't he?

A.   That, I'm not familiar with.

Q.   I would like to show you AN-3438.  Will you read the letter that John F. Kennedy, then senator from Massachusetts, wrote to Reader's Digest in 1958, as excerpted on the screen?

A.   Sure.  "But in the Senate, I came across an old and trusted friend, the Reader's Digest, a magazine I began reading during my tours of Navy duty in World War II.  I found copies of it lying on other senators' desks and on committee tables throughout the Capitol building.  Excerpts appeared regularly in the

congressional record.  Digest stories figured heavily in committee hearings, such as those on postal administration, the cigarette-cancer relationship, the foreign aid program, and many other subjects of national importance."

Q.   Thank you.

You've also seen an article from 1964 where the American Cancer Society recognized Reader's Digest as having a profound influence on public awareness of smoking and health, correct?

A.   I don't recall that precisely, but depends on what you're going to show me.  And I'll tell you whether I remember seeing the article from the Cancer Society. MR. CARTER:  It's AIW-371.  Go ahead and pull

that up, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Do you recognize the title of the article, "I Quit Smoking" or "Cooper's Last Stand," correct?

A.   I do.

Q.   It was a famous article that was actually reprinted?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this is the reprint, correct?

A.   I'll take your word for it.

Q.   And up top, the lead-in that's called out on

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=686
2055

the screen, would you read what that says, please?

A.   Yeah.  "Since November 1924, the Reader's Digest has published 36 articles on smoking and health.  The American Cancer Society has termed them a profound influence in creating public awareness of the risks involved in smoking."

Q.   So as this indicates, 36 articles on smoking and health from 1924 to 1964, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the American Cancer Society termed that that contribution was a, quote, profound influence, correct?

A.   Yeah, because it was one of the few voices that were out there, 36 articles out of about 16,000 Reader's Digest articles.  So it was less than 1 percent of their articles.

Q.   But a 1 percent that was profound, according to the ACS?

A.   It was well under 1 percent, so I wouldn't want to represent it that way.  But, yeah, it was -- there was at least a voice out there trying to educate the public about the dangers of smoking.

Q.   Reader's Digest first published an article describing smoking as a cause of cancer in 1924, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=687
2056

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let's look at AIW-117, please.

You see here the story "Does Tobacco Injure the Human Body," correct?

A.   Right.  Talking about all forms of tobacco here, particularly cigar and pipe tobacco, because those were the predominant forms, and they cause oral cancer.

Q.   In this article in 1924, Reader's Digest has the language, quote, "Tobacco is injurious to the human body; its use sometimes induces cancer." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes, you did.

Q.   Let's look at another one, "Cancer by the Carton," from 1952, AS-915.  This is a well-known article; would you agree?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And the theme is that when you're buying a carton of cigarettes, you're buying a carton of cancer, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   It's a graphic title that's fairly easy to understand?

A.   It's an accurate title.

Q.   Let's look at another one.  "Nicotine Knockout or the Slow Count from 1941."  You're familiar with

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=688
2057

that, aren't you?

A.   Sure.  Gene Tunney, who was, at the time, the head of the Navy's physical fitness program, former heavyweight champion of the world.  And he published this, I think, in the first week of December 1941, I believe.

Q.   That's correct.  So as you indicated, heavyweight champion of the world, not a scientist working for the Navy, right?

A.   Right, he's in charge of physical fitness.

Q.   And he was a famous boxer who had fought Jack Dempsey twice, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the reference to the slow count, will you tell the jury what that story references?

A.   He was able to get up and finish off the fight, so he got the slow count.

Q.   And that slow count enabled him to win?

A.   That's right.

Q. And in this article, he's, in a sense, calling out the then current heavyweight champion of the world, Joe Louis, correct?

A. Yeah. He said he would challenge Joe Louis, who was the heavyweight champion at the time, if he'd smoke cigarettes.  Of course, Joe Louis, like many

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=689
2058

athletes of the day -- not sure whether he was a smoker, but he was featured in cigarette advertising marketing different brands like Camel.

Q.   So he said that if Joe Louis will start smoking and promise to inhale a couple of packages of cigarettes every day for six months, I'll engage to lick him in 15 rounds, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   In this article, Gene Tunney makes several statements about nicotine being a poison and about nicotine being addictive, correct?

A.   Nicotine is a poison.  It's a very potent insecticide.  When you get pure nicotine, it will kill you.

Yeah, he's pointing it out as a poison.

Q.   Let's look at what he says on page 21.

MR. CARTER:  That's not the right one.  Can we

go to � let's pull that one up. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   So, first, it says, "The cause of most of the trouble is, of course, nicotine," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If we could look at the next callout.  "This powerful poison is the source of all the pleasure derived from smoking.  It touches off a mechanism by

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=690
2059

which the adrenal glands release quick energy from the liver and muscles."

Do you see that?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And this was published in Reader's Digest in 1941 before Mr. Barbose ever tried a cigarette, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's look at another one.  1950.  How harmful -- continuing on in the article, page 23.  "I've already opposed the pernicious advertising that extolls the benefits of tobacco using."

That's also in the article, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   All right.  Let's look at a 1938 Reader's Digest, "So You're Going to Stop Smoking." AIW-137.  August of 1938, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. CARTER:  Let's just blow up that top half

of the page with the title, if we can. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   "Sooner or later, nearly every cigarette smoker discovers that he is not smoking by choice, but by habit, and that the habit is probably harmful.  So he tries to break free from it, finds that he doesn't know how.  Sometimes halfheartedly, sometimes earnestly, he

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=691
2060

wrestles with his addiction, but in vain." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Reader's Digest, 1938, when Mr. Barbose would have been 40 years old, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Referring to cigarette smoking as an addiction?

A.   Yes, wrestles with his addiction, but in vain.

Q.   I would like to look at one more.

"How Harmful Are Cigarettes," of January of 1950.

MR. CARTER:  It's AS-995.  We could go to

page 2, there is some language I would like to show. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Will you read that, Doctor?

A.   Sure.  "Nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco.  It is what makes tobacco tobacco and not just another weed."

Q.   You showed the jury a document from Claude Teague that talked about the sine qua non, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   What was the year of Dr. league's document?

A.   This was 1972.

Q.   And so here, 22 years earlier, Reader's Digest is saying that nicotine is the essential ingredient,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=692
2061

correct?

A.   Yeah, quite different than what Dr. Teague had said in 1972 where he was outlining the design specifications to keep people smoking, like the minimum amount of nicotine, the right pH.  You can go through the document that lays out the research agenda.

Q.   Sine qua non is Latin which you said relates essentially to the ingredient?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And "Nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco," in Reader's Digest, 22 years earlier, correct?

A.   Sure.  It's what keeps people smoking.

Q.   That concept of nicotine being the essential ingredient was also recorded in a famous article by Lennox Johnson in the Lancet?

A.   Yes.  I'm not sure if it was famous, but it's an article that was published in the Lancet in the 1940s.

Q.   And the Lancet is a preeminent medical journal, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   During the 1950s, there was expensive media coverage about the potential harm associated with using cigarettes, correct?

A.   In the '50s, yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=693
2062

Q.   Virtually everyone in our society had heard that smoking could cause disease by 1954?

A.   Had heard.  That means they had heard stories about smoking and disease.  Does not translate to belief.

Q.   And I wasn't asking the translation.  My question was, by 1954, virtually everyone had heard that?

A.   Yes, had heard.

Q.   Results of epidemiological studies.  Some of them you talked about on direct with Mr. Clark. Epidemiological studies from the United States, from the United Kingdom, those were released in 1950 and were widely publicized?

A.   True.

Q.   They were published in medical journals first?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And they were reported in newspapers and magazines, including Reader's Digest?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Wynder and Graham, we saw the pictorial in LIFE magazine that described not the epidemiological study, but the mouse painting that followed up in '53, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, Wynder and Graham's earlier

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=694
2063

epidemiological study was also reported on in the popular press, correct?

A.   Yes, it was.  He did many of them.

Q.   And Doll and Hill, who you discussed, their landmark epidemiological study was also covered in the popular press?

A.   True.  I mean, there was -- I think I had mentioned the five papers that were published 1949, 1950; the Bradford Hill and Sir Richard Doll's paper was published in the British Medical Journal; Dr. Wynder's paper; Dr. Mort Levine from Roswell Park published his paper.  Both of those were in JAMA.  There was Dr. Shreck's paper and cancer research.  There was one other that I'm missing.

But there was a number of these studies coming out all at one time and they were grabbing public attention.  Certainly, the scientific community was following it, and then it got picked up in the press.

Q.   You talked about Dr. Hammond and the American Cancer Society, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   They started collecting data for a prospective study in 1951, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   They ended up -- they got such interesting

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=695
2064

results that they published them early.  They published them after three years, correct?

A.   Yeah, he released the findings at the 1954 meeting of the American Medical Association.  This was a prospective study.

So unlike the other studies that looked at cancer patients versus controls and then asked about their history, that's retrospective, this was a study that took a hundred -- a little over a hundred thousand people and assessed what their smoking habits were, and then they followed them to see who got sick and who was dying of various diseases.

And, yeah, they had accumulated enough, you know, occurrences of lung cancer and heart disease to report those results, which they did in 1954, and subsequently published them.

Q.   And you've seen examples of media coverage, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Let's look at the TIME magazine cover AIW-224. And cover -- so you've got the cover on the left, and then within that magazine, there is the report on the ACS study, correct?

A.   That's correct.  At the American Medical Association meeting, as I mentioned.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=696
2065

Q.   And would you read that callout for the jury, please.

A.   Sure.  "A last-minute added attraction staged by a performer who previously had been most unwilling to get into the act stole the show at the AMA convention. The star, the American Cancer Society's statistician Edward Cuyler Hammond.  His show-stopping material/figures proving that heavy cigarette smokers die younger than nonsmokers, mainly from heart disease and cancer, notably cancer of the lung."

Q.   Between -- thank you, Doctor.

Between 1950 and 1959, TIME magazine actually carried an entire series of articles entitled "Smoking and Cancer," correct?

A.   They did.

Q.   And you've seen other executions of the stories that followed, right?

A.   Sure.  There is a massive amount of information.  The pathology studies were coming out from Dr. Auerbach.  The animal studies.  All the evidence was accumulating.  There was no doubt by the end of the 1950s.

Q.   We won't belabor it, but if we could see Demonstrative 7, show the jury.

This is an example of one of those continuing

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=697
2066

stories in TIME magazine, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it reports on death rates being 68 percent higher for cigarette smokers than nonsmokers, correct?

A.   Right.  I think this is the publication version of Dr. Hammond's work.  So they finally published their results and looked at the mortality rates of smokers and heavy smokers versus never smokers.

Q.   Moving on.  You show the pictorial in LIFE magazine from Wynder and Graham's mouse painting study. That was also covered in places like TIME, Newsweek, and Reader's Digest, correct?

A.   They did get coverage -- limited coverage in those publications, but, yeah, I mean, I'm not sure --Dr. Wynder is well known, so I'm not sure which -- which study you're referring to.  The one he did in '53 got covered, I think, in TIME and, certainly, in Life.

Q.   Now, the American Cancer Society, as part of their prospective study, they were conducting research around the country, gathering information from smokers, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And one of the places that they interviewed smokers was Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, correct?

A.   They probably did.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=698
2067

Q.   And that was where Mr. Barbose grew up, based on the materials you read, correct?

A.   Yeah, the Cancer Society's study � just so you are aware -- they did the study from 1951 to '55, then they reconstituted another cohort called "Cancer Prevention Study 1."  There was another one in 1982 that went for a number of years, and then another one that started up in 2000.

And the way they do these studies is, volunteers for the cancer society go out and recruit their neighbors, essentially, to be interviewed and then have their records followed up.  They're basically looking at death certificates and so on.

So all over the country, these are the largest studies we have, hundreds of thousands of people who have been tracked that are the basis for most of what we know about the epidemiology of smoking and lung cancer.

Q.   I'd like to show the jury just a couple examples of the coverage in Luzerne County.

MR. CARTER:  Can we have Demonstrative 18,

please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   And, here, we have a collection of headlines and stories from papers in that area.  We have November 23rd Sunday Independent, "County Included in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=699
2068

Cancer Society Smoking Study"; and, November 8th, "Local Study of Smoking Under Review."  And from the Eastern Express on the June 21st, the subsequent year, 1954, "Cigarette Smokers Die Sooner Than Others, 50 to 70, ACS Says."

Do you see those?

A.   I do.  These are just the headlines.

Typically, you get a response from the industry, so you have to look at the whole article. I've got collections of many of these articles.  I'm not sure if you could provide the full article.  That would be helpful to give context.

Q.   Sure, I'll give you a copy.  I just wanted to show them.  If there is something counsel wants to ask you about on redirect, I'm sure they will, or if you find something.

A.   That's fine.

Q.   There you go.

A.   Appreciate it.

Q.   You're welcome.

You showed an excerpt from a news program "See It Now," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you said, I think, or maybe counsel said it was kind of like the "60 Minutes" of its day?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=700
2069

A.        That's   right.

Q.   Edward R. Murrow was the host?

A.   Correct.

Q.   He was a respected journalist?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   They ran, actually, two weeks of programs on "See It Now" covering this topic, correct?

A.   Yeah, in the spring of 1955.

Q.   You showed a few clips that included statements from tobacco industry representatives answering questions, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You indicated, I think, that members of the public health also appeared on the program, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   I would like to show the jury portions of those clips.

MR. CARTER:  If we could get AIW-235, please,

from the same "See It Now" program.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"Good evening.  This is 'See It Now,' produced

by the partnership of Friendly and Murrow.  Tonight

the first of two reports on cigarettes and lung

cancer.

2070

In 1952, Doctors Hammond and Horn of the American Cancer Society began an extended study of the smoking habits of American men.  Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the results of the first two years.

It is now established, in my opinion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that cigarette smoking greatly increases the probability of developing lung cancer

In my opinion, people should be warned of the dangers and they are being warned.  What they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not is their own business.

Next, Dr. Ernst Wynder and research assistant Adele Croninger.

In this bottle contains the amount of tar to which the average heavy cigarette smoker is exposed to over a given year's period of time.

We believe that the present evidence, that it strongly indicates that tobacco smoking and particularly cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   That was also part of the program, correct? A.   Yes, sir.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=702
2071

Q.   In the 1950s, the Surgeon General actually spoke about whether Americans were aware of the risks of smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  I would like to get

Demonstrative 8, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   You're familiar with Surgeon General Burney, correct?

A.   I am.  He actually made a statement in 1957 that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer based on the evidence.  That was the first official statement from the U.S. Surgeon General of the United States.  So that actually predates the '64 report.

Q.   And that same year, he also issued the statement that we have on the screen, correct?

A.   He didn't issue the statement.  You're referring to the testimony he was asked by a congressman at a hearing, you know, what have you been doing to try to educate the public about the health risks of smoking.

And he comments that, "Our position is we have informed the public through excellent coverage of the press, radio, and TV."

So that's the response there.  It wasn't issuing a statement, per se.  He was answering a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=703
2072

question from his boss, the congressman.

Q.   And at that time, he was under oath?

A.   Sure.  Well, I'm not sure he was under oath or not.  Chances are he was.  It was a congressional hearing.  The Blackman hearings, I think you're referring to.

Q.   You're also familiar with the Dr. Heller, who was the director of a division of the National Cancer Institute, correct?

A.   I am.

Q.   And Dr. Heller made similar comments in 1957, correct?

A.   He was at the same hearings and asked the same questions, essentially.  And the National Cancer Institute at that time also agreed that the evidence was sufficient to say that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

MR. CARTER:  And if we could get

Demonstrative 9, please, and see what Dr. Heller

said in response to the question. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Quote, "Newspapers, radio, and TV and other media have done an excellent job in covering this problem and a very objective job.  This is an exceedingly valuable way of informing the public."

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=704
2073

That's what Dr. Heller said at that hearing, correct?

A.   He did.

Q.   Something else important happened in the 1950s. That's the decade that Mr. Barbose met and married Ms. Barbose, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Mrs. Barbose testified that she never purchased cigarettes for Mr. Barbose because she thought they were damaging to his health, correct?

A.   She did say that.

Q.   She also testified that her husband knew that was why she refused to buy him cigarettes, correct?

A.   It's not entirely correct on the question of what he knew.  I think she points out that early on, as I recall, nobody knew that smoking was harmful, but later on he certainly knew that would be true in the 1980s.

Q.   And you reviewed, in connection with your work on this case, her testimony at page 153 and on page 154, correct?

A.   I'd have to go check my notes.  I mean, if you wanted me to show what she said, that's fine.  I mean --

Q.   Well, when you reviewed the materials, you didn't skip through, you read the depositions of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=705
2074

fact witnesses or Ms. Barbose's deposition cover to cover, correct?

A.   I did.  I read them cover to cover.  I do highlights and then I go back over the highlights.  I make my notes from my highlights.  And that's how I put my notes together.  They're not a verbatim transcript of the deposition because, obviously, that exists.

Q.   Do you recall her testimony that when she was asked if she ever bought cigarettes for her husband, she said no.  And then she was asked if that was because he refused to buy them, she said yes.  And then she was asked if she would refuse to buy his cigarettes because she thought they were damaging, she said exactly.

And then she was asked whether he knew she refused to buy them because you thought he was hurting his health by smoking them, and provided the answer "Yes."

A. Yeah, I recall that. And I also recall, as I just testified, that on page 225, she said smoking was not a concern when dating back in the 1950s.

Q.   Mrs. Barbose also testified that she remembered the hit country song "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette" by Tex Williams, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   That was a chart topper in 1947, initially?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=706
2075

A.   Sure.

Q.   And that's something she testified, that Mr. Barbose had also heard the song, correct? A.   I believe she did.

Q.   And you're familiar with it, of course? A.   Of course.

MR. CARTER:  I'd like to play that for the jury.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"Now I'm a feller with a heart of gold, with the ways of a gentleman, I've been told.  The kind of a feller that wouldn't even harm a flea.

But if me and a certain character met, the guy that invented the cigarette, I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree.

Now, it ain't cause that I don't smoke myself and I don't reckon they hinder your health.  I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet.  But nicotine slaves are all the same, at a petting party or a poker game, everything gotta stop while they have that cigarette.

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette.  Puff, puff, puff.  And if you smoke yourself to death, tell St. Peter at the golden gate that you hate to

make him wait, but you just gotta have another

cigarette."

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   That's the song you're familiar with, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Moving forward in time, Mr. Barbose's father, Francis, we talked earlier about how he was a smoker. He quit smoking in the late 1950s or early 1960s, according to the testimony you reviewed, correct?

A.   I believe that's true.  From Sam.

Q.   Exactly.  According to Sam, their father, Francis, quit smoking because he thought it was affecting his health, correct?

A.   He may have said that.  I don't recall specifically why the father had quit, but I do recall the testimony that he did quit.  I think he quit because he had -- he worked in the coal mines.  He had, you know, lung disease, black lung disease from working in the coal mines.  I imagine smoking on top of that is not a good thing.

Q.   And Sam's testimony was that Mr. Barnes knew their father had quit smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

"The CBS News Extra on smoking and health; the

findings of the Surgeon General's committee.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=710
2079

Almost from the moment that cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked, but the attacks took a new turn ten years ago and culminated in today's report by the Surgeon General's committee.  This, in summary, is what the committee says:

Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women smokers points the same way.  Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of cancer of the larynx and probably the most important cause of chronic bronchitis.  Cigarette smoking may be related to other lung diseases.  Male smokers have a much higher death rate from heart disease, although it's not proven that smoking is the cause.

On the question of filters, the committee says there is no evidence they do any good, but it didn't exclude the possibility that an effective filter might be developed.

In short, the committee says, if you smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.

The Surgeon General's committee presented its report at a news conference in Washington:

Out of its long and exhaustive deliberations,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=711
2080

the committee has reached the overall judgment that cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance to the United States to warrant remedial action.  This overall judgment was supported by many converging lines of evidence, as well as by data indicating that cigarette smoking is related to higher death rates in a number of disease categories.

More specifically, the committee states on page 61 of the report, and I quote, 'In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate.'

In this kind of a country, it comes down to you, whether you like it or not.  No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him either.  The decision is his, the decision and the health that may depend on it.

This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night."

Q.   That was also on that same broadcast?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=712
2081

A.   Yeah.  I think you cut excerpts that we showed, and I think the only new excerpt was just showing the actual committee report, and then you left out some of the other material that we showed.

Q.   In 1966, January 1st, the first health warnings started to appear on packs of cigarettes, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Congress told the companies exactly what the warnings were required to say, correct?

A. The law was passed. Congress is the body that passes the laws. So, yes, they specify the � the text and where it goes on the packs and so on.

Q.   They specified how big the print should be?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Starting in 1966, those labels went on every pack of cigarette sold, correct?

A.   In the United States, that's true.

Q.   Including Mr. Barbose's cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

MR. CARTER:  Like to see Demonstrative 10,

please, which is the language from that 1966 label. BY MR. CARTER:

Q. "Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health." That's what -- what went on the pack starting in 1966, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=713
2082

A. Yeah, that was the proposed language that came from the cigarette companies that actually proposed the law.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, move to strike. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Now, Ms. Barbose testified that she was sure that her husband read the warning, correct?

A.   She did.

Q.   She also testified that she was sure by January of 1966 that her husband understood that smoking might be hazardous to his health?

A.   By January of 1966?

Q.   Yes.

A.   I'm not sure I recall that.

Q.   Okay.  Ms. Barbose said that she was sure he heard about the Surgeon General's warning at some point and attempted to talk to Mr. Barbose about it, but she could not recall when they -- when she attempted that conversation, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   She said it didn't matter because Mr. Barbose did not want to talk about that subject with her, correct?

A.   I don't know what timeframe you're referring

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=714
2083

to.

Q.   Is there any timeframe during the course of Mr. Barbose's life for which Ms. Barbose said that her husband wanted to talk about smoking and health with her?

A.   Certainly, she was observing him making quit attempts from the mid 1980s to the 1990s, just before he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Q.   You're familiar with Ms. Barbose's testimony that she, to use her own description, nagged her husband repeatedly about his smoking, correct?

A.   Yeah, I guess that's talking about it.

Q.   And in response, Mr. Barbose's reaction was to get upset with her for giving him grief, correct?

A.   Well, at times.  And at other times, his effort was to try to stop smoking, because he was trying to stop.

Q.   During those conversations, Mr. Barbose never told Ms. Barbose that she did not know what she was talking about or that her admonition to quit smoking was incorrect?

A.   No, I don't think he -- the discussions they had about smoking is he had gone to Marlboro Lights because the filter was taking things out of his cigarettes and not to worry.

Q.   We talked earlier about that record period of cessation from 1964 to 1979.  And we talked about the four-year period, that first window, '66 to '70, where a record 13 million smokers quit, correct?

A.   13 million people quit, yeah, as a result of the Fairness Doctrine period, because of the warnings.

Q.   And in 1970, after that period, the warning on the package was changed, correct?

A.   That's right, because it was deemed to be ineffective by the Federal Trade Commission.

I think we did show the '67 FTC report that talked about the ineffectiveness of the original warning.

Q.   I was going to get there later, but let's go there now.

A.   Sure.

Q.   And we'll come back to where I was.

You showed the 1967 FTC report, correct?

A.   I did.

MR. CARTER:  Plaintiff's 3870, if we can pull

that up, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   And as you just testified, you believe that one of the conclusions of the report was that the '66 warning was not effective, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=716
2085

A.   That's what they say.

Q. And this document also explains the methodology and the material that they relied upon for reaching that conclusion, correct?

A.   Yeah.  We talked about it by measure of cigarette sales.  Cigarette sales went up and peaked after the warnings had been put on the cigarettes in 1966.  So that was one of the methods that they used. They talked about some other methods, but that was the primary method that they relied on.

Q.   And let's look at the discussion in the document where they talk about the surveys that they relied upon.

MR. CARTER:  So, actually, can we get the top

paragraph of the page, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   So you see right off the top, Doctor, in preparing this report, the Commission has used as source material the results of three surveys.  Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   They go on to list the three surveys.  The --two of them were the surveys from 1964 and 1966, the attitudes and beliefs of adults survey, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And then the third one is what they described

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=717
2086

as the commission survey, correct?

A.   Right.  They went and asked medical experts and public health officials about whether they thought the current warning that had been put on was adequate or not.

MR. CARTER:  And let's pull up the next

paragraph where they discuss that very process. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Starts off talking, the commission survey was conducted in '67, correct, April of '67?

A.   Yeah, the survey, yeah.

Q.   And, actually, before we get there, so the '64 survey that they studied -- or excuse me -- the '64 survey that they included, that's two years before the warnings went on the pack, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So that survey doesn't tell you anything about the warnings specifically, because that question couldn't have been posed before the warnings were on the pack?

A.   Tells you a lot.  You know, tells you --because it's a study of attitudes and beliefs of smokers conducted before the warnings appear.

Q.   The '67 �

A.   Then they do the follow-up survey in '66 after

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=718
2087

the warnings have appeared and they compare the results. So that's why they used those two surveys, a pre/post test.

Q.   The '66 edition of the survey came out within two months after the warnings had actually appeared on the packs, correct? A.   True.

Q.   And then this one, which was done in April of '67, they talk about the process and how it was sent out.  It reads � you can start � actually, let's read the paragraph.

"The commission survey was conducted in April of 1967 and consisted of a questionnaire sent to approximately 450 persons and organizations actively engaged or interested in the subject of smoking and health.

"Close to 60 percent responded.  The selection of addresses was somewhat arbitrary and did not include the entire scientific community.  However, an effort was made to include persons who had indicated opposition to governmental regulations in the area of cigarette smoking, although such persons were clearly in the minority."

Have I read that correctly so far? A.   You have.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=719
2088

Q.   Then the highlighted portion, "It should be noted that the commission survey asked for the opinions of the respondents rather than for factual information or for the results of scientific inquiry; e.g. one of the questions was, quote, "Do you feel that the current cautionary labeling statement is sufficient to warn people of the hazards of smoking?"  End quote.

"Many of those responding emphasized that they had no hard facts to support their answers. Nonetheless, the commission considers the opinions of scientists active in the field of cigarette smoking and health to be pertinent to its report and is presenting them here as an indication of the views of the part of the scientific community that was surveyed." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   All right.  Let's move back to where we were, 1970, warning label changes.

MR. CARTER:  Demonstrative 11, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q. And the new warning label language reads, "Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."

That was the warning that went on packs of cigarettes starting in 1970, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=720
2089

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we talked about this earlier.  Starting in '72, this warning went on the ads?

A.   Print ads, not promotional advertising.

Q.   And �

A.   So it didn't go on tee shirts and caps and some of the other things.

Q.   And broadcast ads were gone by the time the print warning was put on?

A.   Well, you know, paid broadcast advertising is -- we saw, I think, last week, the companies managed to get their advertising on television in other ways with sports promotions and such.

Q.   With respect to Mr. Barbose, Ms. Barbose testified that she was sure the subject of the 1970s warning came up in conversations that Mr. Barbose had with co-workers and those around him.  Do you recall that testimony?

A.   I don't offhand.  She may have mentioned it.

Q.   Mrs. Barbose testified that she never heard Mr. Barbose challenge any of the warnings on cigarette packages or say that he did not believe them.  That is her testimony, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mrs. Barbose also told stories about how she

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=721
2090

clipped articles on the health risks of smoking over the years and gave them to Mr. Barbose starting in the late 1970s?

A.   Correct.

Q.   She said that that clipping practice continued into the '80s, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And sometimes their daughters would give her articles and she, in turn, would give them to her husband, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   When she could give those articles to Mr. Barbose in the '70s, her testimony was she would sometimes refuse to even read them, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   She said that when she would give those articles, he would get upset and, to use her words, would give -- well, strike that.

She testified that she was upset with the fact that she was giving him grief about his smoking, correct?

A.   I think you're paraphrasing there.  Be best just to go to the testimony to see exactly what she said.

Q.   And if we look at her testimony -- are you

Do you see that testimony? A.   I do.  But above that, it also says he would read it.  Not every word necessarily.

Q.   But the testimony about him getting upset because she was, quote, giving him � giving him grief is contained in her deposition, correct? A.   What line again? Q.   Page 82, line 12 through 15. A.   What he says, you know, just to be clear:

"Okay.  But he didn't simply toss them aside and refuse to read them?

"Answer:  Oh, once in a while.  I would say in the late '70s I doubt that he read them, but later on in years, I think he read them.

"Question:  Okay.  And why do you think in the late '70s he may have not read the articles?

"Answer:  He would just get upset with me for giving him grief."

So that's what it says. Q.   And my question was, the phrase "giving him grief" is something that she used and it comes in the deposition?

A.   Yeah, it is there, but it says � yeah, it does say that.

"Answer:  No."

Is that the section you wanted me to read? Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   And so now that we've been through it, that's her testimony, and she talked about how he would get upset with her for giving him grief?

A.   Yeah, and how she was trying to inform him

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=726
2095

about the health risks of smoking.

Q.   Despite the reaction, she continued clipping articles about smoking and health and continued giving them to her husband through the '80s and 1990s, correct?

A.   Yeah, when he would read them.

Q.   And according to Mrs. Barbose, Mr. Barbose would continue to getting -- or excuse me -- continue to get upset with her when she said something about his smoking?

A.   Sometimes, and sometimes he tried to quit.

Q.   For example, if she thought he was smoking more than usual, according to her testimony, she would say something like, "You know you're smoking a lot tonight." And in response, she describes he would shoot her a look and she knew to be quiet.

You recall that testimony, correct?

A.   Sure.  As most spouses come to recognize.

Q.   Also in the 1970s when their daughter Deborah was growing up, Mr. Barbose told his daughter to never try to smoke because she would not be able to stop, correct?

A.   Yes, he did say that.

Q.   In the 1980s, Mrs. Barbose purchased life --life insurance for Mr. Barbose, correct?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=727
2096

Q.   And Mr. Barbose understood that the premium for his policy was higher because he was a smoker and had greater risks, correct?

A.   That's true, but I don't know whether he understood.  He understood he was paying more money because you pay more money as a smoker.  They call it a nonsmoker discount, but it's really a smoker penalty.

Q.   And Ms. Barbose's testimony was that she believed her husband understood that it wasn't just because he was a smoker, but it was because smoking had risks?

A.   I don't know that.  I'd have to go refresh my memory of her testimony.

Q.   I think the jury will have that opportunity --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- later in the case.

A.   Good.

Q.   Let's -- we'll talk about the rotating warnings that went on the packages starting in 1985.

MR. CARTER:  If we could get Demonstrative 12,

please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   These are the four rotating warnings, correct?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   One on the top left, "Surgeon General's

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=728
2097

Warning:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Bottom left, "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   For any print ads that ran after the warnings had changed to this, one of these four would have appeared on the print ads as well, correct?

A.   That's right.  They rotated.

Q.   According to Ms. Barbose, her husband frequently had a cough, correct?

A.   Later in life, that's true.

Q.   And when he would cough, sometimes she would say, "Listen to yourself," and invite him to lay off the smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He would respond by ignoring her and continuing smoking, correct?

A.   Not always.  He was making quit attempts when -- in the late '80s and '90s when he's beginning to notice the cough.

Q.   And you're familiar with her testimony where she was asked if he ignored her and provided the answer, yes, that he continued smoking?

A.   She may have said that.  I don't know.

Q.   You mentioned the Fairness Doctrine.

A.   Uh-huh.  (Indicates affirmatively.)

Q.   During the '60s, '70s, and '80s, there were various advertisements urging people to quit smoking on the television, correct, public service announcements?

A.   I mentioned the Fairness Doctrine, and that is not what you're referring to.  You're referring to something different, which are public service ads that appear.

So public service ads are filling in slots that are not paid for, usually at like 2:00 in the morning. But that -- that there are public service ads that appeared in the '70s, '80s, '90s.

And the Fairness Doctrine period is in the period between, essentially, 1968 to 1970, when the broadcast media, the three television stations were required to run ads in proportion to the cigarette ads that appeared under a law, under the Fairness Doctrine. And that's when many Americans first learned about the dangers of smoking.

Q.   And my point, which we were going to get to --we'll get to it now.  The Fairness Doctrine was that limited time period where antitobacco messages, as part of the doctrine, were required to be given air time?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=730

A. Yeah. As long as cigarette ads were broadcast, in other words, television and radio, you'd have to have an antismoking ad.

It didn't quite work out there in saying one-to-one ratio as required by the law, but it was more like four cigarette ads to every one antismoking ad, but it had a big effect.  And so here, the companies are spending a lot of money on their advertising and cigarette sales are actually beginning to drop during this period.  So it's not surprising that they were happy to go off the TV and radio, as did the antismoking ads at that time.

Q.   Public service announcements against smoking ran before the Fairness Doctrine was instituted, correct?

A.   I'm not aware of pre-Fairness Doctrine antismoking ads.  I mean, there were certainly posters and some materials put out.  Not television ads, that I'm aware of.

Q.   After the Fairness Doctrine ended, public service announcements on TV continued?

A.   After the Fairness Doctrine ended, there were efforts to put public service ads to educate the public about smoking on television.  Particularly around the Great American Smokeout and so on, there were ads that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=731
2100

the Cancer Society ran.  That started really late 1970s.

Q.   You -- you mentioned the Great American Smokeout.  You're familiar with an Ed Asner PSA that ran in 1977 promoting the Great American Smokeout, correct? A.   Yes.

Mr. CARTER:  I'd like to play that for the jury.  It's AN-759, please.

(The video clip was published to the jury in open court as follows:)

"I'm Ed Asner.  The American Cancer Society has asked me to quit smoking.  I'm asking you to join me .

Now, don't panic.  It's just for a day, November 16th.  That's the day they like every smoker in America to take a breather from cigarettes.  Won't be easy, but it's worth a try.

They figure if people can quit for a day, they just might quit for a lifetime.  That's what it's all about, a lifetime, yours and mine." (The video clip concluded.) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Another famous actor from this era was Yul Brynner, correct?

A.   Correct.  He did a postmortem ad for the American Cancer Society in the 1980s when he was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=732
2101

diagnosed with lung cancer, and they aired it after he

had passed away.

Q.   And he passed away in October of 1985, correct? A.   That's right.

MR. CARTER:  Let's show that ad to the jury. It's AN-3130.

(The video clip was published to the jury in

open court as follows:)

"Ladies and gentlemen, the late Yul Brynner. I really wanted to make a commercial when I discovered I was that sick and my time was so limited.  I wanted to make a commercial that says simply, 'Now, that I'm gone, I tell you, don't smoke.  Whatever you do, just don't smoke.  If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer.  I'm convinced of that.'" (The video clip concluded.)

BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The Yul Brynner ad and the Ed Asner ad, those

were both after the Fairness Doctrine ceased to be,

correct?

A.   That's true.  They weren't paid ads.  They were

public service ads.  So they -- they fit into the

television stations when they had the time or willing to

air them.  They didn't necessarily get prime time.

Q.   Switching gears again, we're done with the chronology.  Want to talk about the 1953 Plaza Hotel meeting and the Frank Statement discussed with the jury

The Plaza Hotel meeting ultimately led to the formation of the TIRC and the publishing of the Frank Statement, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You talked about that formation a fair bit. The New York Times actually reported on the meeting at the Plaza Hotel within a week of it meeting, correct?

A.   I believe in January there was an article in the New York Times talking about the fact that the companies had gotten together.

MR. CARTER:  Let's look at the New York Times

coverage, APS-559, please.

Hold on.  Before we put it up -- okay.  Ryan,

pull that up, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   New York Times, January 2nd, 1954.  Headline, "Industry Confers to Aid Cigarettes."

You're familiar with this coverage, correct? Is what you were referencing just a moment ago?

A.   Yeah.

MR. CARTER:  Like to look at another document,

Plaintiff's Exhibit 2135.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=734
2103

MR. CLARK:  Can you go back to that for a second?

MR. CARTER:  Sure.

MR. CLARK:  Read that first paragraph. MR. CARTER:  First paragraph, "A plan for concerted action to clear cigarettes of guilt for causing lung cancer is being mapped by the major cigarette manufacturers at highly-secret meetings now going on at a midtown hotel daily." BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   New York Times reported that there were highly-secret meetings, correct? A.   They were.

Q.   Not -- not secret enough to avoid the fact that they were reported in the New York Times, but that's what -- that's what they wrote, correct?

A.   That's what they wrote, because within two days you're going to see the Frank Statement announcing the formation and signed by the defendants who showed up at the -- at the Plaza Hotel meeting, so about a month earlier.

MR. CARTER:  So let's look at Plaintiff's Exhibit -- Plaintiff's Exhibit 2135 that recounts the December 15th meeting at the Plaza Hotel. Pull the top up.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

2104

BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Dated December 15, 1953.

You're familiar with this document, Doctor?

A.   I am.

MR. CARTER:  Could we look at Section 2,

please.

Pull up the highlighted section.  Sorry.  I

said "Section 2."  I meant page 2, Section 3. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Would you read that to the jury.

A.   Sure.

"The industry is strongly convinced that there is no sound scientific basis for the charges that have been made.  They believe that the more sensible --sensational accusations in the recent papers were premature and, in some cases, represent a publicity issued in the hopes of attracting funds and support for further research.  They point out that the National Cancer Institute of the United Public -- U.S. Public Health Administration, which is a government agency and supported by congressional appropriations, has officially refuted the tie-up between cigarettes, smoking, and cancer."

Q.   So at the top of this section in a memo that was private at the time --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=736
2105

A.   Yeah.

Q.   -- they wrote that the industry is strongly convinced that there is no sound scientific basis for the charges that have been made, correct?

A.   Yeah.  Of course, that -- they're not referencing Claude league's, you know, internal Reynolds' document that had been written in February of this year.  And this is December.  So certainly, Dr. Teague had reported to senior management at R.J. Reynolds there was sound scientific evidence implicating cigarette smoking as a cause of lung cancer in heavy-smoking men.

Q.   The folks from Hill & Knowlton, what they wrote is what's on the page for the jury to see, correct?

A.   Sure.  These are the notes of John Hill.

Q.   You talked about the Frank Statement.  It was published January 4th, 1954, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   No testimony in this case that Mr. Barbose read the Frank Statement, is there?

A.   No.

Q.   You're aware that the Surgeon General's reported that when the Frank Statement was published, it actually caused an increase in the belief that smoking was dangerous, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=737
2106

A.   Well, there was a poll done by Gallup that had indicated people had heard or read about smoking and health issues, and I suspect the Frank Statement going out in major newspapers probably contributed to that.

Q.   And I'll reask my question.  I'm not sure I got an answer.

The Surgeon General found when the Frank Statement was published, it actually caused an increase in the belief that smoking was dangerous?

A.   They're referring to the Gallup Poll, 1954.

Q.   And they said that it caused an increase in belief that smoking was dangerous, correct?

A.   Well, they're -- they're saying that it --basically, people had read or heard about smoking and health, where prior to that time it really wasn't even on the radar screen for most people.

Q.   So is the answer to my discrete question yes?

A.   Sure.  You can find reference in the history, and they're just referencing the polling information.

Q.   You showed the jury a letter to an Assistant Attorney General Judge Stanley Barnes, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this was a document that discussed the formation of TIRC and how it was disclosed to the Department of Justice, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=738
2107

A.   That's right.

Q.   Page 6 of that described where they were retaining Hill & Knowlton as the PR firm for the TIRC, correct?

A.   That's what I had told the jury when we talked about that document.

Q.   And they also told the Surgeon -- or excuse me -- the Attorney General's office that the committee was proceeding under the advice of legal counsel?

A.   That's right.  And they outlined the limits of power, what the TIRC was about, that they were going to fund objective research into the allegations of smoking and disease, particularly as they relate to lung cancer, and provide factual information to the American public.

Q.   You talked about materials that the Surgeon General's advisory committee relied on in issuing a landmark report?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You're familiar with a book titled "Tobacco: Experimental and Clinical Studies" by three doctors, Dr. Larson, Haag, and Silvette, correct?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   And that is a book that's colloquially referred to as "The Green Monster," correct?

A.   Yes, it is.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=739
2108

Q.   Because the cover was green and it was a very thick, hardbound volume, correct?

A.   True.

Q. And in that book, it reports on more than 6,000 articles of experimental and clinical smoking and health studies, correct?

A.   That's right.  Published in 1961.

Q.   It was a collection of what was available in the then public literature, correct?

A.   It's a collection of, you know, information, yes, on issues related to cancer, various diseases, and smoking.

Q.   And the book was funded in part by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q. It was cited by the Surgeon General's committee as a key research tool?

A.   Yes.  In fact, I think they -- in the '64 Surgeon General's report, they acknowledged receipt of that and use of that particular document for articles that have been published prior to 1959.  And then for articles after from '59 up to 1964, they relied on the National Library of Medicine as the -- you know, to get the new sources of data.  So they did reference the articles out of there.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=740
2109

Q.   And let's look at that reference you just described.

MR. CARTER:  Could we have AS-15, page 14 of

the U.S. Surgeon General's Report. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   And, Doctor, if you would please read that to the jury.

A.   Sure.

"As the primary duty of the committee was to assess information about smoking and health, a major general requirement was that of making the information available.  The requirement was met in three ways.  The first and most important was the bibliographic service provided by the National Library of Medicine.

"As the annotated monograph by Larson, Haag & Silvette, and compiled from more than 6,000 articles published in some 1,200 journals up to and largely into 1959, was available as a basic reference source.  The National Library of Medicine was requested to compile a bibliography by author and subject covering the world's literature from 1958 to the present."

Q.   The Surgeon General specifically thanked those doctors for their contribution of "The Green Monster," correct?

A.   Yes.  And this is just one source.  They also

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=741
2110

talked about the sources of information requested from each of the companies.

Q.   Drs. Larson, Haag, and Silvette continued to publish subsequent volumes in 1968, '71, and '75, correct?

A.   Yes.  Yellow, green -- or yellow, blue, and orange, I believe, were the colors.

Q.   A gold custardy color?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Those were all publicly available and all available to the Surgeon General?

A.   Well, I wouldn't say they're publicly available.  Certainly wasn't something that smokers were getting, but you could go to the library and find it in medical libraries.  So in that regard, I would say yes.

Q.   They were not internal to the companies?

A.   No, they were just summaries of literature. There are no conclusions really in those documents.

And that's really the key.  Nice to collect up a bunch of articles, but usually do that to draw some inference or conclusion from the evidence.

Q.   You agree that a lot of the research that was funded by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and subsequently CTR, but a lot of that research was excellent?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=742
2111

A.   It was excellent scientific research.  As I pointed out to the jury, when you look at the articles generated from the studies they funded, 6,000 of those, only about 600 had to do with smoking and health.

So 90 percent not on smoking and health, about 10 percent on smoking and health.  So -- but they were -- they were great articles, and they funded some really wonderful scientists, including several who went on to win Nobel Prizes.  Not for the work they did for CTR, but they -- they funded, you know, academic institutions all over the world and some eminent people.

Q.   Included in the Nobel Prize winners, there were actually ten who went on win Nobel Prizes, right?

A.   That's correct, but not for the work that they did under CTR.

Q.   Your former institution, Roswell Park, received funding from CTR from the 1950s through 1992, correct?

A.   Well, there was some suspension of activity.  I mean, they funded Dr. Bock, Fred Bock, for a while and then withdrew his funding because he was doing some research that, I guess, they didn't like.  That's what I've read from the internal business records.

But, yeah, then they funded some scientists who were doing non-, you know, smoking-related research at Roswell Park later on.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=743
2112

Q.   Roswell Park received funding from CTR while you were working there?

A.   They did, until the institute, as we finally generated some internal records, actually did leak out on CTR in the early '90s.  And when that information became available, our institution initiated a policy not to take money from CTR because they were a fraud.

Q.   You talked to the jury about the Scientific Advisory Board?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The members of the Scientific Advisory Board of CTR were reputable scientists, correct?

A.   Yes, they were.

Q.   They were ex -- they were experts in a variety of scientific disciplines?

A.   Yeah.  They didn't select epidemiologists necessarily for that group.  Since a lot of the information on smoking and health was epidemiology, that was odd, but they did have some various themed scientists from leading academic medical centers all over the country who served on the Scientific Advisory Board.

Q.   And the members of the advisory board did not quit their day jobs.  They continued their affiliations with their respective universities and medical

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=744
2113

organizations while they were on the board, correct?

A.   Yes.  It turned out to be quite lucrative for the SAB, because their institutions received millions of dollars of funding, which is a little unusual.  Because normally when you go on those advisory boards, your money doesn't come to your institution, so you're doing it independently.  But that was not the case for the SAB.  And that was the source of some concern about its legitimacy.

Q. CTR funded millions of dollars in grants to researchers and research institutions throughout the United States, including here in Florida?

A.   Yes, all the major universities here; University of South Florida, Miami, Florida, Florida State, all got money from CTR.

Q.   Thousands of articles, as you indicated, over 6,000 articles, were published as a result of CTR research?

A.   True.  And about 600 of those, 10 percent were on smoking --

Q.   And �

A.   -- smoking and health, what they were funded to do.

Q.   600 to 700 of those were cited in Surgeon General's reports?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=745
2114

A.   Exactly.

Q.   CTR -- well, actually, then, at the time, it was TIRC also funded research on nicotine being addictive, correct?

A.   They did have some funding in that regards early on and actually into the late '70s, and then that research was cut off because the lawyers said it was damaging to the companies.

MR. CARTER:  I'd like to look at one of the

articles that was published.  If we could get

AIW-2649, article published in the American Journal

of Psychiatry.  If we could go to the start of the

article. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Doctor, you're familiar with this article, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   It's titled "Addictive Aspects of Heavy Cigarette Smoking" by Peter Knapp and some additional authors, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q. And so this was published in American Journal of Psychiatry in the edition from 1962 to 1963, and it was funded in part by the TIRC, correct?

A.   True.  And subsequently cited in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=746
2115

Surgeon General's reports.

Q.   And also funded in part by the American Cancer Society?

A.   That's right.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I don't know if we were going to take another short break.  If we are, this is a good point.  If not, I'm happy to plug on.

THE COURT:  All right.  How is the jury doing over there?  Want to take a break?

THE JURORS WHO RESPONDED:  Yes, please.

THE COURT:  All right.  We're going to take a 15-minute break then.

Remind you of the previous instructions concerning that.  Don't discuss this amongst yourselves or do any investigation in this case. We'll do 15 minutes by the courthouse clock.

THE BAILIFF:  All rise.  Court stands in recess for 15 minutes by the courthouse clock.

(The jury excused from the courtroom at 3:39 p.m.)

THE BAILIFF:  Jury's out of the hearing of the Court, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you.

Yes, Counsel, how we doing timing-wise?

MR. CARTER:  I think I'm on track with my

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=747
2116

earlier prediction.  If I can better it, I will.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So we're going to take 15-minute break.  You said 4:00?

MR. CARTER:  Well, that was � I meant two hours of record time, not exclusive of breaks. So �

THE COURT:  All right.  And then � so we'll go right into Ms. Yates' cross-examination and depending on how long that will take, then we'll go into redirect, correct?

MR. BIGGER:  Sounds good, Judge.

THE COURT:  So, hopefully, Dr. Cummings has an early flight out.

MR. BIGGER:  We'll be as � as focused and as precise on our redirect as we can, given that we have cross-examination.

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll stand down for 15 minutes then.  Court will be in recess.

PROCEEDINGS (Court called to order at 3:52 p.m.) THE COURT:  Okay.  Counsel, we ready to proceed?

MR. CARTER:  I am, Your Honor.  Thank you. THE COURT:  You may bring the jury back in. THE BAILIFF:  Jury is entering the courtroom, Your Honor.

(The jury entered the courtroom at 3:54 p.m.) THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated. Counsel, you may proceed.

KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., plaintiff's witness herein, being previously duly sworn on oath, testified as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Thank you, Your Honor.  Dr. Cummings, I know it's late in the day, you've got a flight to catch, so I'll jump around and go as quickly as I can.  Okay? A.   Okay.

Q.   You showed the jury a number of tobacco industry statements on direct examination.  You're familiar with the 1962 Reader's Digest article that commented on the credibility of those statements, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=754
2123

A.   Yes, I'm familiar with the Reader's Digest articles.

MR. CARTER:  I would like to pull up one quote

from that, AIW-318.  It's from a 1962

Reader's Digest article. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Quote, "Tobacco industry spokesmen issued the standard rejoinder that the evidence was merely, quote, 'old data without new research findings,' end quote, but the statement sounded weaker and more pathetic than ever."

You're familiar with that, Doctor?

A.   Yes.  They're talking about the Royal College of Physicians' report that had been issued in 1962.  And that was the statement from the companies in relationship to that report.

Q.   You showed the jury video from congressional hearings in 1994, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you showed a clip where Mr. Johnston from R.J. Reynolds was being asked whether -- when they went down the line, whether he believed that nicotine in the product was addictive.  And he referred to -- started to refer to a classical definition before he was cut off by Congressman Weiden, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=755
2124

A.   Correct.

Q.   And there was, in fact, a classic definition that was used in the '64 Surgeon General's report that did require intoxication, correct?

A.   Yes, the World Health Organization criteria back in the '50s and early '60s was, you know, in order to be an addictive substance, it had to cause intoxication.  That was later changed in 1968, so just a few years later, because that excluded many drugs of abuse, cocaine and stimulants.  Barbiturates wouldn't have fallen in that category, for example.  Many of the opiates today wouldn't fall in that category.

Q.   Now, switching gears again to some of the design topics you've talked about.

As long as you burn tobacco, you agree that it's impossible to remove polycyclic hydrocarbons?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And even a cigarette that does not have nicotine in it, if you burn the tobacco, it will have those polycyclic hydrocarbons, the dangerous compounds that could cause cancer, correct?

A.   Yes, but the relevance is people wouldn't smoke cigarettes if they didn't contain nicotine or very low levels of nicotine repeatedly, which is what causes the problem, so � but yes, you would still get polycyclics

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=756
2125

measuring one cigarette at a time.

Q.   And all commercially-available cigarettes cause cancer, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   You're familiar with a letter that was written from the president of R.J. Reynolds, A.H. Galloway, to the head of R&D, Murray Senkus, in 1968, correct?

A.   Yes, this is research plans for the coming year.

MR. CARTER:  Let's pull that up and show it to

the jury.  May I see AS-173, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   September 23rd, 1968, the two individuals I just discussed, the top boss and the top scientist?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And let's go ahead and look at the first callout, please.

Under "Areas of Special Emphasis," will you read this to the jury, Doctor.

A.   "In cooperation with others, you should push the work concerning tobacco and health.  You should prepare a plan to foster any relationship with government personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of facts ultimately to gain their cooperation in proper research of the subject.  If there

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=757
2126

is a safer cigarette, let's continue and increase our efforts in this program.  Please prepare a plan to carry it out."

Q.   And when Galloway is referring to working with the government, around this time, the National Cancer Institute had established a program for a less hazardous cigarette that was also referred to as the Tobacco Working Group, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And R.J. Reynolds did participate in that NCI TWG effort?

A.   Yeah, they had two scientists, Dr. Senkus and Dr. Rodgman, participated on the committee in limited ways that are outlined in other internal documents, which you can share, if you'd like.

Q.   Philip Morris also had a representative scientist on the Tobacco Working Group, correct?

A.   Yes, they did.  I believe Dr. Osdene participated; Dr. Seligman, as well.

Q.   Dr. Fred Bock, who the jury has heard about from Roswell Park, was also part of that effort?

A.   Yes, he was.  They had a variety of people from academic institutions, the Department of Agriculture, the National Cancer Institute, as well as the cigarette companies.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=758
2127

Q.   And that program ran for nearly a decade before it was shut down, correct?

A.   Yes.  It went from '68, potentially, to the end of the '70s, 1978.

Q.   Among other things, the Tobacco Working Group looked at different designs regarding filters, it looked at different tobacco blends, ventilation, and porous paper, all with the purpose of trying to develop a less hazardous cigarette, correct?

A.   Well, they -- yes, that was the -- the goal was to make a less hazardous cigarette.  That was the goal of the program.

Q.   The Tobacco Working Group also looked into the idea of making cigarettes of higher nicotine levels, but lower tar, correct?

A.   That was one of the, you know, ideas that was proposed to jack up the nicotine in the product and people might smoke less of it.

Q.   The thinking being that the tars is what causes the cancer, and if you give the smokers what they're looking for in the nicotine while reducing the tar, that that might be a less hazardous cigarette?

A.   Yeah, or give people nicotine in other forms like patches, gum.  I mean, those are sort predating that idea, but give people the thing that they're

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=759
2128

smoking for without the harm.

Q. Another one of the things that TWG looked at, another idea for harm reduction was altering the pH of cigarettes, correct?

A.   Well, that was one of the design features.  So they looked at pH of the smoke, as well.

Q.   And you do not dispute that for decades, the public health community encouraged R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris to develop cigarettes with filters on them, correct?

A.   Yeah, we were of the opinion back from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, and to the '90s that, you know, a filtered cigarette was more than just an illusion. That really became apparent when we got to look at the internal business records and then look at the disease rates associated with using filtered and low tar.  We were essentially bamboozled.

Q.   The public health community encouraged Reynolds, Philip Morris, and the other manufacturers to develop low-tar and low-nicotine cigarettes over the years?

A.   The public health community was concerned with trying to discourage smoking in all forms, first and foremost.  And then if people were going to smoke, to try to minimize risk in whatever way possible.  Filters

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=760
2129

was one of the things that was mentioned.  Lower-yield products was also mentioned.  And, essentially, we didn't have a full and complete understanding of how the product had been engineered to keep people smoking for nicotine.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I move to strike

everything after the answer to my question. THE COURT:  The motion will be granted. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, pillars of the public health community, including Dr. Wynder who we've talked about, Dr. M.A.H. Russell, they are all quoted and reported as advocating "switch to filtered cigarettes for harm reduction," correct?

A. Sure. You can find comments of them suggesting that filters, again, might be a solution to this growing epidemic of lung cancer that we see.

Q. You talked to the jury during your presentation about the concept of compensation.  Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the -- as of 1971, the tar and nicotine ratings, pursuant to the government method, the FTC's Ogg method, those were required to appear on all ads pursuant to a consent decree between the manufacturers and the FTC, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=761
2130

A.   I believe that's the case, yes.

Q.   You showed a document towards the end of your presentation from 2008 where the FTC eventually rescinded that requirement, correct?

A.   Yes, because it was misleading consumers.

Q.   You know when the FTC was developing its testing methods, it sought the input of a number of participants in the industry including Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And the tobacco companies wrote a letter --Reynolds specifically wrote a letter to the FTC advising them that no two smokers smoke in the same way and that there would be limitations to a standard machine-measured yield?

A.   Yeah, I don't think it was a surprise to the FTC at that time if the standard machine -- that people smoked differently than the machine.  And, yeah, the industry wrote a letter essentially saying that to the FTC, so that was not a secret.  What was secret is how the product was engineered in a way that basically, you know, to facilitate compensation, to make it easier to compensate.

Q.   And we know it wasn't a secret, because when the FTC announced its method, it issued a press release

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=762
2131

in 1967 where it actually used the same language that was in the tobacco company's submission about no two smokers smoking the same way.

You've seen that press release, right?

A.   Sure.  I'm sure that was taken from the industry's language, but I've seen the press release from FTC.  As I said, it wasn't a secret then that people smoked differently.

Q.   And specifically with respect to compensation, that concept was covered in popular media, including Consumer Reports?

A.   Yeah, mainly as a topic of compensation, was smoking more cigarettes.  If you switched down to a lower-tar or nicotine product, maybe you would end up smoking more of that product.  But what was less understood is within cigarette compensation.  You know, people could smoke the same amount, but they would change how they would smoke.

Q.   Let's look at the May 1976 issue of Consumer Reports.

MR. CARTER:  It's AS-354.  If we pull � let's

go right to the story.  Call up the highlights,

please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   In Consumer Reports, they wrote, "Many public

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=763
2132

health officials would applaud a switch from cigarettes high in tar and nicotine to cigarettes low in those harmful substances, at least for those who can't quit smoking entirely.  The less tar in cigarette smoke, the better.  But a long history of research on the addictive nature of nicotine suggests that cigarettes low in nicotine may well do more harm than good to those who already smoke."

Did I read that correctly? A.   That's right.

Q.   In reference to the addictive nature of nicotine in Consumer Reports in 1976, correct? A.   Sure.  This is in Consumer Reports. Q.   Let's look at the next section of callouts.

"Unfortunately, however, the amount of nicotine in the bloodstream does not necessarily decline when there is less nicotine in the smoke.  Nicotine is an addicting agent for most smokers.  When cigarette smoke contains less nicotine than such smokers are accustomed to, their bodies simply contrive ways to get more smoke."

Did I read that correctly? A.   Yeah. Q.   I think we have one more set of callouts.

MR. CARTER:  Actually, let's skip to the last

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=764
2133

one. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   "In short, human smokers are not smoking machines.  They do not necessarily smoke a low-nicotine cigarette in the same way that they smoke a high-nicotine cigarette, nor do they smoke the same number of cigarettes when they switch to a low-nicotine brand from a high-nicotine brand." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   They're not just talking about a change in the number, they're also talking about changes in the way that individuals smoke the cigarette?

A.   Yeah, that's why the industry developed human smoking mimic machines, to mimic more carefully human consumption.  And they use that information to engineer their products.

Q.   You talked on your direct examination about an exhibit that was a 1982 letter between in-house lawyers at Reynolds discussing Dr. DiMarco. Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you told the jury that Dr. DiMarco wanted to make a less carcinogenic cigarette, but that the lawyers did not want him to do so.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=765
2134

Do you recall that?

A.   That's what was in the letter.

Q.   Now, you're familiar with Premier, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Premier is different than a traditional cigarette.  Traditional cigarette burns tobacco when it is lit, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the idea behind Premier was that it would heat but not burn the tobacco, correct?

A.   Yeah, you didn't burn any tobacco, so it wasn't technically a cigarette.  Sort of like an early version of an e-cigarette, except it used carbon like a charcoal briquet as the heat source to heat up beads of nicotine in glycerin that were contained in a metal tube inside what looked like a cigarette, but there was no tobacco to be burned in Premier.

Q.   And you know that Reynolds invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in trying to develop Premier, correct?

A.   Yes.

They did extensive tests? They did.

They did biological tests? Yes, they did.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=766
2135

Q.        They  did  inhalation  tests?

A.        Yes.

Q.   They did skin painting?

A.   They painted the, you know, condensate generated from Premier on the backs of mice and compared that to the condensate from a conventional cigarette.

Q.   They published the results of all those tests in a monograph that was publicly available?

A.   Well, not widely publicly available.  You could write to Reynolds and get it.  I did.  I have the monograph.  It's, you know, a compendium of some of the work, not all of the work that they did.

Q.   And you believe that developing Premier was a responsible thing for Reynolds to do?

A.   Yes, given that their conventional products, you know, caused premature deaths of one and two users.

Q. After Premier failed in the marketplace, Reynolds didn't give up. They developed Eclipse, correct?

A.   Well, let's be clear.  Premier really wasn't given a fair chance in the marketplace.  It was pulled. Of course, it was competing against the conventional cigarettes.  And at the time when it was marketed, Reynolds didn't tell their customers that their conventional cigarettes caused harm and there was an

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=767
2136

alternative to go to.

It was sold in two test markets, St. Louis and Phoenix -- or Tucson, rather, Arizona.  Those were the two test markets.  It was pulled after a few months.

And then they went on a few years later to do a different version of a heating tobacco product called Eclipse.

Q.   And that's what I was asking.  After Premier, Eclipse came next, right?

A.   Yeah, Eclipse was, I think, after Mr. Barbose died in 1996.  They introduced it in test markets in Nashville and then in Nebraska.  And then a few years later, it went national.  And then recently, Reynolds has withdrawn it from the market.

Q.   You also talked about a document from Dr. Teague that was -- referred to a Nordine study, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you indicated -- well, strike that.

It talked -- one of the ideas was to provide other products or nonconventional cigarettes to meet the needs of the consumer, correct?

A.   Yeah, that was No. 3.

Q.   So option No. 3?

A.   Yeah.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=768
2137

Q.   You talked about Nicorette and smoking-cessation products.  In keeping with option No. 3, you're familiar with ZONNIC nicotine gum.  That's a nicotine replacement therapy available today?

MR. CLARK:  Your Honor, excuse me.  Can we approach?

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

MR. CLARK:  I believe we're getting into testimony about ZONNIC.  This a product that is not owned by Reynolds.  This is completely irrelevant. 403 is my objection.

MR. CARTER:  It's a sister company of Reynolds. Reynolds' scientists, R&D folks have developed it after it was purchased from another company.  And I'll ask about two questions on it.

He specifically said in his direct examination that to this day the companies haven't done anything.  And he will agree with me, if we get there, that under option 3, they do have ZONNIC available today and that he thinks it's a good idea.

MR. CLARK:  But it's not Reynolds.  It's not this defendant.  It's a sister company, like he just said.

THE COURT:  Well, did you get into anything

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=769
2138

about ZONNIC in direct?

MR. CLARK:  No, Your Honor.

MR. CARTER:  They did.  They talked about nicotine gum.  This is a nicotine gum.

MR. CLARK:  We talked about Philip Morris's pressure on Merrell Dow relating to its marketing of Nicorette gum, but we never got into ZONNIC.

MR. CARTER:  And that's why I want to bring up this topic.  The jurors are left with the impression regarding efforts about nicotine gum, and he talked about what was done to this day, so they brought this time period into play.  I think it's fair to tell the other side of the story.

MR. CLARK:  If this wouldn't have been Philip Morris that was messing around with Merrell Dow, we might have a different story.  But this was a defendant in this case that was manipulating and trying to put pressure on one of its suppliers to cease advertising and marketing a product that was going to help smokers to quit.  This is something totally different.  This is a product that is not made by this company.  It is a sister company and has no relationship to the Merrell Dow situation. We didn't open any doors to get into the activities of a nonparty in this case to make any type of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=770
2139

product.

THE COURT:  We've got into a lot of industry-wide issues in this trial, so I will overrule the objection and allow the question. MR. CARTER:  Thank you. MR. CLARK:  Okay. (End of bench conference.)

MR. CARTER:  May I continue, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes, you may. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Back to where we were, Doctor.

ZONNIC nicotine gum as a nicotine replacement therapy is available today, including in the state of Florida?

A.   True.

Q.   And you are a supporter of that product, correct?

A.   Sure.  Anything that would help people get off cigarettes.

Q.   The product was developed by a company named Niconovum that the parent company of R.J. Reynolds subsequently purchased, correct? A.   That's right.

Q.   And ZONNIC is sold today.  And you can go into a 7-Eleven and see it right up at the counter?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=771
2140

A.   Yes.  I'm not sure -- you know, the distribution was somewhat limited, but I know 7-Eleven is one of the places they are selling; other gas stations.  Up in my area, it's Kangaroo gas station, I've seen it.

Q.   You think that that product placement is a good thing, because that's the way that people buy cigarettes and it's good to have the nicotine replacement therapy in the same locations and in the same types of size as the cigarettes?

A.   Yeah, make it cheaper -- that's most important -- and make it available in places where people are buying their cigarettes.  I think that's important.  And they haven't quite made it cheaper, but they, at least, got the location better.

Q.   You talked about things the companies have or have not admitted up to today in public statements.  I'd like to --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- show you a couple from Reynolds' current website.  You're familiar with R.J. Reynolds' current website, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And you talked about how a smoker can find -- I don't know if you talked about it.  But you know that a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=772
2141

smoker, if they want to go to Reynolds' website today and find out the list of additives that are contained in a brand, there are ways to do that on the website, correct?

A.   Just to be very frank with you, a partial list. And there is quite a bit of limited information.  But, yes, better than what it used to be.  You can go on and they give you major ingredients -- not all the ingredients -- and the dosing that is in different brands.  But you can go in and search, you know, a particular brand or brand variety, and it will give you a list of, you know, tobacco and then some of the major ingredients, like water being one of the major ingredients in tobacco.

Q.   You're familiar with the section on the website entitled "Guiding Principles and Beliefs," correct?

A.   Sure.

MR. CARTER:  I would like to pull up

Demonstrative 39, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This is from Reynolds' website today, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And on Reynolds' website, if the jurors go there after the trial is over, they will see, quote, "No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and without

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=773
2142

risks."

Did I read that correctly? A.   Yes, that's new.  That was not, you know, published, I think, until recently.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, I move to strike everything after "Did I read that correctly?" THE COURT:  I'll deny that. MR. CARTER:  Thank you. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Let's continue and look at another portion of the same area, another bullet point.

"Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the risk for serious disease."

If someone goes on the website in 2015, that is there, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you agree with that?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Let's look at another bullet.

Under the Tobacco Consumer section, "The best course of action for tobacco consumers concerned about their health is to quit."

If you go to the website, that's there, correct?

A.   Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=774
2143

Q. And let's look at the next callout. Under the heading "Making decisions regarding tobacco use, Reynolds directs website visitors, quote, 'R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company believes that individuals should rely on the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control, and other public health and medical officials when making decisions regarding smoking.'"

And then they provide some hyperlinks to various content from those groups, correct?

A.   Right.  I think people ought to rely on the 2014 report.  Those major conclusions that we showed are quite accurate.

Q.   And we talked about the additive section. Let's just show the jury quickly, here, you could view the ingredients by brand.  You select a brand from the dropdown and the brand style, and then items pop up and are populated, correct?

A.   Right.  You can see some of the additives there like diammonium phosphate, ammonia hydrochloride, high fructose corn syrup, which, actually, Reynolds holds the patent for.  Used widely in food products, of course.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Ryan, you can pull that

down. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   The jury has heard a lot about Dr. Rodgman.  He

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=775
2144

was hired as an analytic chemist in the summer of 1954 by R.J. Reynolds, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You believe he was a good scientist and a good scientist, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Reynolds put him in a lab and asked him to study what was in cigarette smoke, correct?

A.   He studied it and summarized it to senior management.

Q.   And he actually developed many of the technologies that others that followed used to identify and view the components of cigarette smoke, correct?

A.   Yeah, he was involved in developing some of the technology for isolating chemicals from any source.

Q.   You talked about a memoranda from Dr. Rodgman to Dr. Hoover at Reynolds, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And in that first sentence, Dr. Rodgman confirmed that benzo[a]pyrene was the first polycyclic hydrocarbon reported in 1954, right?

A.   Yes, that was published in 1954.  Actually, identified originally at Brown & Williamson in '53 or '52, as I recall.

Q.   Dr. Rodgman also wrote that eight of the

polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated from smoke were known to produce cancer in mice, correct?

A.   Right.  He was just summarizing what was in the published literature at that point, I think.  You can find that statement in other places in the public literature.

Q.   And speaking of the public literature, subsequent to that, in 1959, Reader's Digest had an article where they specifically referenced the content of polycyclic hydrocarbons formed by the combustion of tobacco smoke, correct?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   Dr. Rodgman, in that memo you showed the jury, did write that there was, quote, "No evidence that any of those compounds will produce cancer in man," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He went on to discuss five research approaches that should be pursued to potentially reduce the presence of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And he talked about which ones he thought had promise?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Reynolds, subsequent to that memo, tried to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=777
2146

carry out those plans that Rodgman described, correct?

A.   Sure, he figured out actually how to reduce the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Hexane is one of the main methods he talked about.  But it had -- you know, created an off taste to the tobacco.  So rather than do that, they left the carcinogens in.

Q.   The jury has heard about submissions to the Surgeon General advisory committee.  Dr. Rodgman was thanked by name by the Surgeon General in the '64 report, correct?

A.   Well, you know, he may have been.  There were a number of scientists from the companies, and the companies themselves were thanked.  So anybody who contributed anything was sent a thank-you letter and acknowledged in the report.

Q.   And subsequent to the report, in 1969, Dr. Rodgman presented a speech to the American Chemical Society about the composition of cigarette smoke, correct?

A.   He did.

MR. CARTER:  Let's pull up AT-956, please. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   This is a copy of Dr. Rodgman's speech, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if we turn to page 2, he wrote, "During the past two decades, the number of identified components in tobacco smoke has increased at a tremendous rate because of the efforts of research personnel both within and outside of the tobacco industry," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   He goes on, for those who were in attendance, he draws pictures -- you know, chemical diagrams of the components in smoke, correct?

A.   Yeah, chemistry conference.  So that's who the audience is, yes.

Q.   He drew pictures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?

A.   Yes, among other things.

Q.   Benzo[a]pyrene?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Even drew a picture of nicotine molecules?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Since 1996, in every trial that you've appeared involving an individual smoker, you have always testified that the smoker was addicted to nicotine, correct?

A.   That is correct.  I wouldn't involve myself in a case and waste the lawyer's time or anybody else's time if I didn't think the person was addicted.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=779
2148

Q.   Doctor, you believe that every daily smoker is addicted, correct?

A.   Anybody who's a persistent daily smoker over a long period of time, yes, they're addicted and the strength of that addiction is basically measured by the Heaviness of Smoking Index, a very well-validated measure of nicotine dependence widely utilized both in the scientific literature as well as by the industry themselves.

Q.   You mentioned the Heaviness of Smoking Index. The way that that test is organized, you can score a zero on that test and still have a rating of addiction?

A.   If you're a persistent daily smoker, yeah, a zero would mean you're in the mild to low dependence category.  And there is a little score that goes from zero to six.  And if you're in the mid range, it's moderate.  If you're a five or six, you're considered heavily dependent.

Mr. Barbose, by my assessment, was heavily dependent.

Q.   Even if someone smokes only one cigarette a day, if they smoke them daily, you believe that smoker is addicted?

A.   Yes, I do, if they do it on a persistent daily basis over, you know, months, years, decades.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=780
2149

Absolutely.

Q.   The seven criteria that you utilized for your work in this case do not tell you whether someone is able to quit smoking or not, do they?

A.   No, they tell me by strength of addiction how hard they're going to have in quitting.  So the higher you score on the Heaviness of Smoking Index, the two items, the amount of smoke per day and time of first cigarette of the day, the greater the likelihood they're going to have a hard time quitting.

That's what the data show when you follow people prospectively for decades.

Q.   You believe that a smoker is fully responsible for making the choice to try to quit, correct?

A.   No.  What I have said is that, you know, it's a shared responsibility.  Obviously, the manufacturer has a huge responsibility in making sure that the consumer is fully informed.  Once the consumer is fully informed, then it's up to the smoker.

Q.   I'm going to get you a copy of the Denton trial testimony.

A.   Sure.  If you want to save time, I can comment on the Denton trial.  Because since that trial, I've changed my opinion.  I think it was taken out of context.  But if you want to show it to the jury, go

	MR. CARTER:  Sorry.  295, line 9.

BY MR.
	CARTER:

Q.
	"Question:  You believe that the smoker is

fully
	responsible for making the choice to quit; yes or

no?
	


	"Answer:  Yes, making the quit attempt."


	Did I read that correctly?

A.
	You read that correctly.

Q.
	And that was the testimony you provided at the

Dentor
	l trial in 2012, correct?

A.
	That's right.  And I have said that that was --

I regret making that statement, that certainly it's a
	
Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

shared responsibility, which is what I've said in every other trial since.

Q.   Now, when you were at Roswell Park, you never told anyone who came to your clinic that it would be impossible for them to quit, did you?

A.   No.

Q.   And was there any time period where it was impossible for Mr. Barbose to quit smoking?

A.   He would make a quit attempt, but obviously he struggled to quit his entire life.  Actually, you know, he started making his quit attempts in the '80s.  And for a decade, he failed until he got so sick he couldn't smoke anymore.

Q.   And so my question, was there any time period where it was impossible for Mr. Barbose to quit smoking?

A.   He made quit attempts, so it wasn't impossible.

Q.   I think this is the last one, if you'd refer to your deposition.  You still have that in front of you?

"Question:  Was there any time period where it was impossible for Mr. Barbose to quit smoking?"

And you provided the answer, "No," correct? A.   Correct.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Doctor.  I have no further questions.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ms. Yates, you may proceed.

MS. YATES:  Thank you, Your Honor.  The good news is I'm pulling out pages, so I'm shortening it Bear with me for 30 seconds, if you would.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS. YATES:

Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings. A.   Good afternoon.

Q.   We're going to do this as quickly as we can. Okay?  I apologize if I'm rushing. A.   I'll try to assist you. Q.   Trying to get out of here.  Okay.

Mr. Carter spent some time with you going through the warnings that appeared on the packets of cigarettes over the years.  You remember that? A.   Yes. Q.   And we looked specifically starting in 1966,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=784
2153

and then we got to the rotating warnings in 1985. Do you remember that?

A.   Yes.

Q. And the 1985 Surgeon General warnings to the present, they never said, "Smoking causes lung cancer unless you smoke lights," correct?

A.   They didn't say that.

Q.   All right.  And the � from 1985 to the present, the Surgeon General warnings on the pack of cigarettes never said, "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces your -- reduces serious risk to your health unless you smoke lights"?  Never said that, right?

A.   No.

Q.   And in 1971, the cigarette ads were no longer permitted on television or radio, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q. And at that time, there were more print ads, right?

A.   Yeah, they shifted their advertising to billboards and print and sports promotions.  And, actually, their advertising expenditures went up.

Q.   Did I ask you about advertising expenditures?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  I just asked you if, in 1972, the industry began placing more print ads, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=785
2154

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the Surgeon General's warnings had to be placed on every single print ad, right?

A.   From '72 on.

Q.   And you have a collection -- I think you called it a tobacco advertising archive, but you have a collection of over 10,000 cigarette advertisements; is that right?

A.   Actually, it's larger than that.  10,000 that I personally collected.  Then I've gone to the industry websites where they have their ads and collected those. There are over 60,000, I think, on the Philip Morris website.

Q.   So more than 10,000?

A.   True.

Q.   All right.  And in your review of all those thousands of cigarette ads, you know that Philip Morris has never said on any of its cigarettes, whether it be Marlboro full-flavored or Marlboro Lights, that they were safe, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   Nor have they said they were safer than any other brand, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Better for you than any other brand?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=786
2155

A.   They didn't say that.

Q.   Less dangerous for you than any other brand?

A.   Well, they didn't say that.  They said milder, less irritating to your throat.  Those were, you know, Philip Morris ads.  I think we saw some examples of those.

Q.   They never said Marlboro regular or Marlboro Lights were less addictive than any other brand?

A.   No, they never mentioned addiction.

Q.   Never said easier to quit than any other brand?

A.   No.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, you are, I think it's fair to say, very critical of the tobacco companies and their so-called behavior on suggesting that smokers switch to lights.  I think you even said it was the lights fraud, right?

A.   That's what it's considered today by people who have studied the effects of marketing of light cigarettes and the fact that the -- as the products changed and evolved to the lower-yield products, the relative risks of cigarettes went up.  So when you compare people who switched to the filters and did most of their smoking with filters and low-tar, their odds of getting lung cancer, COPD, and heart disease were greater than those who had smoked the filtered --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=787
2156

unfiltered cigarettes from decades earlier.

Q.   Do you remember my question?

A.   I do.

Q.   What was it?

A.   You were asking about my views on light cigarettes and how critical I've been of the industry, and I was giving you the basis for why I'm critical. And cigarettes got worse.

Q.   You were repeating what you had already said on direct?

A.   No, sir.  No, ma'am.  Sorry.

Q.   Okay.  All right.  Let's make sure we're on the same page.

A.   Sure.

Q.   You are very critical of the tobacco companies because of the switch to light cigarettes?

A.   Yeah.  They're more dangerous today, yes.

Q.   I think we've heard that several times.

And, sir, you, in your own publications, have talked about the benefit of switching to light cigarettes, correct?

A.   I did earlier on, yeah, before the internal business documents became available, because I was, like many of the public health community who was bamboozled by marketing of lights and low tar, thinking they might

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=788
2157

be better.

Q.   So in 1997, sir, you published an article in a journal called "Tobacco Control," right? A.   That's right.

MS. YATES:  PMU70976, please. May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, would you like one? THE COURT:  Please. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   And the title of this article, Dr. Cummings, is "Predictors of Smoking Cessation in a Cohort of Adult Smokers Followed For Five Years," right? A.   That's right. Q.   1997 published? A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And if we turn to page S61, sir --A.   Sure. Q.   I don't know if we have it.

MS. YATES:  Do we have it?  We do. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   In your publication, you state, quote, "On a practical level, the findings from this research have both public policy and treatment implications." Did I read that correctly?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=789
2158

A.   You did.

Q.   You, in fact, followed -- there were 13,000 smokers in this study, correct?

A.   Actually 20,000.  We were able to track down 13,000 after five years and were reporting on this particular paper.

Q.   All right.  So there were two questionnaires, 1998, 1993.  You might have started with 20,000, but you were able to follow up with 13,000, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   All right.  And if we go further down, page S61, sir �

A.   Sure.

Q.   You see that?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   It says, "From a treatment perspective, the findings from this study highlight the importance of helping smokers, especially heavier smokers, overcome their need for nicotine.  The means to achieve this therapeutic goal could take many forms including, but not limited to, the use of nicotine replacement products, gradual reduction of the number of cigarettes smoked daily, and having smokers switch to cigarettes with less nicotine."

Did I read that correctly, sir?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=790
2159

A.   Yes, you did.

Q.   And you also know, sir, that the public health community in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, the Surgeon General was encouraging smokers to switch to filtered, low-tar cigarettes if they weren't going to quit, correct?

A.   Yes, that's true.

Q.   And people in the public health community were of the opinion that if you got lower tar and nicotine, it would be better for you so long as you did not compensate, correct?

A.   That was the assumption, yeah.

Q.   And not all smokers compensate, do they, sir?

A.   That's true.  You can find some that don't. But on average, you'll see compensation, people who switch down or switch up.  So if you start at a low level and go to a full-flavored product, you'll see compensation in the other direction.  People smoke for their nicotine.

Q.   Sir, not all smokers compensate?

A.   That's what I said.

Q.   You are aware, for example, of ads put out by the American Cancer Society in 1967, "The less tar and nicotine you inhale, the better."  You're familiar with that, sir?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=791
2160

A.   I am, yeah.

Q.   And public service messages put out by the American Cancer Society on the same issue?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Correct?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   And the theory behind the less tar and nicotine, sir -- the theory behind the less tar and nicotine, you inhale it better, is that dose-response relationship you talked about earlier, fair?

A.   Fair.  I mean, actually, if you get less tar, low tar, you don't get the disease.  So less tar makes sense.  The problem is, didn't -- the public health community didn't have an understanding of how the product had been engineered in ways that facilitated compensation, so that people were smoking for nicotine, and the tar came along with the nicotine.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I need to clear something up. You were shown -- you looked at the verified work sheet that was filled out in this case, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And we went through the brands, and there was a slide that showed the brands.  Do you remember that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you were also aware, sir, that there was an

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=792
2161

amended verified worksheet, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And that's an opportunity where you can correct, add to, change your responses, right?

A.   That's my understanding.

Q.   And you're aware, sir, that in the amended verified worksheet, the brand history provided in this lawsuit is identical to the original worksheet, correct?

A.   Correct.  Did not change in the amended worksheet.

Q.   And you testified in your deposition -- well, let me back up.

Today, I thought I heard you testify -- maybe I was wrong -- that there was a switch to Marlboros in the 1970s, sir.  But based on a totality of the witnesses, you testified previously it was in the 1980s.

A.   No, actually, I think I was mentioning Mr. Barbose's brother Sam who had mentioned that he was smoking Marlboro cigarettes when he graduated high school, which I think was in the early '60s, as I recall.

Q.   So, sir, is it your testimony today that the totality of the evidence of all the witnesses supports a switch to Marlboros in the 1980s, or are you now saying it's earlier?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=793
2162

A.   I'm saying it's earlier.  There is evidence he was smoking Marlboros earlier, and that clearly Marlboro was a brand that he was smoking.  In the '80s, he was smoking Marlboro Lights.

Q.   Do you have your deposition up there still, sir?

A.   I do.

MS. YATES:  Your Honor, I don't � do you have a copy of Dr. Cummings' deposition? THE COURT:  No, I don't. MS. YATES:  Allow me. THE COURT:  Thank you. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, would you turn to page 178 --

A.   Okay.

Q.   � line 23.

MR. CLARK:  170 what?

MS. YATES:  Line 23.  We're going through 179, line 7. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   "Question:  When do you believe that Mr. Barbose first became a regular smoker of Marlboros?

"Answer:  It's unclear from the record.  It could have been in the '60s, '70s, and there is testimony he was -- there is testimony he was smoking

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=794
2163

Marlboros.

"So it's unclear when that became his regular brand.

"Question:  Fair enough.  It was clear in the 1980s, based on the totality of all the witnesses. There was no dispute that he was smoking Marlboro at that time."

Did I read that correctly? A.   You did.

MR. CLARK:  For rule of completeness, can you continue down through line 18?

THE COURT:  That's fine.

MS. YATES:  Continue.

Start with line 8?

MR. CLARK:  Yes.  Keep reading where you left off through line 18. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   "But what's the earliest that Mrs. Barbose puts Mr. Barbose smoking Marlboro as his regular brand?

"Answer:  The earliest she did, I believe --and as I mentioned, there was a little bit of conflict between the testimony that she gave for the verified worksheet.  But on page 192, she said that she thinks John was smoking Marlboro before they moved to Florida in '84, because he was collecting the coupons to get

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

shirts.  And she recalled a black shirt with the Marlboro insignia on it."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

MS. YATES:  Okay? MR. CLARK:  Thank you. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   You talked briefly about a Barbara Goodman memo from 1975.  Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And there were nine smokers in that study, right?

A.   Yeah.  I think I mentioned it was a small sample.

Q.   Right.  Five Marlboro Reds and four Marlboro Lights, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And they were using equipment -- they switched cigarettes and they were using smoker recording equipment to measure puff volume, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And you know, sir, that only three of the five smokers had a larger smoke intake on Marlboro Lights than Marlboro Reds, right?

A.   That's right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=796
2165

Q.   And the results were not statistically significant, sir.

A.   Not in that study.

Q.   Right.  And two of the five smokers actually decreased their intake, correct?

A.   Sure.  When you went from the light smokers and they switched because they -- what they did is they switched the light smokers off to the full flavored. They -- they compensated in a reverse way.  So they, you know, changed -- they smoked less intently.  So you need to know who you're looking at.  And it's nine subjects, but it's nine subjects within subject design.  So they were looking at, you know, people smoking their regular brand.  Then they switched them to the other brands and looked at their recordings.  And they looked at the consistency of the findings, and the findings generally are consistent in showing that most of the smokers compensated.  If you were a light smoker and went to full flavored, you puffed less hard, less intently.  If you went from a regular to a light, you took more puffs, deeper puffs on the cigarette.

Q.   Do you remember my question?

A.   I do.

Q.   What was it?

A.   You were asking about the limited number of

understand how they did the study.

MS. YATES:  Move to strike as nonresponsive,

Your Honor.  No question pending.

THE COURT:  I'll grant that objection. MS. YATES:  Let's go to PT4819. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   Doctor, do you recall discussing this document on direct?

A.   I didn't memorize the number.  Sorry.

Q.   Sorry.  It's about Benson & Hedges.

A.   Yes.  This is the focus group study?

Q.   Right.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   There is no evidence in this case, sir, that Mr. Barbose ever smoked Benson & Hedges brand of cigarette, right?

A.   No evidence.  I would agree with that, although this particular study was light cigarette smokers, not just Benson & Hedges.  They were doing the study for the brand marketing of Benson & Hedges, but they were looking at people who were smoking light and ultra light cigarettes.

Q.   And they were looking to introduce a new Benson & Hedges cigarette, right?

A.   That was the goal, yes.  They were interviewing

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=799
2168

people who smoked light and ultra light cigarettes to get their reasons why they selected those products.

MS. YATES:  Well � and let's � let's take a

look at what they say, then.  Do you have PT4819? Your Honor in light of time, I don't want to

set the ELMO up.  May I approach and read from --

no, I don't need to.  Look at that.  Okay.

Go to under Methodology.  It's Bates 00.  It

doesn't help.  I can show you, though.  Yes.  Okay.

At the bottom there, group research. BY MS. YATES:

Q.   Doctor, in this Benson & Hedges focus group, under Methodology, quote, it says, "Because group research is qualitative rather than quantitative in nature, it serves to develop rather than prove hypotheses.  Although the findings reported here are valid for this sample, they are indicative rather than definitive and should not be generalized to the population at large unless their reliability is checked by further large scale research."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Sir, you talked about the phrase "psychological crutch."  Do you remember that testimony?

A.   Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=800
2169

Q.   And, sir, you know � you were reading from a Philip Morris memo of January 1964 that used that phrase?

A.   Yes.  They were referring to a public relations campaign to give smokers a psychological crutch and self-rationale to continue to smoke after the Surgeon General's report had come out.

Q.   This document was written roughly two weeks after the release of this 1964 Surgeon General report, right?

A.   Correct, January 29th, George Weissman to Joe Cullman.

Q.   And Mr. Weissman's note -- he was not a scientist, right?

A.   No.  He was on the board of directors of Philip Morris and was the architect of Marlboro cigarettes dating from the 19 -- mid 1950s.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I will get you out much quicker if you just answer my question.

Dr. Weissman was not a scientist, correct?

A.   He was not a doctor, that's correct.  He was basically a salesperson and an expert in advertising.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, just as you didn't create the phrase "psychological crutch," you know that Dr. Weissman also did not create that phrase in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=801
2170

context of smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.  He didn't correct -- you know, create the phrase "psychological crutch."  I think that's a phrase that you see a lot of people use.

Q.   Well, sir, the term "psychological crutch" was actually used in the 1964 Surgeon General's report, correct?

A.   True, but in a very different context than what you're referring to.

Q.   It's actually used in the part of the report that refers to beneficial effects of tobacco, right?

A.   True.

Q.   Okay.  And, in fact, on page 2 -- and let me know if you need me to pull up Mr. Weissman's memo -- he actually -- Mr. Weissman's memo on page 2 actually refers to the Surgeon General report the very next page after the term "psychological crutch" appears, right? You know that.

A.   The whole memo is on the Surgeon General's report.

Q.   And they actually refer to that section, right?

A.   Of the report?  I'm not sure if they refer to that section that you're referring to, but I don't deny that the term "psychological crutch" you can find in the Surgeon General's report.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=802
2171

Q.   And you've actually done a search of Philip Morris documents looking for that term, "psychological crutch," right?

A.   Yes.  I was asked in a deposition whether I had ever researched it, I hadn't.  So I went and did a little, you know, keyword search.  And I didn't find any other references to it.

Q.   Right.  And after that search, you've never seen it in another document, correct?

A.   I haven't found one yet.

Q.   Eighty-eight million documents?

A.   Eighty million.

Q.   Eighty.  I'm sorry.  I thought you said 88 earlier.

Sir, you talked about a dispute between Dow Chemical, one of the suppliers of components for the cigarettes that go into Philip Morris cigarettes, right?

A.   Additives.

Q.   Additives.  I'm sorry.

A.   Propolyne glycol and glycerin reduce the harshness so you can inhale the smoke.

Q.   And you know, sir, that Nicorette gum was proved by the FDA in January 1984, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And it went on the market in March 1984, three

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=803
2172

months   after   its   approval.

A.        Yes.

Q.   And that's a very fast approval for the FDA, right?

A.   It had been in review for about two years because it had been approved over in Europe in '82. But, yes, relatively speaking these days, that's pretty fast to get a drug on the market.

Q.   And Nicorette gum has been on the market continuously since 1984?

A.   True.

Q.   And in the four months after the FDA approved Nicorette, Merrell Dow spent about $4 million to launch the product, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And, in fact, the Public Health Service recognized in 1989 that the result of a massive promotional campaign, Nicorette was one of the fastest selling prescription products ever introduced, correct?

A.   Yes.  That's in the Surgeon General's report. I know it well because I wrote it.  And I wasn't aware of the Dow/Philip Morris connection until the documents became available.

Q.   And a lot of people tried Nicorette gum when it first came out, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=804
2173

A.   They sure did.

Q.   And the estimate is four to six million smokers tried Nicorette gum as of 1989, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And your testimony is that John Barbose was one of those four to six million, correct?

A.   There was testimony, I think from his wife, that he had used the Nicorette gum in the '80s, I believe.

Q.   Right.  We don't have a prescription from a Nicorette gum in this case, right?

A.   No.

Q.   We don't have any medical records showing that a prescription was written, right?

A.   We don't have any medical records dating into the 1980s as far as I'm aware.

Q.   Right.  The first medical record -- other than the note from Dr. Wirt in 1995, the first medical records that we have to look at are April 30, 1996, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So whatever dispute Philip Morris and Dow Chemical were having, your testimony is it did not prevent Mr. Barbose from getting the use of Nicorette gum on several occasions, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=805
2174

A.   We don't know whether it had any effect one way or the other, but certainly there is testimony from his wife that he used the Nicorette.

Q.   And Nicorette was a very successful gum and is still on the market today, correct?

A.   Well, as a top-selling gum.  It's not a particularly effective quit-smoking aide because it --it's slow delivery and it's hard to use, because if you chew it too fast, you get hiccups and it causes indigestion.

Q.   Did I ask you about the side effects of Nicorette gum, sir?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Briefly, counsel went through the RJR website and certain statements that are on that website.

A.   Yes.

Q.   You know, sir, that the same or similar statements appear on the Philip Morris website, correct?

A.   Sure.  I've been tracking the Philip Morris websites from 1999 forward and they have evolved over time.  And so those statements have evolved.  So when they first went up, they actually weren't quite as clear as they are today.

Q.   One thing I would like to -- would you please take a look at your notes on page 9 of your -- do you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=806
2175

still have your notes there? A.   I do.

Q.   And on page 9, you have "time to first cigarette."  And this is part of the Heaviness of Smoking Index.  Do you see that? A.   Yes.

Q.   Time to first cigarette.  And you cite testimony from Deborah, Dyanna and Samuel Barbose, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you don't cite any testimony from the person who actually lived with the man, woke up in the morning with him, Mrs. Barbose, correct? A.   That's correct.

MS. YATES:  Nothing further, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  Any redirect? MR. CLARK:  Very, very briefly, Your Honor. I've got a question for the bailiff to hand to you.  Sorry to interrupt.

THE COURT:  Counsel, you may approach the bench.

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

THE COURT:  This is the question.  I will ask this question at the end and direct any other

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=807
2176

questions that � well, I guess, yes, are there � is there any objection to the question, how many cases has Dr. Cummings' passed on? MS. YATES:  No objection.

MR. CLARK:  I don't know.  Let me think about it for a minute.  But maybe I'm -- if I don't ask him myself, I'll -- we'll talk about it after I get done with him when it's the appropriate time to discuss questions.

(End of bench conference.)

THE COURT:  Counsel is going to proceed with redirect.  Then we'll get to any juror questions at the very end then.  All right.  Thank you.

MR. CLARK:  Thank you for your patience and your time, Dr. Cummings.  I know it's getting late.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   You talked about Mark Twain on our direct examination.  You also talked about him a little bit on cross-examination.  And one of the statements he had made was something along the lines of he has tried to quit thousands of times, right?

One of his other favorite quotes is, "Lies, damn lies and statistics," right? A.   Right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=808
2177

Q.   With that thought in mind, what is the rest of the story regarding the 30 million people, the 60 million people who have quit since 1964?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, argumentative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  The millions of people who have quit since 1964 -- and we heard, you know, 60 million Americans and so on, you know.  I think I had explained that that's just really classifying people at a point in time as to whether they were current, never, or former smokers.  Former smokers are defined as having quit.  Many of those smokers end of relapsing back to smoking.  So it's not a good indication of how hard or -- it is to stop.

If you follow people as I've done, where I've taken thousands of smokers and followed them over decades, you'll find that most people have tried to quit, most people have failed.  They've tried again. They've failed.  And that's basically the reality of cigarette smoking.  And many of those 60 million smokers in addition, I pointed out, when they finally got around to smoking, they include the patients diagnosed with lung cancer, COPD, heart disease, and all the illnesses that are related to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=809
2178

smoking.  And so that's -- it's all contained within

that 60 million figure. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And the slide we have up here is -- it shows how that figure is calculated.

A.   Correct.

Q. All right. I'm going to skip around a little bit. I apologize for that, but I've just got my notes here.  That's all.

There was a small segment of discussion regarding the Fairness Doctrine.

A.   Right.

Q.   And I would like you to explain to the jury exactly what the Fairness Doctrine was.

A.   It used to be there was a law under the Federal Communications Commission that -- which regulates our airways and so on, that -- they actually were public airways, and that when important public issues were there -- mainly it was really reserved for political speech -- but that you'd have to give both sides to the story.  And so the airways, if you have one side, they'd be required to give the other side.

So in 1967, the FCC was petitioned under the Fairness Doctrine, given the important information about smoking causing disease, that for this massive amount of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=810
2179

advertising that was appearing on radio and television for cigarettes, that you'd have to have the counter story to that.  And ads ran during that period primarily provided from the American Cancer Society and the Lung Association, the Heart Association.

And they were quite effective, actually, because people for the first time were learning because they -- when they were watching television, they were just getting TV -- you know, cigarette ads.  They were finally seeing the other side of that story.  And cigarette sales began to go down and people began to quit smoking.

Q.   I apologize if I missed it.  How many cigarette ads -- I'm sorry.  How many anticigarette ads ran for every cigarette ad?

A.   It was a proportion of four cigarette ads to one antismoking ad.  So even with that ratio -- it was supposed to be one-to-one, but it didn't turn out that way.  It still had a big effect.

Q.   So if I heard you right, the effect of one antismoking ad for every four cigarette ads had an effect on reducing cigarette sales?

A.   That's right.

Q.   What would have been the effect on cigarette sales had there been a unified message beginning in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=811
2180

1953?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule that.  I believe that this witness can give that opinion.

THE WITNESS:  It's pretty clear that if there had been no controversy about whether cigarette smoking caused disease and the companies had revealed what they were talking about internally, that very few people would have taken up smoking. That means young people as well as the addictive smokers.  They would have tried a lot more to try to quit smoking.  And I think we would have avoided the diseases that we see today, frankly, from smoking. BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   And along the same line, we talked -- we talked about it as well as the defendants when they asked you questions -- talked about the amount of cigarette advertising compared to advertising or information out there in the public arena regarding the hazards of cigarette smoking.

What I'd like you to do is, I'd like to show you the 1981 FTC report.  And are you familiar with this document?

A.   Yes.  They comment on the amount of cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=812
2181

advertising versus the amount of information coming from a National Clearinghouse, which was the Surgeon General's office on smoking and health.  And, you know, basically they point out that cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product.  In 1980, it's a billion dollars a year at that point.

The National Commission on Smoking and Public Policy pointed out in 1978 that the tobacco industry spent more on advertising cigarettes in one day than the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, the government's primary agency working in this area, spent in one year.  So that sort of gives you the proportion. Cigarette advertising expenditures have grown substantially over the last decade and continue to grow. MR. CLARK:  This is PT � for the record, it's

Q.   Now, briefly, because I have it in my notes here, ZONNIC gum.  You talked about ZONNIC gum.  Does R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, this defendant, do they make ZONNIC gum?

A.   They are -- you know, they bought the company and so they are the manufacturer of ZONNIC gum.

Q.   Are they a sister company --

A.   Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=813
2182

Q.   -- within the organization? A.   Yeah.  Niconovum is the company. Q.   You were shown a lot of Reader's Digest articles, magazine articles, the Florida Health Notes, those -- a lot of documents that kind of put out the information as to -- or with the intent to show what the information was like for smokers. A.   Sure.

Q.   If the risk of cigarette smoking was fully and completely understood by all Americans, why did the industry have to engage in a 50-year-long conspiracy and create a false controversy?

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, argumentative, asked and answered, calls for speculation.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  You may proceed. THE WITNESS:  The answer is it wasn't understood by the American public.  Less than one percent of smokers in 1953 attributed cigarette smoking as a cause of cancer.  Most said it was no harm.  I think we had talked about the Roper poll in '53.  And so essentially they exploited the knowledge or lack of knowledge and the science that was growing to create a controversy and they kept it going for 45 years.

BY MR. CLARK:

Q.   Let's talk about some government -- more government reports for a second.

What is -- we talked about monographs during your first testimony on Thursday.  What is Monograph 13? When was it published?

A.   Monograph 13, I think, was published 2001. It's put out by the National Cancer Institute.  It is like a Surgeon General's report.  It's a review of the evidence.  This was looking at the lower-yield cigarette and whether, in fact, low -- light and low-yield cigarettes, in fact, were safer or were not.  And their conclusions were it was not safer.  There was no evidence at that time when you looked at it and put all the evidence together at that time that there was no benefit to switching to those products whatsoever.

Q.   And when was Monograph 13 published?

A.   I believe it was 2001.

Q.   You were asked questions about the Heaviness of Smoking Index.  Do you recall those questions?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Does Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds also use the Heaviness of Smoking Index and its own research?

A.   Yes.  Both companies rely on that index as a way of measuring somebody's nicotine dependence, the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=815
2184

strength of their nicotine dependence.  In fact, Philip Morris says it's the best validated measure of nicotine dependence in their own writings, which they put out publicly, I think, in an article in 2014.

Q.   Going back to cigarette ads for a minute.  You were asked if whether or not cigarette ads ever used the word "safer."

A.   Right.

Q.   Did cigarette ads imply they were safer?

A.   Yes.  We know from the market research that consumers perceived filters and then later filtered low tar nicotine cigarettes like lights as a safer product. That's why people went to them.

Q.   All right.  Let's turn to the Tobacco Working Group.  Talked a little about the Tobacco Working Group. Did R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris participate in the Tobacco Working Group?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Through your research of internal records regarding these two defendants, why was R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris participating in the Tobacco Working Group?

A.   They wanted to influence the direction of the group, and they did it for intelligence gathering, according to their own internal writings.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=816
2185

Q.   Have you seen documents regarding their position on whether or not they were going to share all of their knowledge with the Tobacco Working Group?

A.   Yes.  I mean, they basically acknowledged that the Tobacco Working Group, in other words, the academic scientists in the government, were going down a trail that they had been down much earlier.  And it was a dead end, basically, but they didn't stop them from doing that.

Q.   You were -- there was a couple of questions about ammonia.  Ammonia is present in bread.  And I have to ask you, are cigarettes and bread the same thing?

A.   No.  And ammonia -- you know, cigarette companies are the leading purchasers of ammonia in the world.  Of all other companies, they purchase more ammonia compounds than any other company or any other industry.

Q.   Two more questions, Dr. Cummings -- well, two more topics.

You were asked about the Great American Smokeout.  Was there something called the Great American Smokein?

A.   No.  Yes.

Q.   What was that?

A.   Well, that was a counter event that was created

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=817
2186

and marketed by the Tobacco Institute and also later by Philip Morris.  So they would use their direct mailing lists, for example, lists that they created when they'd send things to people's homes and people would sign up to get coupons and things.  And they would send them their survival kit to get through the Great American Smokeout.  They called it the Great American Smokein. Q.   Final question I have for you, Dr. Cummings.

You were asked some questions about a number of trials you've testified in, a number of case you've worked on.  Why do you testify in all these trials? A.   Well �

MR. CARTER:  Objection, Your Honor, asked and answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  He may answer. THE WITNESS:  Simple reason, I have unique knowledge that I have acquired.  And I've worked at a cancer center for 35 years.  I've seen the damage that cigarette smoking can do to people, to the families.  And so I'm here to share that voice so you hear that voice, because it needs to be heard. MR. CLARK:  Thank you.

That's all the questions I have, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have one question from

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=818
2187

the jury.  Are there any other questions that you all would like to pose to this witness?

Okay.  Counsel, do you want to approach the bench again?

(The following bench conference took place outside the hearing of the jury:)

THE COURT: I just didn't get a definitive answer from you as to whether I should ask this question.

MR. CLARK:  I have no objection to the question.

MR. CARTER:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Do you have any follow-up questions?

MR. CLARK:  No.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Judge. (End of bench conference.)

THE COURT:  How many cases do you, Dr. Cummings, pass on?

THE WITNESS:  How many do I pass on?  I have not kept track on the passes, but there are many, actually.  One, you know, because the evidence is such that I say this is not worth pursuing, because the person, based on my assessment from what I learned, unusually in a phone conversation, is not

	CLARK:
	Objection, Your
	Honor.


	THE
	COURT:
	Okay.  Is this
	a follow-up to the


	juror qu
	sstion?
	
	


	MR.
	CARTER:
	It is.  It is.
	That was just the


	transition, Your
		Honor.

THE COURT:  All right. BY MR. CARTER:

Q.   Have you ever received a request to participate in a case where the evidence was the person was a daily smoker and turned it down not because of time, but because you were unwilling to conclude that a daily smoker was addicted?

A.   Not that I'm aware of.

MR. CARTER:  Thank you, Doctor.  No further questions.

THE COURT:  Anything further from the plaintiff?

MR. CLARK:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Any other questions from the jurors?  Okay.

This witness may be excused.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.

THE COURT:  Thank you, Doctor.

(Witness excused.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take an evening recess.  We'll be starting tomorrow again at the 9:00 a.m., or as close thereto.  You all are, once again -- tired of hearing this -- but reminded of your instructions not to discuss this among yourselves, not do any

research, to listen or hear anything about this trial.  So return again between 8:30 and 8:45 downstairs to check in and then come on up here. And we'll hopefully get started right at nine o'clock tomorrow.

So thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Enjoy your evening.

(The jury excused from the courtroom at 5:11 p.m.)

THE BAILIFF:  Jurors out of the hearing of the Court, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything needs to be addressed by the Court before we adjourn?  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  No, not from us.

THE COURT:  So I'll take the bench right about a little before 9:00 and then we'll get started.  If you need me beforehand, let my bailiff know.  All right.

MR. BIGGER:  We've been here most days about 8:30 or so.  So we'll be here as usual.

MR. GEISE:  I think with the slate of witnesses tomorrow, I don't think there's a document issue that we're anticipating.

MR. BIGGER:  Just the medical records, which are into evidence.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BIGGER:  For your reference, Your Honor, tomorrow is going to be Sam Barbose, who is the brother, Dr. Drobes, who is an addiction specialist, and then Dr. Luis Villa, who is an oncologist, hematologist, medical specialist.  That's the proposed, hopefully what we'll get through.  I think based on what I understand to be the direct and cross of those witnesses, we should be able to get that accomplished tomorrow.

THE COURT:  That sounds good.

MR. GEISE:  We won't have any witness as long as Dr. Cummings for the rest of the trial.

MR. BIGGER:  One thing I will say is, we need to get Dr. Stein's designations to you.  If there's a need to play those, we need to play those.  So if there is --

MR. CARTER:  We filed our response this morning.

MR. BIGGER:  Do we have the transcript for His Honor that has the highlights on it, the objections and counter designations, all that?

MR. CARTER:  We do.

MR. BIGGER:  Can we give that to Your Honor?

THE COURT:  That would be great.

MR. BIGGER:  It's not that long.

And then I gave Bible designations, very, very, very, very, very pared down, Geoffrey Bible designations to Mr. Thorne and Mrs. Yates.

Do you guys have anything � did you guys add anything to that?

MR. THORNE:  Yes.  We'll have some objections to that, Your Honor.  In light of his pared-down version, we also need to pare down our counters.  So we'll do that.  But there's one section in there that we'll need to discuss with you.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You had me concerned when you say Bible designations.  I didn't know we were going there.

MR. BIGGER:  Not the Bible.

MR. THORNE:  Geoffrey Bible.  First Corinthians --

THE COURT:  That's right.

MR. CARTER:  Your Honor, this reflects what has been filed by both parties regarding Dr. Stein.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Is he going to be tomorrow?

MR. CARTER:  He's not going to be tomorrow. Thursday at the earliest.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll take a look at this.

All right.  We'll see you in the morning, then.
