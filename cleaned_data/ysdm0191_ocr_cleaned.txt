16   your full name for the record.

17        A.  James Neil Figlar.

18        Q.   And, Dr. Figlar, when were you first

19   advised or when were you first informed that you

20   would be giving testimony in the Weinstein case

21   that we're here to talk about today?

22        A.   Probably a few months ago when I was

23   named; but I don't know the exact date or time.

24        Q,   Was it this year, 2013?

25        A.   It may have been late last year.  I mean,

	I often am updated about what are upcoming

2
	depositions and trials that I've been named in; but

3
	I can't specifically recall.

4
	Q.   Okay.  And who's your current employer?

5
	A,   R.J. Reynolds.

6
	Q.  And who was your employer prior to

7
	R.J. Reynolds?

8
	A.  Prior to '04, you mean?

9
	Q.  Yes, sir.

10
	A.  Brown & Williamson Tobacco.

11
	Q.  Okay.  It's my understanding that you

12
	began working with Brown and Williamson in 1999.

13
	Is that right?

18
	Q.   Now, it's my understanding that

19
	testifying in these cases, in these Engle progeny

20
	cases, is something that's included within your job

21
	description or something that you do as a part of

22
	your job.  Is that right?

23
	A.   That is incorrect.

2 4
	Q.   Okay.  How is it incorrect?

25       A.   It's not part of my job description.

	the brands that R.J. Reynolds makes; and I have a     j
			

	5
	number of scientific functions that report up to
			

	6
	me, so that is my job and my job description.        f
			

	7
	Q.   Okay.  When you say that you're not paid    |
			

	8
	to do these depositions or to testify at trial, is
			

	9
	that you're not paid anything in addition to your     \
			

	10
	salary?
			

	11
	A.   That is correct.  I am not paid any        1
			

	12
	additional monies to testify.  I was asked by the
			

	13
	company if I would agree to testify for  on
			

	14
 15 16
	behalf of Reynolds, and I said I would.
		
	


		Q,   Okay.  Is your salary still at
		
	a   j


		year at current?
		
	i


	17
	A.   I mean, it has gone up with a merit
			

	18
	increase.  I think currently it should be around
			
PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED
			the  I don't know the
		

	20
	exact.  I could find that
	out.
		

	21
	Q.   Okay.  But it's slightly increased since
			

	22
	your last deposition in the Cohen case in December    1
			

	** *Jf
	2012?
			

	cL  ^z
	A.  Yes,  We were granted a merit increase
			

	25
	last year, so it's gone up I think 5 percent.

1
	Q,   Okay.  Have you given any depositions in

2
	between December 2012 and today?

3
	A.   I believe I have.  I know I've given a

Tl
	deposition in a California case, in Hughes and 

5
	two cases, Hughes and Major,  I think I also gave a

6
	deposition for an Engle progeny case in January,

7
	which may have been Haldeman.

8
	And I think previous to that I was on

9
	trial in October  September or October in the

10
	Sikes case, I think.  That's what I remember at

11
	this juncture.

12
	Q.   Okay.  What phase of the trial in Sikes

13
	did you testify in?

14
	A.   I believe it was punitive phase, so phase

15
	two.

16
	Q.   Now, with your merit pay increase, have

17
	you also nau. xio increase your sxock ownersmp in

IB
	R.J. Reynolds?

19
	A,   Well, I mean, I'm required to have at

20
	JLeasx. tn6 equivalent oi my annual salary; so, m

21
	essence, yes.

22
	Q,   Okay.  Is that what you own currently in

23
	R.J. Reynolds stock, is an amount equal to your

24
	annual salary?

25
	A.   I own a bit more than that; but close to

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=9
Page 10

1   it, yeah.  I have enough to cover any certainly 

2   well, at least kind of normal fluctuations in the

3   stock price, but yeah.  That's part of my

4   requirements as an officer, is to hold  at my

5   level as an officer to hold at least one year's

6   annual salary in stock.

7        Q.   Okay.  Does that amount of stock that

8   you're required to hold include any bonuses that

9   you may receive during the course of a year?

10        A.   It's just my  it's just my annual

11   salary.  Not any pay that -- not bonuses, just the

12   salary.

13        Q.   Okay.  Is there a reason that you don't

14   hold a significantly  is there a reason that you

15   don't hold a larger stake in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

16   Company stock?  Is there a reason that you maintain

17   your level near your annual base salary?

uL \J                                        X~i                  VV vZ* *JL JL g        JL L>       O        lw Ct Jv \Z* J- X      CX W11 J <*L. C*       L- \y       v-j \ L-       \A h-*        L** x-*       L** X J. OX w-

19   level, so it's not an insignificant sum in my mind.

20   Is there any reason I don't have more?  Well, I

21   mean, it's a lot of money as far as I'm concerned,

22   so...

3   yes; but over the last, say, three years, the stock

5   would say somewhere between 35 and $45 a share, so

6   it hasn't moved around very much.

7        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever been a part of

8   earnings conference calls for investors and things

9   like that for R.J. Reynolds?

10       A.   I've listened in; but I've not been a

12        Q.  For how long have you done that? For how

13   long have you listened in to earnings calls and

14   investor-type calls for R.J. Reynolds?

15        A.  For several years, I would say,  I guess id       since i ve oeen an oxricer, since prooaoxy  uo

17        Q.   Okay.  And during that time has the Engle

18   litigation been a subject that was discussed in any

19   of these calls?

20        A.  You know, I don't  I don't know

22   of occasions it has; but certainly it's in our 10-K

23   and annual reports and things like that.

	various times when there's questions about

20
	litigation payouts with regard to the financial

21
	position of the company.  So, I mean, it does come

22
	up; and it has been discussed.  That's my

23
	recollection as I sit here.

24
	Q.   Okay.  When was the last time you sat in

25
	on one of these calls?

1        A;  I mean, you can sit in your office and

2   dial in.  So I think  I think I was out of the

3   office during last quarter's; but I think the

4   quarter before that I remember sitting in, late in

5   the summer last year.  I think I missed the one

6   for  I think I missed the last one or two because

7   I wasn't in the office, but. I remember sitting in

8   last summer.

9        Q.  To your recollection have any of the

10   investors that have been on any of these calls

11   voiced any recommendations that they would make

12   with regard to how to handle Engle progeny

13   litigation?

14        A.   That's not what these calls are about.

15   They don't make recommendations.  They ask

16   questions, and the CFO and CEO respond to those

17   questions.

18        Q.   Okay.  It's my understanding, too, that

19   with a lot of these calls there are transcripts

20   that are maintained with the calls.  Is that your

21   understanding?

22        A.   I presume so, yes.  I believe that's

23   correct.

24        Q.   And it would be my understanding that

25   R.J. Reynolds maintains those transcripts?

8   double-check that.  I think that's how it is.

9        Q.   Okay.  It's also my understanding that               f

10   these calls are not open to the general public,                  |

11   right?

12        A.   I think they're open to shareholders.                  |

16        A.   I think so.                                                                          I

17        Q.   Now, it's my understanding that you first        |

18   began -- you first became involved in testifying in         jj

19   tobacco litigation in 2008.  Is that right?                          J

20        A.   Approximately, yes.                                                         j

21        Q.  Okay.  And just generally, what sort                   |

22   of  you know, how long did you have to prepare               f

23   yourself prior to giving your first deposition in a

24   tobacco and health case?                                                                   1

2   the last couple of times I've been deposed by your

4             But in quick summary I met with lawyers

5   over the course of about a year about once a week             f

11   over the course of about close to a year, nine                   {

12   months, before I gave my first deposition.  That's           |

13   what I recall as I sit here.

14             But, again, I think I've testified to the        \

15   amount of time that I've spent in many cases and in        I

16   many depositions in the past.

20   year-or-so period where you were preparing

21   yourself, you reviewed internal tobacco company                 j

23        A.  Not just internal documents, no; but

24   certainly internal documents, external research.               f

25   It's a fairly long history that we're talking                     f

7             Did you go out and procure all of these

8   materials that you reviewed all on your own or were

9   they provided to you?

10        A.   Some were provided and some I looked at.

19   depositions from other scientists at Reynolds; but

20   historians, no, not that I  not that I recall, I

21   have not.

22        Q.  Okay,  Have you read the depositions of

23   Dr. Borgerding?

24        A.  No, I have not.

2
	A.   I did look at -- as I sit here, I think

3
	I've read some of Dr, Townsend's depositions or

4
	trial testimonyj a ur. sentry at one point,  i nave

	I may have - I'm sorry.  I think I read

9
	Sharon Blackie's deposition at one  or trial

10
	testimony at one time and Scott Appleton as well,

11
	from the Brown & Williamson time frame.

12
	
 Q.   Did you ask for these depositions?

13
	A.   In some cases I have, yes.  As I was

14
	preparing I wanted to have an understanding of what

15
	kind of  what kind of questions specifically

16
	under cross-examination would come, the tone and

17
	tenor of that so I could have an expectation of

18
	what either a deposition would be like or a trial

19
	would be like, so I have asked for depositions.

2 0
	Q.   Okay.  So you would have reviewed these

21
	depositions  at least some of them you would have

22
	reviewed prior to ever giving a deposition of your

23
	own?

24
	A.   I may have, yes.  I really wanted to get

25  an understanding of the atmospherics, so...

3   asked of you?                                                                                        f

5        A.   No.  It helped me understand how a trial          f

6   and a deposition is conducted.  With regard to

7   substantive issues, you know, I have my own

8   opinions, my own expert and scientific background

10             So, again, I read these depositions to              |

11   get an understanding of the atmospherics, in terms          |

12   of how things are conducted, get an understanding

13   of what other experts felt the positions were or              f

14   what their positions were on issues; but I have my

7   changing on it.  But I have to agree to all the                  (j

8   documents on there and, of course, read them*                      f

9        Q,   So I take it -- you were explaining to me        j

10   that you didn't actually gather every single                        j

11   document that's on that list; some of those                          |

I

12   documents were provided to you?

13        A.   Well, certainly some of the documents on           |

14   my reliance list were the documents that I read to           |

15   prepare myself for litigation.  So some of them                 I

16   were discussed with counsel, that these might be               f

18   could agree or disagree, which I often do.                             f

19             But basically at this point the reliance           j

20   list moving forward is mostly my responsibility,                j zi       and i update it quite zrequentiy rrom reading                     I

j

23   useful and interesting that help form the basis of           j

24   my opinions.  So I update it quite frequently.                    f

25        Q,   What can you tell me about                                         j

	Irwin Weinstein?

2
	A.   I understand he was born in Brooklyn,

3
	New York, in 1926.  I believe he was in the service

4
	for a period of time; worked -- spent most of his

5
	life I believe in the Northeast in Connecticut,

6
	New Jersey; moved to Florida later in life.

7
	He started smoking I believe in nine --

8
	in the - when he was about 19 or 20 years old.  I

9
	know that he died I believe of COPD in 2005, or at

ID
	least tnat s wnat s reported*

11
	So those are the -- was married -- is

12
	married or was married, has two sons.  So really

13
	just some basic information about Mr. Weinstein.

1 A
	Q.   Is it fair to say that the only

15
	information that you have with regard to

16
	Mr. Weinstein is  essentially regard to the

17
	Weinstein family, the only information you have in

18
	that regard is contained in the complaint and

19
	interrogatories that you've reviewed?

20
	A.   I think that's fair, yes.

21
	Q.   Okay.  Have you been provided any

22
	information with regard to the Weinstein family

23
	that is not contained within those documents?

24
	A.   No, and I  no, I would not.

25       Q.   Okay.  You mentioned that Mr. Weinstein

1   did a stint in the military.

2             Do you know whether  do you know

3   whether or not he was provided cigarettes during

4   his time in the military?

5        A.   I have no idea if he was or not.

6        Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds -- during the time

7   frame when Mr. Weinstein was in the military, was

8   R.J. Reynolds providing the military with

9   cigarettes?

10             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

11        A,   I don't know.  I know today we certainly

12   sell cigarettes to the military; but I don't know

13   the history  I mean, I assume we sold cigarettes

14   to the military over time, so I would guess the

15   military would have access to cigarettes.

16   BY MR. BERG:

17        Q.  But you don't know one way  you don't

18   know one way or the other whether R.J. Reynolds

19   provided the military in the 1940s with cigarettes?

20        A.  Well, I mean  I don't know what you

21   mean by "provided."  Do you mean given away for

22   free or sold?

23        Q.   Did they sell 

24        A.  You know, I don't know  I don't have

25   any factual information or I haven't read any

15   provided to individuals in the armed services

16   during the 1940s in their rations? Are you aware             |

18             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.                    j

19        A.  Again, I don't know.  That may be true.             I

20   I'm not disputing it; I just don't  I'm not an               \

25  certainly the possibility exists of
	
United Reporting, Inc.

1   health-associated outcomes with regard to smoking.

2             So the operating premise was if you can

3   reduce things that might be associated with that,

4   it would be a good idea.  And certainly Reynolds'

5   track record with regard to altering products to

6   accomplish that I think is fairly clear throughout

7   history.                                                 v

8             So I think you can see  certainly in

jl\j       issues were discussed, actively researcned, and

11   design changes made to product in accordance with

12   that idea.

16   smoking in the mid to late 1950s?

17        A.   Not necessarily.  What I said was, and I

18   think what is clear, is that Reynolds certainly

19   recognized that there was an association.  The

20   epidemiology at that point was coming out starting

2
	were toxicants in product and try to do a number of

3
	things to try to reduce the concentrations of those

4
	compounds in smoke.

5
	Q.   So the reason that R.J. Reynolds first

6
	began developing reduced risk products was to

7
	reduce the associated risk of developing a chronic

8
	disease from smoking?

9
	A.  Well, again, I think Reynolds recognized

10
	that there was a potential association and felt it

11
	was certainly the right thing to do, to understand

12
	what is in smoke, identify what types of things are

13
	in smoke.  If they were potentially toxicants,

14
	certainly engage in pr0grams ^o try to reduce those

15
	things in smoke.

16
	So certainly recognized that there was a

17
	potential of negative public health outcomes with

18
	regard to smoking and attempted to change their

	were they a concern of the Public Health community

1   R.J, Reynolds Tobacco Company?

2        A,   Well, I would say you certainly can make

3   that argument considering what Reynolds did in

4   terms of investing in 'research and development to

5   trying to (a) understand if they were there, and

6   then (b) try to understand ways in which one could

7   reduce them either in tobacco or smoke.  So I would

8   say there certainly was an interest there.

9        Q.   Okay.  Now, did R.J. Reynolds develop its

10   research and development program or its R&D

11   department in 1951, 1952 time frame?

12        A.   Yes.  That is the correct time frame.

13        Q.   What was the purpose of developing that

14   division?

15        A.   Really, I think you can certainly say

16   that, you know, science had been conducted at

17   Reynolds prior to that.  You know, certainly

18   there's patent literature around cigarettes and

19   patents by Reynolds, so there was certainly

22             But I think R&D's development was really

23   to get a much broader and deeper understanding of

24   the scientific issues around tobacco and cigarette

25   smoke in particular based on the culmination of

11        A.  With regard to the information, no.  I               I

12   think there was certainly questions about the                      |

13   information in the 1950s.  Certainly Reynolds would        |

14   have questioned information just like many in the             |

15   Public Health community questioned, for instance,             f

16   the power of statistics to prove cause and effect.

17   Certainly those issues were debated openly in the             ||

19   National Cancer Institute, and other Public Health          I

I

1       A.   I think the statistics were recognized,

3       think Reynolds has certainly been aware of the

5   and again, like I said, research was conducted

6   around individual issues with regard to smoking and

7   public health ~- questions of public health.

8             For instance, in the 1950s  with the

9   mouse skin painting results coming out in the early

10   1950s, there was a great deal of discussion around

11   what would drive that, what would be in smoke that

12   would drive those mouse skin painting results; and

13   many were pointing to benzo(a)pyrene.  So a great

14   deal of work was done around trying to find

15   benzo(a)pyrene in cigarette smoke of Reynolds'

16   products and really try to research that issue.

17             So those are the kinds of things that

18   were done.  So if that's not recognition of what

19   the Public Health community was talking about with

20   regard to smoking and health, just off the top of

21   my head I can't think of  there are many more

22   examples.  There's phenols later in the '50s.  I

23   mean, I can go on and on for a long period of time,

24   but that's the kind of work that was done and the

25   kind of things that were done in the 1950s.

1   responsible for the mouse skin painting results,

4             It's not been  there has never been a

5   magic bullet so to speak found in cigarette smoke

6   that can account for a lot of the potential public

7   outcomes.  And certainly that was what was being

8   discovered in the 1950s.  The Public Health

9   community and the scientific community thought,

10   "Oh, there's benzo(a)pyrene in smoke.  Clearly,

11   that must be the culprit in terms of what's driving

12   the mouse skin painting results." Well, it was

13   found out later, no, there wasn't enough there.

15   painting results came about, which was -- and I

16   think Wynder made the suggestion in the late 1950s

17   that maybe there are other things in smoke, like

18   phenols, that are acting like co-carcinogens and

19   then the benzo(a)pyrene works as a promoter once

20   the co-carcinogen starts, initiates.

21             So a number  I guess my point is it's a

22   much more complicated situation than saying, "Oh,

23   there's a carcinogen in smoke and therefore one

24   must now know this will cause tumors on the backs

25   of mice."  It's never that simple; and it's a much

8   benzopyrene considered to be a carcinogen?                           f

10   was, you know, an agency that was labeling                           j

13   believe it was considered to be carcinogenic in the        J

14   1950s.  I'm pretty sure of that because it was                   f

1        A.   You know, I don't know off the top of my

3   course that number and the number of things in

5   in smoke have increased over time.

14   those publications.

15             Of course, today that number is larger

16   because analytical techniques are much better and

17   have been improved; but I think that's probably a

18   fairly close number in the 1950s.

19        Q.   Okay.  What does it mean to be

20   carcinogenic?

21        A.   Well, I think specifically it means it

22   would cause cancer in an animal or human if one is

23   exposed to that compound, that pure compound, at a

24   particular concentration over a period of time.  So

25   I think that's, in essence, what it means.  It's

5        Q.   Okay.  So these 10 to 12 compounds that

6   were known to be carcinogenic in the 1950s that

7   were contained within smoke, those compounds had

8   the potential to cause cancer and that was known in

9   the 1950s, right?

10        A.   I think some were.  And, again, the

11   question is, or was at the time, are they present

12   in tobacco smoke in concentrations sufficient

13   enough to cause that? And I think that's  that's

14   kind of been the struggle.  We talked about

15   benzopyrene earlier.  And when you look at the

16   mouse skin painting results and then you look at

17   the concentrations of benzopyrene in smoke, even

18   Dr. Wynder had to say "There's really not enough

19   there to cause that result."  Even though

20   benzopyrene was known to be a carcinogen, it wasn't

21   there in sufficient quantities to render that

23             Of course, human beings are exposed to

1       Just because a carcinogen is present does not

<       necessarily mean tnat we as an organism are going

3   to contract cancer.  We have a lot of WOnderful

4   things going on in our body to help fight toxins in

5   our body.  So that's ultimately the question with

6   regard to cigarette smoke, is concentration of the

7   toxicant or carcinogen and time.

8        Q.   Are carcinogens, are they toxic

9   substances?

10        A.  Some can be, I presume.  I presume they

11   can be both toxic as well as carcinogens.  Not all

12   are, I would say, but some.

13        Q.   Is benzopyrene a toxic substance?

14        A.  You know, I think it's a carcinogen.  I

15   don't know that I would say that it's toxic,  I

16   suppose anything in proper concentration would be

17   toxic, so it's kind of a loose definition.

18        Q.  Okay.  Now, as a result of Reynolds'

19   recognition of these carcinogenic compounds

20   contained in tobacco smoke, did Reynolds engage in

21   a plan or behavior to try and reduce the harm that

22   could potentially be caused by those substances?

23             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

24        A,   I believe in general I told you that

25   that's been kind of like the operating premise

1   since the 1950s.  So my answer to that question is

2   yes.  Specific examples would be, for instance,

3   filtration.  Filters actually work, they reduce not

4   only tar and nicotine, but everything that comes

5   along in the tar, including things like benzopyrene o       lor instance.

7             So to specifically answer your question,

8   yes.  If you look at my disclosure, I can go

y       r-nrougn a wnoxe litany on tnings tnati Keynoicis ciio*

10   to deal with that.  I'm sure you've seen my trial

12   I'll leave that up to you whether you want me to

13   rehash all that or not through further questioning.

16   I'm just going to try to nitpick a couple things.

17        A.   That's fair.

18        Q.   Is there any carcinogenic substance or

19   compound that Reynolds has been successful in

20   removing from tobacco smoke over time completely?

21        A.   Completely, no.  Partially, yes, on a

22   number of fronts.  We can certainly talk about many z<5       or "cne unings t. n a "t are in tar nave oeen reouceci,

25       been reduced to smokers over time.

1             Another good example I think would be

2   tobacco-specific nitrosamines, which are

3   carcinogens; that certainly Reynolds has helped t        vii. i v c q.x "clu CLion in jl o iNr* yiciQb over x. line   oo^

5   yeah, there's a number of compounds I would say

6   we've been successful in reducing.  I can't say

7   that we've been successful in the complete

8   elimination, specifically of combustible-generated

9   toxicants and carcinogens.

10        Q.  Okay.  You mentioned filters.

11             Are filters used as a method of general

12   reduction or specific reduction?

13        A.   They can be both.  But, in essence,

14   they're  I think they're best for general

15   reduction.  As it turns out, they are good for

16   selective reduction as well.  Specifically, the

17   hardening agent that we use to stiffen the filter

iX- O                                                                               Cl v** C* vX O- !_ J- Y      O v* JL \Z \^ L* JL v \ JL V      JL vZI* v-X. LX v^ vZ- O       r^1^ ^ ** * X *' JL O /        *I* XIV V^ JL V V VA      W *X- L X X

19   phenols.  So it can be both.

20        Q.   Okay.  What sort of reduction techniques

21   has Reynolds used to reduce the risk associated

22   with unfiltered cigarettes?

23        A.   Well, really all of the ones that are

24   available from  at least from my perspective  I

25   can go through the list  would be reconstituted

12   think of as I sit here.

13        Q.   Okay.  And you mentioned that each of

14   those items, each of those things  reconstituted

15   tobacco, expanded tobacco, high-porosity paper, and

16   use of stems  those are all methods by which to

17   reduce the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes?

18        A.   They do, yes.

19        Q.   Is a cigarette with a reduced amount of

20   tar and nicotine any safer than a regular cigarette

21   with a regular  with a normal  you know, a

23        A,  Well, I think the epidemiology on that

24   issue is fairly clear.  When comparing people who

25   used unfiltered cigarettes from the 1920s, '30s,

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

CDpgNbr=44
Page 45 |

1   ' 40s compared to those who switched to filtered

2   cigarettes, I think the epidemiology is pretty

3   clear, showing a dose-response relationship and a

4   reduction of risk between filtered and unfiltered

D         uxy wl c I- t CO 

6             So I think the toxicological premise is

7   at play.  If one can reduce the yield of tar and

8   nicotine, specifically tar, there should be, and I

9   think is, a reduction in risk.  So long story 10       short, my answer is yes.

19        Q.   Fair enough.

20        A.   Combustible products.  Yes, in general,

21   the same types of compounds are present in higher

22   yielding versus lower yielding.  It's a matter of

23   the concentration or the amount of those toxicants

24   that is reduced.

10
	there's a number of cancers and other health

11

11   You would be literally exposed to it.

12        Q.   Are individuals who are exposed to

13   secondhand smoke exposed to the same carcinogens?

14        A.   Potentially, yes.  Potentially.

15        Q.   Now, you qualify that with "potentially."

16             In what circumstances would an individual

17   exposed to secondhand smoke not be exposed to the

18   same carcinogens?

19        A.   I just don't know the literature that

20   well on secondhand smoke, so I always try to be

21   scientific in my answers.  If I don't specifically

22   know the science around an issue, I'm not going to

23   speculate.  I haven't made a study of secondhand

24   smoke thoroughly, so I'm hesitant to comment too

6   point, of the 1964 Surgeon General's report on

7   smoking and health?

B                             MR, KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9      A.   I think what the '64 Surgeon General's

10   report  do you mean the headline or what I think

11   the '64 Surgeon General's report did?  I'm sorry to

12   answer a question with a question, but...

14        Q.   I'll clarify.  First give me what the

15   headline was.

16        A.   I think the headline was that cigarette i /       smoKmg   neavy cigarette   i.  m trying to

18   remember the exact.  "Cigarette smoking causes

19   cancer in heavy male smokers" was the biggest

20   headline, I think, out of that report, if you read

21   the report.

22        Q.   Okay.  At the time when the report came

23   out in 1964, did R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

24   agree with the message being conveyed by the

1             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

2        A,  It really depends on what specifics

3   you're talking about with regard to the report.

4             With regard to the issue around whether

5   or not there was enough evidence to declare

6   causation, I would think it's fair to say that

8   scientific evidence to make a cause-and-effeet

9   relationship at that time.

10             But certainly there were many areas in

11   the report that I think Reynolds would have felt

12   were accurate and certainly had no issues with.

13             Certainly the '64 Surgeon General's

14   report used a bunch of information that Reynolds

15   published.  So I think that one set of  in terms

11   BY MR. BERG:

12        Q.  Absolutely.

13             Do you have any reason to dispute that

14   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company put out statements to

15   the American public around the time the Surgeon

16   General's report came out that it disagreed with

18             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

19        A.   You know, I don't know how to

20   characterize that.  I think what Reynolds' position l       was is tnai: Lney aian z  ceneve tnere was enougn

22   scientific information to make a cause-and-effect

23   statement.  So I think that is what Reynolds' -- I

24   know that's what Reynolds' position was at that

25   time.  I think there were probably statements made

5   statements put out by Reynolds to the effect that

6   they disagreed that there was a cause-and-effect

8   cancer?

9             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10        A.  Again, I don't know  specifically from

11   Reynolds? That, I don't know.  You know, I know

12   what Reynolds' position was at that time.  Whether

13   or not it was widely disseminated to the public or

14   not, that part I'm not exactly sure of in terms of

15   what specifically  what documents or what are

16   you saying with regard to what Reynolds said.  I

17   know what their position was; I just don't know how

19   statements were made; I just don't know how often.

10   already.  But yeah, absolutely.

11        Q.   Okay.  So what was Reynolds' response 

12   not their position, but what was their response to

13   the Public Health concern that was evident as

14   published in the 1964 Surgeon General's report?

15        A.   I think it's pretty clear that Reynolds'

16   response  and certainly what I mean by the

17   response is what did Reynolds do with its

18   portfolio?  Clearly, Reynolds continued efforts to

19   reduce tar and nicotine yields with its products.

20   Reynolds made scientific study of a whole number of

21   issues and prevailing Public Health concerns with

22   regard to cigarette smoking and public health.

23             For instance, after '64, since we're

24   talking about '64, there was a theory that

25   cigarette smoking and the associations of health

1   concerns with cigarette smoking might have

2   something to do with ciliostasis.  In other words,

3   the cilia being deactivated in your lung, which

4   helps move things in and out of your lung.

5   Reynolds studied that.  Reynolds put out products

6   that potentially reduced those effects, by

7   investigating and putting out a brand of cigarette

8   with a charcoal filter, which" helps to reduce the

9   effects to the cilia.

10             So that's what I mean by "responses," is

11   really what did Reynolds do from a scientific

12   perspective in studying the issues that were of

19   those findings public?  Did it tell the American

20   public that it had found these 10 or 12

21   carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke?

22        A.   Well, I wouldn't say Reynolds found them.

23   They confirmed that they were there.  They had been

24   found and reported on in the scientific literature

25   years prior to that.  So this was not  it wasn't

1   really a discovery; it was already known.  But

2   certainly Reynolds confirmed the presence of those

3   compounds in the cigarette smoke of their

4   cigarettes.  And, of course, what Reynolds did was

5   look at ways to try to reduce those.  That's what

6   actions they took with regard to that.

7        Q.   Did Reynolds inform the American public

8   that it confirmed the presence of 10 to 12

9   carcinogenic compounds within tobacco smoke in the

10   1950s?

11        A.   I don't know whether they would have or

12   not.  I mean, this was widely  this was a widely

13   known thing in the 1950s.  I mean, certainly

14   Reader's Digest reported on that issue throughout

15   that whole decade, so I'm not sure really quite

16   what you mean.

17             I don't recall that Reynolds put out a

18   publication with regard to -- I don't think

19   Reynolds put out a publication confirming that what

20   had already been known and found in the scientific zi       literature was m tact true.

7        Q.   So if R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company had

8   knowledge of a health risk associated with one of

9   its products, you would expect that it should

10   inform the consumers of using that product of that

11   potential health risk, right?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form,

13        A.   I don't know if that's necessarily

14   Reynolds' role.  I think Reynolds has a right to be

15   clear about what its position is on various issues

16   with regard to its product, and I think it has

17   been,

18             Certainly Reynolds' position with regard

19   to smoking and health has evolved over time, and I

20   think that's fairly clear with regard to the public

8        Q.  Okay.  I understand that Reynolds was

9   aware of the epidemiological studies and the

10   statistical studies performed in the 1950s, but did   j

11   Reynolds affirmatively disagree with the results of   j

12   any of those studies?                                                                       I

13        A.   I don't know if they did or not.  I'm not   |

14   aware of any documentation that would suggest that

15   Reynolds said that the studies that were published    f

16   were not scientifically accurate.  I think what                j

17   Reynolds would have  Reynolds' position in the              j

18   '50s would have been that statistical information            |

23             So that would be what I would be aware of

1        Q.   Okay.  I'm sure you would agree with me

11        A.   That I'm aware of? No.  There are

13   that they're considered drugs or considered to be

14   addictive.

21        A,   To my knowledge that would be the  that

22   would be the current understanding, yes.  It's not

23   that that's always been the case.  But the current

24   understanding is nicotine is considered to be

25   addictive, R.J. Reynolds agrees with that

1   characterization, and that is the only thing that

2   I'm aware of that would be considered to be

3   addictive in cigarettes.

4        Q.  Okay,  So worded in another way, nicotine

5   is the drug that causes cigarettes to be addictive?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7        A.   In general I would agree, that would be

8   correct.

9   BY MR. BERG:

10        Q.   Okay.  You would agree that every

11   cigarette manufactured by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

12   Company or one of its subsidiaries or companies

13   that have merged with it over the years, you would

14   agree that every cigarette that Irwin Weinstein

15   smoked manufactured by one of those companies

16   contained nicotine, right?

17        A.   I would -- I mean, I don't know

18   everything that Irwin Weinstein smoked; but if it

19   was a tobacco product, yes, it would have contained

20   nicotine.

21        Q.   Okay.  And then for every cigarette that

22   he smoked that contained nicotine was addictive?

24   really depends on what time frame you're talking

25   about.  But today we would consider it to be

1   addictive, yes.

2        Q.   Okay.  What's your definition of

3   "addicted" or "addictive"?

4        A.   Well, I'm not a pharmacologist, so mine I

5   guess would be considered a scientific opinion, but

7             I would say that something by today's

8   standards would be considered to be addictive if

9   there's  something that might be difficult to

10       stop doing could be considered to be addictive.  I

ii       certainly iiKe some oi tne cnaracterizations tnat

12       the '64 Surgeon General's report pointed out with

1.3       regard to that issue.

14             So I guess my definition of addiction

15   straddles between some of the things that

16   pharmacologically one would say from a scientific

17   standpoint, but also what a layperson on the street

18   would consider to be addiction.

19        Q.  Okay.  So correct me if I'm wrong, but

20   your definition of addiction is something is

21   addictive if it's difficult to stop?

22        A.   I think that's probably one of the

23   potential criteria.  That's my personal  I'm

24   assuming you're asking my personal opinion.

2   scientific opinion on that.

3        Q.   Right.  I'm just asking your personal

4   opinion at this very moment.  And your opinion is

5   that something's addictive if it's difficult to

8   would consider, yes; but that's not to say

9   that there are other things that are probably part

10   of that.  That doesn't mean that  you know,

11   somebody might quit smoking, for instance, very

12   easily, but may have been addicted.  So it's not an

13   all-encompassing kind of criteria.

14        Q.   I'm just asking for your opinion here.

15   So if there's other criteria that go with your

16   opinion of what addiction means, please tell me.

17        A.   I don't know.  I haven't really thought

18   about coming up with my own definition of

19   addiction.  I think I can comment on others, you

20   know, what others have said about that topic.  I

21   guess you've asked me a question that I haven't

22   really thought about, in terms of what are my

23   definitions of addiction.

24             I think part of it would be a difficulty

25   in quitting.  I think certainly something wouldn't

1   be addictive if somebody didn't like doing it.  So

2   there has to be something I think that people

3   derive some perceived benefit from in order for it

4   to be addicting.

5             You know, I think if I reflect back on

6   certainly what the '64 Surgeon General would say,

7   there's pharmacological or physiological effects

8   when talking about drugs of either addiction or

9   habituation.  Certainly that  there's a component

10   of that to addiction.

11             Again, I guess you kind of put me on the

12   spot.  I hadn't really thought about defining

13   addiction for myself in some time.  Those are some

14   of the things I would think of as I sit here.

15        Q.   Okay.  So thinking about it right now,

16   the criteria for your own personal definition of

17   addiction that you've given me is one, it's

18   difficult to stop; and two, it is a perceived 1.9       benefit.

/Li KJ                                                                                                 /* X-  v>        L^ J. i, \^* Jl* v^       Ca, X X Y        Vx Km" X X \ms X        Vw JL  JL Vw G JL  JL CI        k+ X X C* k**        y  \y v4.

21   utilize for your own definition of addiction?

22        A.   I think I said also there's likely to be

23   some physiological or pharmacological reaction to a

24   substance that would make it addictive.  I think,

25   you know, again, if you think back to the '64

^IT!8!?!??!??!^?!?^^

United Reporting, Inc.pgNbr=66

1   Surgeon General's report, I mean, they're talking

2   about intoxication as being an aspect of addiction,

3   which I think in the case of nicotine you don't

4   really  you don't really get that.

5             But those are some of the things I would

6   reflect on as I sit here.

7        Q.  Okay.  Now you've given me three

8   criteria.  Are there any others besides it's

9   difficult to stop, there's a perceived benefit, and

10   it's likely to cause physiological or

11   pharmacological changes or behavioral changes or

12   some sort of change in that regard?

15   criteria that you're including in your definition?

16        A.   Again, as I sit here  you kind of put

17   me on the spot  I haven't really thought about

18   it.  As a scientist, I would want to go back and

19   reflect on defining what my definition of addiction

20   would be.

21             So as I sit here, those are the things

22   that I think of.  That doesn't mean that I won't go

1   what I came up with.

2        Q.   Okay.  So those are kind of the criteria

3   that you would use.

4             And then you mentioned that there's a

5   scientific definition of addiction that you u       suDscriue to,

i                  /\   iean.  Again, i rninx   wen, j. tninK

8       I believe I've testified to this before in I think

.9       the last deposition, perhaps with your firm.

10             When you look at the major definitions

11   from the Surgeon General from 1964 and from 1988, I

12   believe there are aspects for me personally of both

13   Of those definitions that I agree with.  So, I

14   meanf i would reflect on what those two documents

15   talk about that I would both agree and, you know,

16   potentially disagree with aspects of both.

17             So I think it's fair to say that when I

18   think about addiction, I think about nicotine

19   addiction.  I think about those definitions that

20   were used in those two time frames.

21        Q.   So what you're telling me is you haven't

22   formulated your own definitive definition of

23   addiction?

24        A.   I haven't really.  I mean, I haven't

25   really thought about it in those terms of whether

'"BnWraWfflWMWW&tiWM'M^

1   or not I should or have to.

2             With regard to nicotine and nicotine in

3   cigarettes, I agree that it's addictive, certainly

4   by today's standards.  But when I reflect back and

14   deeply, and I agree with much of what was in '64.

15             But there's aspects of '88 that I agree

16   with as well.  So that's kind of what I think about

17   when I think about this issue.

18        Q.  What definition of addiction does

19   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company subscribe to?

20        A.   I think we're pretty clear.  We state

22   addictive, but that nicotine hasn't been shown to

23   have any significant health effects in and of

24   itself.  So I think that is what their position is.

25   I think that's fairly clear and unambiguous.

5   mean, nicotine  as we talked about earlier,

6   nicotine, along with a lot of other things, at

7   sufficient concentration can be a toxicant, for

8   sure.  But as nicotine is found in tobacco and in

9   tobacco products, no,

10        Q.   Why does R.J. Reynolds find it necessary

11   to produce products with lower nicotine yields?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   We don't really.  When I've talked about

14   producing products with lower tar and nicotine,

15   Reynolds has done that.  The reason why you get

16   lower tar and nicotine is because when one reduces

17   tar, nicotine  whatever you've done to reduce

22   that suggestions have been made that nicotine

23   should also be lowered.  So by reducing tar, you're

24   also reducing nicotine.  So it comes right along

25   with it.

	Q.  So other than the coincidence that when

7
	nicotine, lower amounts of nicotine?

8
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9

13
	perspective.  So, yeah, I mean, there's reasons to

14
	try to certainly pay attention to the nicotine

15
	yields of your product.

16
	For instance, I'm sure you understand

17
	that tobacco is an agricultural crop; it is

18
	affected by agricultural practices, environment,

19
	et cetera.  So in particular, in draught years

20
	tobacco nicotine levels actually go quite high; and

21
	one has to obviously be careful of that if one

22
	wants to make a consistent cigarette product.  You

^23
	don't want wild fluctuations in the quality of your

24
	tobacco leaf.

25
	And nicotine being fairly specific to

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

CDpgNbr=74
Page 75

1   tobacco is a key indicator in leaf quality.  So we

2   do certainly pay attention to the nicotine yields

3   of the crop and how we put product together to try

4   to make a consistent product.

*J               G^ X l -l,L\  j JCj \ w *

6        Q.   Okay.  So maybe I'm wrong here.  You can

7   correct me if I'm wrong,

8             Is it fair to say that the higher the

9   nicotine yield in the tobacco plant itself, the

10   lower quality of the leaf?

11        A,   Not necessarily lower quality.  It can

JL L*                        Jw' Vw*  *                  A-*-' Li \*r       W X X CX Krr       JL       All      O L-A V-4 VJ \^ O L* JL X I V--J       JL <0      X 4 JL v** \J \^, JL 4, Jt \       J, J, CX O       CX A A

13   effect certainly on the quality of the smoke.  It

14   can be an indicator of leaf quality as well.

15             What I'm suggesting is that consumers,

16   and certainly smokers, would notice if the nicotine

17   portion of their cigarette changed wildly from one

18   day to the next.  That would be noticeable.  I

19   mean, it has a sensory effect when one smokes.

20             So what Reynolds tries to do, and I think

21   what most people in the industry try to do, is make

22   a consistent product.  So that's why certainly

23   nicotine is important for us to pay attention to.

24   Certainly from a quality and consistency

25   standpoint, it's an important part of that.

1        Q.   Okay.  Now, you mentioned that in drought

2   years, for instance, you could be presented with

3   crops of tobacco plants that have drastically high

5   correct?

6        A,  Yes.  That happens.

7        Q.   How does R.J. Reynolds  how does

8   Reynolds go about ensuring that they produce a

9   consistent product to sell to the American public?

10        A.  That's a very good question.

11             What we do is we deal with crop variation

12   by basically blending technology.  I say "blending"

13   in terms of where we procure our tobacco leaf.  So

14   you have a  we buy tobacco in Eastern

15   North Carolina, South Carolina, Western North

16   Carolina, Georgia, Florida, in the United States;

17   and then we buy tobacco across the globe, mostly

18   Brazil; but places in Africa as well; Turkey,

i- 0?                    G L*    \-W %-* L*" V-* J   d *

20             So it's through the blending of many

21   different crops from a global spread is a way you

22   can try to ensure consistency.  So if the eastern

23   belt in North Carolina has a really, really dry

24   year and the nicotine yields are very high, what

25   you would try to do is deal with that bad crop year

5   you're going to have a bad crop year.  So you blend

6   over the course of multiple crop years; and then a

7   large regional, if not a global, distribution of

8   your tobacco supply to help make a consistent

9   product,

10             I hope that answers your question.

11        Q.  Why is it necessary to have a consistent

12   product as far as cigarettes go?

13        A.   Why? Because that's what consumer

14   expectations are.  It's no different than you going

15   down the street and buying your Tropicana orange

16   juice or whatever brand of orange juice you drink.

17   You have an expectation that that orange juice is

18   going to taste the same every time you buy it.

19             It's the same reason why McDonald's makes

20   a Big Mac the same way.  And you can go to a

21   McDonald's in New York City or California or

22   Florida or wherever and have the expectation that

23   that Big Mac is going to taste the same as anywhere

24   else.

25             There's an expectation that people who

1   smoke Winston are going to be able to buy a pack of

2   Winston in North Carolina that's going to taste the

3   same as if they bought it in North Dakota.

4             So that's why we do it; that's what

5   consumer expectations are.  We pay attention to

6   what our consumers want.

7        Q.   Now, in addition to blending tobacco leaf

8   from various crops  or crop years, I take it

9   even, right?

10        A,   We do, yeah.

11        Q.   In addition to blending the leaf, you

12   also  R.J. Reynolds also has additives that they

13   add into cigarettes, right?

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go

15   ahead.

16        A.   We do use additives, yes, depending on

15        A.   It depends.  It depends on what it is.

16   But I think it's fair to say that the top dressings

17   that one would use serves the purpose of

18   differentiating our brands from other brands in the

19   marketplace and also are looked at and developed

20   with the intent of marrying well with tobacco

21   smoke.  That is how our flavor guys develop top

22   dressings, is with that in mind.

23        Q.   Now, when  let me ask this.

24             Do some of these additives include corn

25        syrup?

1          A.   They can, yes.

2          Q.   Is cocoa and coffee grounds, coffee-bean

3    grounds, are those additives as well?

4          A.  Coffee-bean grounds, that I don't believe

5    so.

.6                                  Is cocoa used? Yes.  Cocoa has been

7    traditionally been used.  High fructose corn syrup

8    is used, which is of course a sugar; and as you are

9    I'm sure aware, tobacco contains sugar naturally. 10                                  So when I answered your question earlier, ijl        are tney naturally in tooacco, actually, a lot or

12    things are; and a lot of things are produced when

13    tobacco is burned.  I mean, there's over -- well

14    over 5000 individual chemical compounds in

15    cigarette smoke.

16                So a lot of the things that we would use

20          Q.   Does burning any of these additives that

21    are mixed in with the cigarettes, does the burning

22    of any of these additives give off carcinogenic

23    compounds?

24          A.   Possibly.  But I think when you evaluate

25    and look at the evaluation of the additives that we

1   use in our tobacco products, based on the levels

2   that we use them on they do not increase the

3   inherent risks associated with smoking.  They have

4   been evaluated from that perspective, and certainly

6   these issues in the past.

7             So no, it doesn't -- the additives we use

8   do not, I would say, increase the burden with

9   regard to the relative risk of smoking,

10        Q.   Okay.  Have you ever or has R.J. Reynolds

12   determine what additional carcinogens are being

It       dressings or au.ctir.ives ;

15             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

16        A.  Again, that's what I think I just said,

17   we do.  We have a stewardship program that

18   evaluates additives.  We've actually published

19   toxicological assessments of additives that we use

20   in our products.

21             So the answer to our question is yes, we

22   have made those evaluations from a toxicological

23   basis.

7        A.   Again, I think that information is known;

9   toxicological assessment of what that burden would

10   be from an inherent risk standpoint.  That has been

20   Reynolds' position is on additives.  I think it's

21   also pretty clear that Reynolds for many years has

22   disclosed what its additives are, both to the

23   federal government through HHS and certainly

24   through FDA today, in terms of what additives we

25   use for our product.

7        Q,   Okay,  I'm just curious about whether

8   R.J. Reynolds is aware of or not whether any of

10   when burned.  That's all I'm curious about.

11        A.   I think some can.  But, again, the

12   question is not whether or not something will

13   generate a carcinogen.  It goes back to what is the

14   dose and how much from a concentration standpoint

15   would be generated back to the point of you're

16   exposed to carcinogens every day.

17             Does it increase the burden? Does it

18   increase the inherent risk?  Those questions have

19   been asked specifically about the things that

20   Reynolds puts into its product as well as

21   generating scientific data around those additives

2        Q.   Is it fair to say that exposure to a

3   carcinogenic compound in any dose level, at any

4   dose level, to some extent increases one's risk of

5   developing disease or it increases their health

6   risk?

7        A,   I don't know that you can say that

8   actually.  If that were the case, then I think

9   everything that humans do would be increasing your

10   health risk.  I mean, we literally have immune

11   systems and we have clearance systems in our bodies

12   that deal with what are known as toxic insults to

13   your body, so I don't think that that's fair.

14             If that were the case, I don't think

15   humans would be  have evolved to this point. We

16   would have been knocked out long ago if we didn't

17   have response mechanisms in our body to deal with

14        A.  Yes.

15        Q.   Okay.  Why is that?

16        A.   Well, because I think it's very clear

1   should be very, very clear about what those

5   relative risk of smoking exactly to that as using

6   smokeless.

7             So there is no incentive whatsoever for a

8   smoker to go ahead and try a smokeless product

9   because the Public Health community has not in my

10   opinion properly educated the population out there

11   to know what those relative risk differences are.

12             And those differences are extreme and

13   very, very large; and I think it is, in my opinion,

	there that I really have  I really don't

2
	understand it, and I don't agree with it; and I      \

3
	think it's something that should be corrected for

4
	the sake of public health.

5
	Q.   Is it your personal opinion that Snus is    \

:* 6
	nearly perfectly safe?

7
	A.   I think there's probably some risk

8
	associated with it.  But from a relative

9
	perspective, if I compare it to cigarette smoking,

10
	practically so.  We believe in at Reynolds  and

11
	our scientists believe in and I believe in  a

12
	continuum of risk, in terms of what the profile is

13
	for a whole number of tobacco products and

14
	nicotine-containing products.  And I would argue,

15
	ano. nave, t-fiuL cert-amiy prooucts iiKe onus are

16
	very low on the risk continuum.  I won't say that

17
	there is no risk; but I think they're very, very

18
	low.

19
	Q.   Snus is an addictive product, right?

20
	a.   il wouJ.Q oe  in. contains nicot-ine, so ir.

21
	would be considered to be addictive, yes.

22
	Q.   I think you've acknowledged there's some

23
	elevated risk of oral cancer with Snus?

24
	A.   With Snus?  I don't know about that.  I

25  think my recollection of the Swedish data is that

5   enough U.S. data on U.S. Snus, although it's

6   exactly the same as the Swedish Snus; but the best

7   data that's available is from Sweden.  So I would

11             I don't have it memorized off the top of

12   my head, if you understand my meaning there.

13        Q.   Smokeless tobacco, Snus, for instance, I

14   mean, I know you agree that it's addictive; but

15   it's no less addictive than a cigarette, is it?

16        A.   I don't know.  I don't think you can

17   measure that.  I mean, addiction is  look,

18   addiction is measured by the person.  You can't

19   look at a product and say this product is more

20   addictive than that product.  That's not how zJ.         actcucuion is evaiuateo.

22             There is no, again, magic test that one

23   can look at a product and say or make relative

24   comparisons on addiction or addictiveness.  That is

25   measured by the person.  Does that make sense?

	or cocaine; you're just not aware of that or not,

	I don't agree  I wouldn't agree with

22
	the characterization that nicotine in cigarettes is

23
	the same as drugs of abuse like heroin and cocaine.

	I would not put them in the same camp.

3   individuals using those products, if I understand

4   your position?

5        A.   I would say in general, that's correct.

6   I think the way that people assume or presume

13   is evaluated.

14        Q.   Now, you would agree with me that many,

15   many smokers become addicted to the nicotine in the

16   cigarettes, right?

17             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

20   BY MR. BERG:

21        Q.   Okay.  You would agree with me that for

22   individuals who are addicted to smoking cigarettes,

23   who are addicted to cigarettes, that it can be

24   extremely difficult to quit?

25        A.   I would suppose so.  I mean, I think it

.....S^SJBBjBjjjSBSBJBBffl^^^^

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=94
Page 95

1   can be very difficult for people to quit who might

2   not be addicted.  I think it's really dependent on

3   the individual.  I think there are lots of addicted

4   smokers out there who find it very difficult to

5   quit and many addicted smokers out there who don't

6   find it difficult to quit.  So...

10             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

11        A.   I don't know about that.

12             In fact, you know, I've read some recent

13   studies where nicotine containing  whether it's

14   an NRT~type product is put up against somebody

16   actually the craving relief from a denicotinized

17   cigarette was better than the nicotine-containing

18   therapy.

19             So I don't know.  I think it's a

20   complicated situation.  Nicotine is certainly

21   considered to be addictive, and I would not negate

22   its importance in terms of that; but it's not as

23   simple as saying, "Oh, yeah, it's all about the

24   nicotine."  It's not that simple.

25        Q.   You would agree with me that even

1       denicotinized cigarettes contain some level of

3        A.   Some can.  Very, very low; but yes,

4   possibly.  And I think the ones used in this study

5   were GMO, so I don't know how measurable the

6   quantity of nicotine was in there.  Do you

10   significantly faster when the nicotine is delivered

11   through a cigarette as opposed to some other

12   medium?

13        A,   Based on human physiology, if nicotine is

14   inhaled, that would be the fastest route because

15   it's arterial blood, yes.  If you use -~ if used

16   like a smokeless product, nicotine is absorbed

17   through the buccal cavity or buccal membranes and

18   goes through veinous blood, which of course passes

19   through your liver, et cetera.  So the pathway is

20   slower.

21             And I'm sure you've seen the

22   pharmacokinetic data on smoking versus smokeless

23   products, so yeah.

1        Q.   So is it fair to say that every cigarette

2   that Irwin Weinstein smoked contained ammonia?

3        A.   Based on my recollection of what

4   Irwin Weinstein smoked, my answer would have to

5   be  are you asking me added ammonia?

6        Q.   Yes, sir.

7        A.   My answer would have to be no because my

9       1945, if my memory serves me right.  Ammonia was

10   not added to reconstituted tobacco for Reynolds

11   products until the mid to late 1970s, so that

13        Q.   Okay.  Do you recall which brands of

14   cigarettes Mr. Weinstein smoked?

24   three Reynolds brands; Camel, Pall Mall, and Lucky

15
	A,  Again, I can go back and check.  I would

17
	I know there's certain brands that always

18
	have a filter on them.  I know that for sure like

19
	Salem and Winston.  Doral I don't usually spend a

20
	lot of time on.  It's possible there was a

21
	nonfiltered Doral, but I'd just have to go back and

22
	look.

23
	Q.  But it's your recollection sitting here

24
	that they were all filtered, right?

6   great.  I don't know.  I think they were just

7   another type of cigarette that Reynolds put out. .8       Just as I sit here, I don't know that there was any 9       special uniqueness to Doral at the time.

17   very honest with you here  most of the time most

18   of these cases are around Camel, Winston, Salem, so

19   I'm really  I spend a lot of time thinking about

20   those brands and not often about the Dorals and the

21   Vantages and other parts of the portfolio that

22   haven't historically been as popular as Camel,

23   Winston, and Salem quite frankly.

24             So knowing the history of every single

25   brand, you know, is not necessarily that simple.

2        Q.   Okay.

3        A.   I'm sure you're aware of what the Surgeon

4   General in '64 said about nicotine addiction and

5   cigarette smoking as a habit as opposed to an

6   addiction.

7        Q,   Is it fair to say that throughout

8   the vast majority of Mr. Weinstein's life,

9   R.J, Reynolds Tobacco Company did not consider

10   cigarettes to be addictive?

11        A.   I would say that s  that would be

12   correct.  In general, that would be correct, yes.

13        Q.   Would you agree with me that every

14   cigarette that Mr. Weinstein smoked caused him some

15   level of harm?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   Again, I would have to say that that

18   doesn't make toxicological sense.  Nonetheless, it

19   is known that your level of risk is dose  is in a

20   dose response.  So the more and longer in duration

21   that one would smoke, the higher the risk that one

22   would have of contracting a smoking-related

23   disease.  So it's hard for me to

15        A.   Well, you know, I don't know.  It's

16   difficult to say.  People derive benefits from

17   smoking.  There have been studies that provide at

18   least some scientific evidence about people's

19   attention span, and ability to retain information

23   where  the best answer I can give you with regard

6        A.   No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying

7   there are benefits derived from that.  Now,

8   that's  again, various Surgeon Generals' reports

9   have talked about, and specifically '64, about the

10   benefits of smoking.  So I'm just saying there's

11   not no benefit.  I would not say there's a health

12   benefit from the point of view of what would be

13   considered to be a health-related disease state

14   associated with smoking.  There's certainly no

4        Q.   You've seen studies with regard to

5   smoking and the onset of Parkinson's disease?

6        A.  No, no.  I'm saying that certainly

7   nicotine and nicotine analogs have been studied and

8   developed with the specific intent of trying to

9   treat certain diseases like Parkinson's,

10   Alzheimer's, MS, and things like that.  So it has

11   been looked at for those potential benefits.

12             To my understanding, I don't think

13   there's been any successful implementations of

14   those pharmaceuticals or I think strong enough

15   epidemiological information to suggest that smokers

16   have a lower incidence of those type of diseases.

17   It's been suggested and discussed, but I don't know

18   that it's been fully proven that, let's say, a

19   smoker has less of a chance of getting Alzheimer's

20   than one who doesn't.  I know it's been talked

8
	A.   I'm not.  All I'm saying is the way you

	asked me the first question is there were no
	

10
	health-related benefits or whatnot.  I'm thinking
	

11
	about all of the things I've read and heard about.
	

12
	That is certainly an area of - that was
	

13
	a topic of scientific conversation and
	

14
	investigation.  I'm just not completely up to spee

	on the verification of those types of theories.

	Q.   Fair enough.
	

20
	Is a low-tar or low-nicotine cigarette
	

21
	any less addictive than a cigarette with a higher
	

22
	level of tar and nicotine?

1   nicotine in a low-nicotine product or a

2   high-nicotine product would present any greater or

3   lesser risk of addiction.

4        Q.   Is it fair to say that the testimony that

5   you're going to be providing in this case is the

6   same as in other depositions where the depth and

7   scope of your opinions have been explored?

8        A,   Again, not knowing what you-all may ask

9   me on the stand, in general yes.  I mean, I have

10   not changed my disclosure.  The topics that are

11   covered in my disclosure are typically the things

12   that I would talk about in trial and in other

13   depositions, so in general my testimony is pretty

14   consistent from that aspect.

21   depositions.  I mean, obviously the company has

22   evolved over the past few years.  We have, like,

23   e-cigarettes in the marketplace; our nicotine

24   replacement therapies have hit the United States

13   we weren't regulated by FDA in '08.  Certainly                   f

14   those are topics that have been covered in trial               f

24        A.   Just off the top of my head  and they             f

25   vary a little bit depending upon the price of                      j

2   to make a pack of cigarettes, is what the

3   manufacturing cost is.

4        Q.   Okay.  And what's the profit level?

5        A,   Depending on the brand style, the profit

6   to Reynolds is about 38 cents.  The wholesalers and

7   retailers make about 38 cents each as well.  And

8   then the differential to the overall price is

9   basically excise taxes, federal tax, MSA payments,

10   et cetera.  So the vast majority of the money

11   collected on the sale of a pack of cigarettes goes

14   obviously as a public corporation, that the goal or

15   the intent with which Reynolds operates is to sell

16   as many cigarettes as it can?

17             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

18        A.  No, actually that's not the goal of

19   Reynolds.  Certainly we sell cigarettes, and we

20   would like to maintain or increase our share of the zi       marKeupxace 

22             But certainly our strategic intent has

23   been for years is transforming tobacco.  We are

24   actively pursuing ways, and through our product

25   executions, to get smokers to transition to less

3   Zonnic, abilities to get them to quit smoking.

4             So do we continue to sell cigarettes? Do

5   we want to pay attention to cigarette business?

6   Absolutely.  It's obviously a legal product that we

7   sell.  We've been in that industry for a long time, B       But I wouldn't say our specific goal is to sell

9       more cigarettes year in, year out.  No, that's not

10   the goal.

11        Q,   I hope I'm not misreading your testimony,

12   but is it Reynolds' intention to get smokers to

13   stop smoking cigarettes?

14        A.   We certainly offer those products that do

15   that.  Certainly Snus, we would like for people to

16   transition to Snus.  That would get them to stop

17   smoking cigarettes.  We make those product

4   from cigarettes and moving down the risk continuum

5   to products that might present less risk.

6             And certainly Reynolds, as a company, has

7   expanded that portfolio of product opportunities

8   about as wide as I can envision it at this point in

14   course up to the individual and it's individually             |

15   based, but people smoke for a lot of reasons.                      f

16              Certainly people smoke for physiological           f

17   reasons, and that certainly has an effect; and                   j

18   nicotine certainly plays a role in that.  But                      j

19   people like smoking; people like the taste of                      \

11        Q,   The fact that nicotine is considered

15        A.   Yeah, I don't think that's the case.  I

16   don't believe that to be the case.

17        Q.   Despite the fact that nicotine in

18   cigarettes is considered addictive, does that mean

10   that we make an additional warning saying that a

11   cigarette without additives doesn't mean that it's iz       sarer, just as a precaution.

9        A,   No, never.

10        Q.   Why are there carcinogens present in                   |

11   cigarette smoke?                                                                                     f

12        A.   Because that's what gets created when you

13   burn organic materials.  I mean, it's not -- I                   |

14   mean, it's not just tobacco.  I mean, any organic             |

15   leafy matter, you set it on fire, the smoke is                   j

16   going to contain carcinogens.  When you burn

17   cellulosic materials, you're going to create                        I

19             So the act of setting something on fire,           |

3        Q.   What is a nanogram?

4        A,   It's a billionth of a gram, so it's a

5   really tiny amount.

6        Q.   Is there any analogy or any example you

7   could give that may be more familiar to the jury

8   about how much a gram is and what a billionth of a

9   gram would reflect?

10        A.   I mean, there's 

11        Q.  How much does a pack of Equal weigh?

1^       A.   I think it s like a gram, something like

13   that, roughly.

14        Q.  So benzopyrene would be present at about

15   1 billionth of a pack of Equal under that scenario?

16        A.  Under that scenario, yeah.  It's like one

17   grain of Equal in a whole pack or maybe much more

18   than that.  You think about a billion pieces is

19   actually a lot of pieces.

20             So I think there's some analogies that

21   we've used in the past in terms of how many miles

22   of single sheets of paper one would have to lay out

23   in order to make that analogy.  There's a number of

24   ways to try to do it.  It's a small amount.

6   amounts of benzo(a)pyrene and other polycyclics in

7   cigarette smoke?

8        A.   Oh, yeah, they did.  Quite a lot of work

9   was done specifically in that area, yeah,

10        Q.   If Reynolds could have completely removed

11   benzo(a)pyrene, would they have done it?

12             MR. BERG:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   Sure.  That was what was suggested in a

14   bunch of our internal documents, is it would be

15   best if these things weren't there, if we could get

16   them out, we should; hence, the operating premise I

17   talked about before.  I think it's pretty clear, if

18   they could have gotten that they would have.

1   groups of researchers that investigate that.  My

2   agronomy program is partially doing that as well.

3             So yeah, we are always trying to work on

4   harm-reduction efforts, so that includes trying to

5   reduce PAHs and a whole host of other compounds as

6   well.

7        Q.   Earlier you referred to reconstituted

8   tobacco, expanded tobacco, porous paper, and other

9   cigarette design technologies that had been

10   incorporated into Mr. Weinstein's cigarettes from

11   Reynolds that he purchased.

12             Did those technologies affect the level

13   of BaP, benzo(a)pyrene, and other carcinogens in

14   smoke?

15        A.   They did, yes.

16        Q.   In what way?

17        A.  They generally have reduced those  the

18   levels of those compounds in smoke.

19        Q.  Okay.  From say the mid-1950s cigarettes

20   that Mr. Weinstein in fact was smoking -- a Camel

21   nonfilter or a Lucky Strike or a Pall Mall 

22   compared to in 2000 the nonfiltered versions of

23   Camel and Pall Mall and Lucky Strike, to what

24   extent had the yields of tar and polycyclic

1       reduced over that time period?

z                  a.  Weill i mean, as measured on a macnme,

3   they would be greater than 60 percent reduced.

4             But if you look at  I mean, I think

5   another point would be, there would be a

6   demonstrable difference if somebody smoked a Camel

7   nonfilter that was made in 1965 versus a Camel

8   nonfilter that's made today.  You are going to know

9   the difference.  There is so much more technology

10   in the Camel filter today that does reduce tar and

11   that is noticeable immediately upon smoking.  It

12   would be like night and day.  Even though they're

13   both nonfiltered cigarettes, it would definitely be

14   noticed.  Any smoker would be able to tell you

15   that.

J:

2          Q.   So with regard to people who would smoke             |

3    because of taste, is that also  does nicotine                     f

5          A,   It may.  You know, certainly nicotine

6    plays a - nicotine itself is bitter.  So I think                |

7    it plays a role in the overall taste and sensory                  j

8    experience of smoking.  I would not neglect it.                      ill

I

22   Reynolds intended to do that.  It's never been

23   produced.  It's been an allegation, but no one has

24   shown me a single document that makes that

25   suggestion.  It's an allegation.  So I'm waiting to

4    presented with one such document at the trial of

5    this matter?                                                                                                                  I

7          Q,  Okay.  You just testified a few minutes                j

8    ago that R.J. Reynolds has never added carcinogens             |

I

10    second ago?

11          A.   I do, yes.                                                                                             f

12          Q.   I thought we talked earlier about some of          |

13    the additives that R.J. Reynolds has added to                          j 141         cigarettes over rne years and now some or tnose                     $

15    additives when burned produce carcinogenic                                  f

16    substances.  Do you remember that line of                                     j

21          Q.   So would it be  isn't it true then that          f

22    R.J. Reynolds has added substances that would be                  |

23    carcinogenic in nature to its cigarettes over the

24    years?                                                                                                                                  j

25          A.   Well, again, no.  And I don't mean to

1   quibble the point, but there's a difference between

2   adding something that you know to be a carcinogen

3   to the tobacco product as opposed to adding

4   things  additives to tobacco that are like

5   tobacco and produce things that tobacco produces

6   when burned.

7             And, again, I would reiterate my -- my

8   testimony to you about how those additives are

9   evaluated from a toxicological standpoint.  Our

10   basis for approving additives for our products is

11   to determine whether or not those additives are

12   going to increase the inherent risk associated with

13   tobacco, and they do not.  And nor has any of the

*1*    t                   Ca LA L*> I. J- \*s JL   J L*- JL. vli* kj        L- JL X Ca L>        W v*         v  w        kj LA KJ l i L *JL L^ L* \I* \*A.       vy LA -L.        Ca VA. V-4. JL. L-. JL~ V L- h3        V-p V-/

15   suggested otherwise, whether it be FDA or HHS or

16   any state government that knows what our additives

17   are and have for decades.

18        Q.   So aside from whether it increases the

20   to cigarettes do in fact  when burned, do in fact

21   put off carcinogenic compounds, right?

22        A,   Well, I mean, that is possible; but, of

23   course, the point is all about increasing the risk.

24   That is what people concern themselves about.  That

25   is what toxicologists make their living making

3   using a particular product or in this case a

4   particular additive.

5             So that actually is precisely the point

6   of why those things are evaluated and why Reynolds

7   does take efforts in doing those investigations,

8   because we don't want to increase the inherent risk

9   associated with the products; and that's why

10   they're evaluated in that manner.

11        Q.   Okay.  So if I'm getting the point, while

12   some additives may give off carcinogenic compounds

13   when burned, they don't necessarily increase the

14   inherent risk in smoking?  Is that Reynolds' and

15   your position?

16        A.  Yes.  And by the same token, I would

17   not  just because if I burn sugar, refined sugar,

18   that I would find at every coffee table  just

19   because it may produce carcinogens, I'm not going

20   to call sugar a carcinogen.

21        Q.   Okay.

22        A.   If that makes sense.  So I wouldn't make

23   that connection.

Dr. Figlar will discuss tine ways m. which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general deduction technologies and how these techniques-m 'us$& in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples, {^ph a$^yecc^ltutnd tobacco, which was first used commeroialiy by Reynolds Bftd is now utilized by most tobi&co companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted,tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "taiM and nicotine yields, and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigmWe. mmii&cture dne to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general rectoion broadly * he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been

smoked in this case.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower V products, coupled with government, and public health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic, cigarette mamifecturers have substantially lowered the FfC "tar*' and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decadei  He will testify that :ftie sales-wefghted' FTC 'W and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% percent since the 19S0*s( from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams *W mi 0.9 mg nicotine today, He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "to" yields down by designing and lantiching low Mtar'' and/or ultra low "tar* brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Figlar

SECOND AMENDED SEVERED COMPLAINT

Plaintiff SHEILA WBINSTEIN, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF IRWIN WEINSTE1N, sues DEFENDANTS and alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

1. Plaintiff is a member of (lie class of persons described by the Supreme Court of Florida in Engk v. Lig&tt Group, Inc., 945 So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006) CWc"). That class is described as "[alll Florida citizens and residents, and their survivors* who have suffered,pgNbr=192
presently suffer or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine," Id at 1256, Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Engk,

2.         This action is timely because this Second Amended Severed Complaint relates back, for all purposes permitted under Florida law, to the initial Complaint which was filed within one (1) year of the Florida Supreme Court's mandate in Engk. This action was formerly part of a multi-plaintiff action, Shtila Weinstein et, al v. RJ. Reynolds et. ait case number 50-2007-CA*023835-XXXX MB AA. Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the initial action was voluntarily severed and the Plaintiff, Mrs, Sheila Weinstein, as personal representative of the estate of Irwin Weinstein, now files this Second Amended Severed Complaint.

3.         Plaintiff Sheila Weinstein's Decedent died on June 25, 2005. Plaintiff Sheila Weinstein is or will be the Personal Representative of the Estate of Irwin Weinstein. Ixtters of Administration will be forthcoming and filed with the Clerk of this Court. This action is brought on behalf of the Decedent's survivors and Estate. The potential beneficiaries of a recovery by Plaintiff in this action and the relationship to the Decedent arc as follows:

Potential Beneficiary_______________________________Relationship

Sheila Weimtem                                                                      Spouse

Jeffrey Weinstein                                                                     Son

Andrew Weinstein                                                                    Son

4 The Decedent herein, Irwin Weinstein, is referred to as the "Decedent or the "Smoker," Decedent was a Florida resident from 1989 until his death, Decedent's death certificate also establishes that Decedent, Irwin Weinstein, was a Florida resident at all times relevant,

2pgNbr=193
5.         Defendant Philip Morris-USA Inc. ("Philip Morris U.S.A.") is a Virginia corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

6.         Defendant Lorillard Tobacco Company (which assumed the assets and liabilities of Lorillard, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

7.         Defendant RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company* individually and as successor by merger to Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, individually and as successor by merger to The American Tobacco Company, is a North Carolina corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times to this action.

8.         Defendant Liggett Group, LLC ("Liggett") is a Delaware limited liability company that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action, Liggett is a "citizen" of Florida for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1331 because one or more of tho members of Liggett is a "citizen" of Florida.

9.            Defendant Liggett Group, LLC (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., f/k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., f/k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company) ("Liggett") is a Delaware limited liability company that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and It did so during all times relevant to this action. Upon information and belief, one of its members is a Florida citizen making Liggett a Florida citizen for purposes of jurisdiction.

10.          Defendant Vector Group Ltd. Inc. (f/k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc.) ("Vector1') is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in tho State of Florida and has its principal place of business in Miami, Dade County, Florida, making it a Florida citizen.

3pgNbr=194
11. Liggett, Brooke Group, Ltd, Inc., ("BGL") and Brooke Group Holding, Inc., ("BGH") were defendants in the Engh class action. The class was estimated to include several hundred thousand class members seeking damages against Defendants, including Liggett and BGL. On July 7,1999, after a lengthy jury trial in what is known as "Phase T of the case, the jury found Liggett and BGL liable to the class, exposing them to substantial judgments for

compensatory and punitive damages.

12, In September and October 1999, Defendants Liggett and BGL undertook a sham reorganization of BGL that involved the creation of several new holding companies, multiple mergers, acquisitions, and the shuffling of BGL's assets, including Liggett, in an attempt to mislead or defraud creditors, including Engk class members and the Plaintiff herein, and/or to improperly divert revenues and assets of Liggett and BGL. This sham reorganization established Vector as the parent of BGH and Liggett (n/k/a Liggett Group, LLC).

13.           These transactions were the product of an actual intent on the part of these Defendants to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, in violation of Florida's Uniform Fraudulent

Transfer Act,

14,           In addition to the reorganization and transfer of assets described above, the

management, officers, directors, personnel, location of operation, assets, liabilities, business operations, and stockholders of BGL remained the same when the name was changed to Vector; nominal consideration was involved in the reorganization; the vast majority of Liggett's revenues continue to be diverted to Vector to fund Vector's cigarette operations; and Bennett S. UBow, ihrough Vector, continued after the reorganization to exercise unilateral control over the assets of BGL and BGH (including the asset Liggett), as he had with the predecessor entities.

4pgNbr=195
15. Vector therefore is the successor to the original cigarette manufacturer, Liggett, whieh changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd., Inc. ("BGL"). Vector is a successor to BGL as a mere continuation of BGL and Liggett. Vector is a successor io BGL by way of de facto merger

with BGL. Vector also is a successor to BGH.

16,          Vector is but Engk Defendant BGL (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., f/k/a Liggett &

Myers, Inc. f/k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.) by another name.

17.          Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is a mere instrumentality and/or alter ego of Vector. Assets and profits of Liggett have been, and continue to be, improperly divcitcd from Liggett and BGL in an effort to mislead or defraud creditors, and/or hide assets of Liggett and BGL, from creditors, including Plaintiff herein, and for other improper

purposes.

18.       Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is the agent of Vector

and manifests no separate corporate interests of its own. Vector acknowledges Liggett as its agent for purposes including, but not limited to, the sale, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Liggett has accepted by act or word to be the agent of Vector and acquiesced in the control exercised over it by Vector, Vector further exercises control over Liggett through the formation of Liggett Vector Brands, Inc., a company controlled by Vector, which now has taken over the sales and marketing of both Vector Tobacco, Inc., and Liggett,

19. Joinder of Vector as a party defendant is not "fraudulent", within the meaning of decisions interpreting 28 U.S.C. 1441. In remanding a substantially identical action to state court alter it was removed to the United States District Court, Judge James Lawrence King held, "Plaintiffs have laid out a reasonable argument that Vector is a liable successor... . Plaintiffs have established a possibility that Vector controls [Defendant] Liggett and is liable as LiggetCs

alter ego .... It is possible that a state court will find a cause of action against Vector." Milter, elal v. RJ Reynolds, et al, 07-212274 (S.D. Fla. Aug 17,2007). Other judges throughout the Southern District of Florida agree with this conclusion. See Brown v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-60432-CIV-MDDLBBROOK.S (S.D. Fla. Aug. 22,2007); Abnso v. RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., Ho. 07-22252-dV-KlNO (S.D. Fla. Sep 11, 2007); Ross v. RJ. Reynold? Tobacco Co., No. 07-22251-CIV-K1NG (S,D, Fla. Sep. 11,2007); Davis v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co,> No. 07-223Q8-C1V-MORENO(S.D. Fla, Sep. 25, 2007); Caprio v. RJ, Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-20712-C1V-JGRDAN (S.D, Fla. Sep. 28,2007); Ellis v. HJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-21503-C1V HIGHSMITH (S.D. Fla. Oct. 2,2007). Accordingly, no basis for the removal of tlus action to the United States District Court exists because the United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.

20.       The Council tor Tobacco Research U.S.A., Inc. (the "Council") and the Tobacco Institute, Inc. (the "Institute"), al all times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United Slates both in connection with and on behalf of the Defendants.

21.          The Decedent purchased, smoked, and was addicted to cigarette products containing nicotine which were the subject ofEngk, The cigarette products containing nicotine were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by Defendants at all material times.

22.       At all times relevant to this action, all Defendants manufactured and distributed tobacco products containing nicotine throughout Florida and the United States. The Defendants, including Vector, were and remain Engle defendants.

23.       At all times relevant to this action, the Smoker was a Florida resident and citizen (1) who was addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were

6pgNbr=197
so in

designed, manufactured, advertised and marketed by all of the Defendants and (2) who did  sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time period to cause injury in the form of diseases and medical conditions described herein, which was caused by his addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine, and which manifested during the class period, specifically including, but not limited to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cerebral vascular disease. Additionally, the decedent died as a result of the disease or diseases.

24.       Decedent's medical records indicate that he was diagnosed with COPD on or about July 26, 1990. The death certificate indicates that chronic airway obstruction was the immediate cause of Decedent's death. The death certificate ftirther indicates that Decedent, Irwin Weinslem, died in Florida on June 25,1995.

25.        Upon information and belief the smoking decedent, smoked several different brands of cigarettes and most likely smoked cigarettes manufactured by each of the defendants including their predecessors and successors.

26.       Upon information and belief the Decedent, Leo Skolnick smoked the following brands of cigarettes. Said information is subject to additional discovery,

27. At oil times relevant to this action, the Smoker herein was (1) addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were designed* manufactured, advertised, and marketed by all of the Defendants, and (2) did so in sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time period to cause or substantially contribute to causing injury or aggravation of a

preexisting condition in the form

of diseases and medical conditions, including the form of

diseases

and medical conditions thai ultimately resulted in the injuries of the Smoker.

SpgNbr=199
28, In tingle, the Florida Supreme Court approved certification for liability purposes of a class including all Florida citizens and residents, arid their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer, or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.

29, The Florida Supreme Court decertified the Engle class because class-wide treatment of causation and damages was not feasible. The Florida Supreme Court expressly reserved to class members, including Plaintiffs, the right to bring individual actions against Defendants for smoking-rclated injuries and damages, including punitive damages.

30.     Plaintiff asserts the jury findings from the Phase I Engle trial which were given res judicata effect by the Florida Supreme Court, including but not limited to the following;

a.

and stomach cancer,

b.    Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

o,     All Defendants placed cigarette on the market that were defective and

unreasonably dangerous.

9pgNbr=200
d.       All Defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false or misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking

cigarettes or both.

e.       All Defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health

effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment,

f.       All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.

g.      All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of fact made by Defendants.

h, Ail Defendants were negligent 31. As a direct and proximate result of the Decedent's addiction to smoking Defendants* cigarettes, the Decedent suffered bodily injury and died. Defendants' cigarettes caused the Decedent to develop one or more cigarette-related diseases or medical conditions that resulted in or substantially contributed to the Decedent's death. Plaintiff claims all damages allowed by the Florida Wrongful Death Act,

32, Alternatively, in the event the Defendants contend that the Decedent died of some cause unrelated to smoking cigarettes, Plaintiff asserts a claim for survival damages pursuant to Section 46.021, Florida Statutes, as the Decedent suffered past physical and mental and emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and medical expense for care and treatment. During the period before the Decedent died and in conjunction with an alternative survival claim, Plaintiff also asserts a loss of consortium claim and alleges as a direct and proximate result of the allegations contained in this Complaint, Plaintiff has suffered and will

10pgNbr=201
continue to suffer the loss of services, consortium, and care and comfort of the Decedent's society because of his injuries, disabilities and death, and has incurred expenses for medical

treatment rendered to the Decedent.

33. Additionally, whether part of a wrongful death or survival claim, the Decedent's cigarette-related illnesses resulted in his sustaining aggravation of previously existing conditions, physical pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, and medical expense.

34. The Plaintiffs Decedent bears some measure of fault, but less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing his respective smokmg-related injuries and death. The Plaintiff's Decedent acts or omissions relating U> ^ frequency and duration of his efforts to quit smoking were a partial proximate cause, in combination with the acts and omissions of Defendants, of his injuries, The Plaintiff therefore seeks apportionment of fault and damages between the Decedent's survivors and Estate, and each Defendant who is responsible for damages on all Counts other than those alleging intentional torts.

35.       Venue is proper in this Circuit because, at all times material to this action, the Smoker either resided, suffered injuries or died in Palm Beach County, Florida.

Objection. This interrogatory is overly broad and incapable of an accurate response. It is overly broad because, at a minimum, the identification of every publication Decedent ever "read" is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It is incapable of an accurate response because neither Plaintiff nor any other person can recall every publication the Decedent ever purchased, received, or read; nor can the Plaintiff supply such information for another person, Including the Decedent.
