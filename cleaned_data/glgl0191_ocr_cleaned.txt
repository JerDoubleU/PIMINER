11   assert attorney-client privilege to the extent

12   there are communications with lawyers; but I'll

2
	because I think it's an important matter.  It

	doesn't relieve me of any additional duties.

4

10
	document you have, I'm not sure.  Are you talking

	about the expert witness list?

12
	A.   Yes.  The section on Page 7 that says       [

13
	"Previous Testimony."

14
	Q.   Right.  And it lists it looks like four

15
	cases.  You've actually testified more than that,

	testified at trial three times; and I've testified

	in five depositions, I believe.

23

2
	addition
	to what's listed here, I would have

3
	testified
	in a case named Schlenther.  That would

5
	Q.
	Can you spell that for us, sir?

6
	A.

8
	is the sp
	elling.

9
	Q.
	And you said that was an Engle case?

10
	A.
	Yes.

11
	Q.
	And where did that trial take place?

12
	A.
	Let's see.  I don't recall the name of

13
	the count
	y-                                                                    \

	Was that trial testimony or simply

15
	deposition testimony?
	
16
	A.
	That was trial testimony.

17
	Q.
	What other trials have you testified in?

18
	A.
	I've testified in Hallgren, and I've        j

19
	testified
	in Callaway.                                \

20
	Q.
	So that's three Engle trials.  Are those

21
	the only
	three Engle trials you've given testimony

	in?

	What about deposition testimony?

		In terms of deposition testimony, my most

	recent deposition testimony was in a case by the

2
	name of Skolnick.

3
	Q.   Any other cases?

4
	A.   I've provided testimony, as I indicated,    j

5
	in four other Engle cases.  Reese would have been

6
	one, Hallgren would have been one.  Let's see.  I

7
	don't have the other one in my mind as I sit here.

8
	Q.   Number 10 on Schedule A asks for copies

9
	of all time records reflecting the time you spent

10
	on cases.  Do you have that?

11
	A.   I have no time records.

12
	Q.   You don't keep track of the time you

13
	spend on these cases?

14
	A.   No.

15
	Q.   On Page 7 of this expert witness list,

16
	your disclosure, it talks about fees.  It indicates

17
	that you do not charge a fee for deposition or

18
	trial testimony, and you receive no additional

19
	compensation for your time spent as an expert

20
	witness in litigation.
 i;

21
	A.   That's correct, I receive no

22
	compensation.  As far as my salary, I would be paid

23
	the same salary no matter if I do this or not.

24
	Q.   But this is something that as an employee

25   of R.J. Reynolds you do, correct?

1        A.   It's something that I do because I think

2   it's very important; and I am an employee of

3   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, yes.

4        Q.   Okay.  I didn't ask you why you do it.

5   It's something you do as your employment with

6   R.J. Reynolds, correct?

7             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

8   It's been asked and answered.  Move to strike the

9   prefatory comment, which is not a question.

10        A.   If by your question you're asking am I

11   required to do it by the company; no, I'm not

12   required to do it by the company.  It's something

13   that I've chosen to do voluntarily.  I am an

14   employee of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

15   BY MR. HAMMER:

16        Q.   It indicates that you spent approximately

17   5 percent of your time or less serving as an expert

18   witness in litigation during the past five years.

19        A.   That's correct.  It's something that

20   comes in sort of fits and starts.  There will be

21   periods where it consumes a fair amount of time,

22   and there will be periods where it doesn't consume

23   any.  But probably 5 percent generally.  As a

24   result, of course, I end up working on evenings and

25   weekends to accomplish all the things I need to.

1   the only time you've spent meeting with the lawyers

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Now, according to your CV you were born PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED that correct?

6        A.       Yes.

8        A.       Yes.

9        Q.       Okay.  Have you looked at your CV

10   recently and reviewed that for its accuracy?                       f

11        A.   Yes, I have looked at it recently.  It's    \

12   something that I update from time to time.  I do              I

13   plan to update it sometime in the near future and            \

14   add some additional presentations and publications          f

15   that have occurred since it was last updated.

16        Q.   Okay.  Can you give me the names of those

17   additional publications since it's been last

18   updated?

19        A.   I can't.  I don't have them all

20   memorized, but I can tell you about them in

21   general.  One, for example, would be a publication

22   reporting on a survey of smokeless tobacco products

23   in the U.S., and so it's looking at the levels of

24   certain constituents in the smokeless tobacco

2             There's been additional publications in

3   the area of looking at data from a study called

4   NHANES.  So this is a large study  a National

5   Health study that does some measurements of

6   biomarkers; and in that study it has done some

7   measurements related to, for example, cadmium

8   exposures.  So there's publications in that general

9   area.

10             Another example would be a publication in

11   the area of cider toxicity associated with

12   smokeless tobacco preparations, cigarette smoke

13   condensate, as well as nicotine.  That would be

14   another example.

15             There's been a presentation in the area

16   of clinical studies efforts that evaluated

17   exposures when smokers switched from using

18   cigarettes to reducing their cigarettes on a

19   week-to-week basis and using modern smoke-free

20   tobacco products.  So these are some of the

25   sometime, probably in the month of January.

	her because she sort of has one foot in her
	
9
	previous
	role and one foot in her new role.

10
	Q.
	And what is her name?  I'm sorry.           \

	A.
	Ms. Kelly Harger.                          i

12
	Q.
	And what is her new role going to be?

13
	A.
	Her new role is in our regulatory

14
	compliance team; and so she'll be part of the team    [
	
15
	that prep
	ares our regulatory compliance submissions

16
	to the FDA, for example.
	
17
	Q.
	And what does --                           [

18
	A.
	I failed to mention Dr. Leanne Lee.

19
	Q.
	What exactly does the clinical studies

20
	team do,
	sir?

21
	A.
	The clinical studies team, as the name

22
	would imp
	ly, designs and leads clinical studies.

23
	Q.
	Clinical studies regarding what?

24
	A.
	Clinical studies regarding tobacco

25  products.

1   new products that are developed.  For example, one

2   type of study design would be to recruit smokers

3   and to randomize those to different groups; and in

4   terms of those different groups, one group may

5   continue smoking cigarettes, another group may be

6   one that is switched to a modern tobacco-free

7   product, and another may be one that goes through a

8   period of forced abstinence from tobacco products.

9             So in such a study design  the one I'm

10   describing, for example -- may be in a confinement

11   setting within a clinic.  The types of things that

12   would be studied would be how people interact with

13   the different products, what types of exposure they

14   may have to smoke or tobacco or particular

15   compounds or toxicants that may be present.  It may

16   also do measurements of subjective outcomes, that

17   is subject reported outcomes for various types of

18   questionnaire.  And so it would be this type of a

19   clinical study.

20             They're all conducted according to the

21   guidelines prescribed by the federal government in

22   the Code of Federal Regulations; and they are done

23   with initial review through an institutional review

24   board, subject monitoring, bioanalytical analysis,

25   and so on.  They would be very much like the types

2   they're monitored and the way that they're reviewed

3   and so on, much like a pharmaceutical study might

4   be done, but they're not focused on

5   pharmaceuticals.

6        Q.   And when you conduct these studies, are

7   these studies recorded?                                                                   j

11        A.   Yes.  All of our documents, all of our      ^

12   health-related documents, all of our studies that     f

13   would be part of our health-related documents are     jj

14   provided to the FDA.  Those are provided on a

15   periodicity prescribed by the FDA.  They decide

16   when they want to collect those documents.  But

17   they've all been provided.  They've also been

18   provided through other particular submissions or      I

19   actions.

20             So, for example, as part of the review of

21   dissolvable tobacco products, all of our documents

22   there, all of our study data to that point in time,

23   would have been provided to the FDA for their

	R.J. Reynolds for how long, sir?

2
	A.   I started working for R.J. Reynolds

3
	Tobacco Company in 1980, so a little over 32 years.

4
	Q.   And while you were  when you first        \

5
	started working for R.J. Reynolds you were still in

6
	school?

7
	A.   No.  When I first started working for

8
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company I just completed my

9
	master's degree in chemistry.                          !

10
	Q.   But you continued schooling after working

11
	for R.J. Reynolds, correct?

12
	A.   Yes.  After a brief period of time there    j

13
	was an opportunity.  The company had started an

14
	education program, and it's something that I chose

15
	to take advantage of.

16
	Q.   What does that mean, the company started    \

17
	an education program?

18
	A.   The company has a long-standing program

19
	whereby they encourage people to continue

20
	furthering their education.  So someone can choose

21
	to pursue a degree, an additional degree; and upon

22
	completing successfully the classes around that

23
	degree and achieving a certain grade -- in other

24
	words, they have to do well in the class

25  generally -- they can submit that and have

reimbursement for tuition.  So it's something that many, many employees at Reynolds have taken advantage of.

Q.   And so R.J. Reynolds, with regard to your continued schooling, they actually paid for your schooling?

A. In terms of my Ph.D. work, R.J. Reynolds paid for the classwork; that is, they didn't pay for it, but I was reimbursed after the fact. They did not pay for the time that I spent doing all of the research or any of the other associated costs. But as far as the actual cost of the courses, they did reimburse me for that, yes, for the Ph.D.

Q.   Do you currently own shares of stock with the company?

A.   I do, yes.

How many shares do you own, sir? I currently own about

shares.

Do you know what the stock is presently

Q.   Did you give a deposition back in April of this year in the case of Hiott, H-I-O-T-T?

A.   I did, yes.

Q.  And did you say at that time you owned 10,000 shares?

A.   I believe that I did.  After that

deposition I went and checked, and I owned

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED shares.  I used a round number.

Q.   Have you received a bonus for this year, 2012?

A.   No, I've not.

Q.   If you haven't received a bonus yet, do you anticipate receiving a bonus?

A.   In terms of our compensation structure, that's something that will be determined after year-end.  We're currently in our annual performance evaluation process.  It will depend, in part, upon company performance and so on; but it's possible that I will receive one.  I don't know that I will or I won't at this point.

Q.   Did you receive one in 2011?

A.   Yes.

	such.  It's part of our total compensation.

4
	There's never anything that says "this is your

	A.   In 2011 it would have been very similar,    j

	about        .  It varied by a couple percent.       I

	Q.   And in 2011 did you receive stock as part

18
	of your bonus as well?                               \

20
	the bonus.

21
	Q.   Do you receive stock on a yearly basis?

	Q.   With regard to your preparation for your

6
	deposition in this case, what have you actually

7
	reviewed to prepare for this deposition?            \

8
	A.   I've reviewed the documents that I

9
	brought today to learn about the plaintiff and

10
	about the decedent.  I've tried to understand the

11
	brand history and a little bit about the            

12
	individuals in this case.                           =

13
	Q.   So the documents that you're referring

14
	to, would those be the ones that we marked as

15
	Exhibits 6, 7, and 8, which include the rogs, the

16
	amended rogs, and Exhibit Number 2 from Mr. Cohen's

17
	depo?

18
	A.   That's correct, yes.

19
	Q.   And you said you also have with you there

20
	as Exhibit Number 5 the fifth amended complaint.

21
	Did you review that --

22
	A.   I did, yes.

23
	Q.   -- in preparation for this case?

24
	A.   I'm sorry.  Yes, I did.

	No.

4
	Q.
	Were you provided any depositions?          \

5
	A.
	No, I wasn't.  Other than, again, the one

6
	page that
	was listed as Exhibit 2.

7
	Q.
	So obviously you were aware  because

8
	there was
	an exhibit from a depo, you were aware      \

9
	that the
	deposition or a series of depositions were

10
	taken for
	Mr. Cohen, correct?                       j

11
	A.
	I'm not aware of what other documents;

12
	but my understanding was this was a single page of
	
13
	something
	else, yes.

14
	Q.
	Well, it was a single page of a            [

15
	deposition, right?
	
16
	A.
	That's now my understanding, yes.           |

17
	Q.
	Did you review any deposition testimony     =

18
	of Mr. Co

19
	A.
	No, I didn't.

20
	Q.
	Did you ask to review that?

21
	A.
	No.

22
	Q.
	So how much time have you spent preparing

23
	for this

24
	A.
	I've spent about four hours preparing for

	Q.   Okay.  You said that you met with the

2
	lawyers for three or four hours yesterday.

3
	A.   Yes.

4
	Q.   Does that include that time?

5
	A.   It does, yes.

6
	Q.   So other than the three or four hours you   \

	spent with the lawyers yesterday, you did no other

8
	preparation.  Is that correct?                      j

9
	A.   The only other thing I did is I did have    \

10
	a look through my reliance list materials and

11
	looked at some of the documents there, but that was

12
	the only additional thing.  It was three to four      j

13
	hours total.  During that time I read the documents

14
	that I've brought with me and prepared myself in

15
	that way.

16
	Q.  And I know I asked you about the reading

17
	of Mr. Cohen's deposition, but I just want to make    [

18
	sure we're clear.  As far as any deposition that      j

19
	was taken in this case -- whether it be Mr. Cohen

20
	or family, friends or relatives or experts or

21
	treating doctors, you've read no depositions in

22
	this case?

23
	A.   That's correct.

24
	Q.   Is that correct?

3
	A.   No, I haven't.                            [

4
	Q.   Based upon your review of the materials     [

5
	that you did review in this case, that being the

6
	amended -- the fifth amended complaint; the rogs;

7
	Exhibit 2 from Mr. Cohen's depo; and the amended

8
	rogs, which are marked as Exhibits 5, 6, 7, 8 to

9
	this deposition, what is your understanding of the

10
	brands of cigarettes that Mrs. Cohen smoked?

11
	A.   My understanding -- there seem to be some

12
	inconsistency in the materials that I read.  But

13
	based upon the -- if I may refer to it -- the

14
	one-page document, the one that's listed as           1

15
	Exhibit 2 originally, this provides information

16
	about the brands, it looks like quite a number of

17
	different brands throughout the years; and these

18
	brands -- some are R.J. Reynolds brands, some are

19
	not.

20
	Q.   And the list you're referring to, did you

21
	compare that to the rogs?

22
	A.   In terms of the materials that I read, I

23
	believe that there were some  there may have been

24
	one other area; but in terms of the brand history,
 i

25   I focused upon this document primarily.

1        Q.   And what were you able to determine based

2   upon your review of Mrs. Cohen's smoking history?

3        A.   As I indicated in my answer a moment ago,

4   Mrs. Cohen smoked a number of different cigarette

5   brands; and that would have included both

6   R.J. Reynolds brands and other brands.  She didn't

7   seem to smoke any particular brand for an extended

8   period of time, and would have smoked both

9   non-menthol cigarette brands and menthol cigarette

10   brands.

11        Q.   Okay.  I understand that.  But my

12   question is, based upon your review of the

13   documents you were provided, what is your

14   understanding -- what were you able to determine

15   about Mrs. Cohen's smoking history, what she smoked

16   and when she smoked it?

17             MR. KREINER:  Steve, do you want him to

18   just read Exhibit 7 or --

19             MR. HAMMER:  Well, no.  What I want is 

20   I mean, he basically reviewed materials.

22        Q.   You reviewed materials, correct, sir?

23        A.   I did, yes.

24        Q.   Okay.  And in reviewing those materials

25   did you form an opinion as to what Mrs. Cohen's

1   smoking history was?

2        A.   I did, yes.  I as I indicated earlier,

3   her smoking history was quite varied in that she

4   smoked a number of different cigarette brands that

5   are described in this particular exhibit.  They

6   would have included non-menthol brands and menthol

7   cigarette brands.  So her history was somewhat

8   limited in terms of any particular cigarette brand,

9   but she smoked quite a different number of them

10   over the years that she smoked.

11        Q.   I'd like to narrow that down, if you can,

12   sir.

13             So what I'm going to ask you again is

14   based upon your review of the materials that

15   you were provided, what brands -- as far as the

16   history goes, what brands did Mrs. Cohen smoke?

17        A.   You'd like me to indicate the individual

18   brands that are listed in this document, is my

19   interpretation of your question.

20             My understanding is that she smoked Camel

21   cigarettes, that she smoked Chesterfield

22   cigarettes, that she smoked Marlboro cigarettes,

23   that she smoked Kent cigarettes, that she smoked

24   Winston cigarettes, that she smoked L&M cigarettes,

25   that she smoked Kool cigarettes, that she smoked

	Salem cigarettes, and that she smoked Newport

	cigarettes.

3
	Q.  And were you able to make a determination

4
	as to when she smoked those items based upon your

5
	review of the materials, sir?

6
	A.   Based upon this document it indicates

7
	that she started smoking about 1940.

8
	Q.   And based upon your review of the

9
	materials, were you able to determine  you said

10
	you formed an opinion based upon your review of the

11
	materials, correct, sir?

12
	A.   I formed an impression from what I've

13
	read here, but I don't know that these facts are      I

14
	accurate or not.  It's just a document that I

15
	reviewed.  It indicates a date for the first time

16
	that she's smoking cigarettes here.  At least the

17
	first time that it lists cigarette smoking is in      [

18
	1940.

19
	Q.   I understand what's on the list, but what   [

20
	I'm asking, sir, is in your review of the

21
	documents, that list including the rogs and

22
	including the complaint because that's what you

23
	said you reviewed in forming your opinions in this

1        Q.   So in review of your -- of the materials

2   in this case and the opinions you developed, did

3   you form an opinion as to the brands, as to when

4   Mrs. Cohen smoked them, and the duration that she

5   smoked each brand?

6        A.   If you mean by did I form an opinion, did

7   I take anything more than what's written on the

8   page, I did not.  I reviewed these materials, I

9   accept that it gives a series of dates, a series of

10   brands.  I don't have any way to evaluate that by

11   looking at this document as being accurate or not.

12             I accept that if this is an accurate

13   review of her smoking history, that she started

14   smoking in 1940 and that she smoked a number of

15   different brands, as I indicated earlier, and that

16   in each of the cases of those individual brands she

17   would have smoked them from a few years to several

18   years.

19        Q.  Which brands of R.J. Reynolds cigarettes

20   did Mrs. Cohen smoke?

21        A.   Mrs. Cohen smoked Camel, Mrs. Cohen

22   smoked Winston, and Mrs. Camel  Mrs. Cohen smoked

23   Salem.  In addition, according to this list, she

24   smoked Kool, which is currently a Reynolds brand.

25        Q.   And you mentioned Kool as being presently

1   an R.J. Reynolds brand.  It was a different brand

2   when she smoked it?

3        A.   Yes.  At the time that she smoked it, it

4   would have been a B&W brand.

5        Q.   Okay.  And B&W is a predecessor company

6   of RJR, correct?

7        A.   Yes.  Well, let me clarify, if I may.

8   It's not a predecessor.  It was a different

9   company, and it's one that merged with

10   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  So it didn't

11   precede it, per se, but B&W and Reynolds merged

12   some years ago now.

13        Q.   And so basically R.J. Reynolds subsumed

14   Brown & Williamson, correct?

15             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

16        A.   I don't know the legalities of that, but

17   the brands that were once B&W brands are now

18   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brands.

19   BY MR. HAMMER:

20        Q.   Were there any warning labels on the

21   cigarette packages when Mrs. Cohen first smoked an

22   R.J. Reynolds brand?

23        A.  No.  At the time that she started

24   smoking, there would not have been warning labels

25   on cigarette packs.

1        Q.   And as far as the time frame of when she

2   smoked the R.J. Reynolds brands, what is your

3   understanding of the period of time that she smoked

4   Camel, the period of time she smoked Winston, the

5   period of time she smoked Kool, and the period of

6   time she smoke Salem?

7        A.   My understanding from, again, what's

8   marked Plaintiff's Exhibit 7  and my

9   understanding is, as it's indicating in this

10   document, assuming this is an accurate history for

11   her  is that she smoked Camel from 1940 to 1948,

12   so for an eight-year period; that she smoked

13   Winston in 1956 until about 1960, so approximately

14   a four-year period; that she smoked Salem from

15   about 1970 to about 1976, so about a six-year

16   period; and that she smoked Kool from 1963 until

17   about 1970, so about a seven-year period.

18        Q.   And with regard to the other brands that

19   she smoked, what is your understanding of the time

20   period that she smoked those?

21        A.   Again, my understanding of the time

22   period, assuming this is an accurate history as

23   provided in this document, and my understanding is

24   that she smoked Chesterfields from 1948 until 1950,

25   that she smoked Marlboro from 1950 until 1953, that

4
	Q.   In your opinion was Mrs. Cohen a
	i

5
	stakeholder in the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
	i

6
	A.   Yes.  In my view all smokers that smoke
	

7
	our brands would be one group of stakeholders.
	I

8
	Q.   And what is your definition of a
	I

9
	"stakeholder"?
	

10
	A.  A stakeholder is one that has an interest
	
11
	in the company and that the company has an interes
	t

12
	in.
	i

13
	Q.   And based on your review of the
	1

14
	documents, what was  as far as Mrs. Cohen's
	

15
	interest in RJR, what was her interest in that?
	\

16
	A.   Her interest in that was that she was
	I

17
	someone that smoked cigarettes, she was considerir
	ig  I

18
	various brands, and at some points in time she
	

19
	chose to smoke R.J. Reynolds brands.
	

20
	Q.   And you said that a stakeholder is also
	a

21
	person that the company has an interest in.  What
	f

22
	interest did RJR have in Mrs. Cohen?
	1

23
	A.   RJR had a variety of interests in smokers

	as a stakeholder group.  R.J. Reynolds had the

2   the products, doing research around the products;

3   and trying to develop new and improved products.

4        Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds operate its business

5   with Mrs. Cohen's best interest in mind?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7        A.   I'm not sure exactly what you mean by

8   that.  I think that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

9   has operated its business in the interest of all of

10   its stakeholders, recognizing that we produce a

11   product that's a complex product, it's a product

12   that's had a lot of research and development, it's

13   a product that has tried to meet changing

14   expectations and demands from consumers in the

15   marketplace.

16             So I think within that context Mrs. Cohen

17   and all smokers are part of the stakeholders in

18   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

2
	A.   I did, yes.

3
	Q.   And what was involved in your research of

4
	the company?

5
	A.   What was involved in my research of the

6
	company was to read various materials about the

7
	company, to meet with individuals from the company,

8
	to come and tour the research facility and meet

9
	with scientists at the company.  All of that would

10
	have been part of what I did before considering

11
	working at R.J. Reynolds.                             [

12
	Q.   Prior to working at R.J. Reynolds, did      \

13
	you consider working at any other tobacco company

14
	or was it only R.J. Reynolds?

15
	A.   No.  I had job offers from a number of

16
	companies, but this was the only tobacco company.

17
	Q.   What other job offers did you have at       j

	that time?

19
	A.   I had job offers from a company that

20
	worked in the development and the sales of

21
	chromatography-related products and technologies, I

22
	had a job offer from a petroleum company.  Those

23
	are the ones that come to mind.

1   R.J. Reynolds?

2        A.   In terms of my entire education, my

3   youth, formative years, it was something that we

4   were taught in school, it was something that was in

5   Reader's Digest, in the Popular Press.  So there

6   was a lot of information that I had about

7   cigarettes, about tobacco in general just from

8   having grown up in the United States throughout the

9   1960s and '70s.

10        Q.   Did you do any research with regard to

11   the addictive nature of cigarettes or the harms

12   that cigarettes may have?

13        A.   Again, in health class throughout my

14   education we were taught about the risks of

15   cigarette smoking.  I was aware of labels 

16   warning labels on cigarette packs.  This was part

17   of society in general.  There was widespread

18   awareness of these types of topics.

19             As far as addictive, it wasn't something

20   that I looked into, addictiveness.  My

21   understanding was it was something that was a

22   habit; it was hard for some people to quit and not

23   for others.  I had personal experience where people

24   around me had quit smoking.  Some found it

25   difficult, some didn't find it particularly

to

1     difficult.

2             But in terms of addiction, I don't know

3   that I thought about it in that way at that time.

4   I think that smoking was perceived  even by the

5   American Medical Association and others  as a

6   habit that we had in our society.

7        Q.   Have you ever smoked cigarettes, sir?

8        A.   I have smoked a cigarette, but I have

9   never been a regular smoker.

10        Q.   You used the word "habit."  Do you still

11   believe cigarette smoking is a habit?

12        A.   I believe that nicotine in tobacco and

13   tobacco products is addictive.  I agree with our

14   company's view on that.

15             In terms of individuals my understanding

16   is that, for example, according to the DSM-IV

17   classification, maybe 50 percent of smokers would

18   be considered dependent.  Again, I think it goes to

19   the fact that for some individuals it can be quite

20   difficult to quit, for others not as difficult to

21   quit.  There are tens of millions of people that

22   have quit smoking; more former smokers than current

23   ones.  For many of those I think it was difficult;

24   for others, not as difficult.

25        Q.   I appreciate your answer, sir, but my

Page 44

1   question was, do you still take a position that

2   smoking is a habit?

3        A.   I believe I answered the question in my

4   previous answer.  I agree with our company's view,

5   the view that nicotine in tobacco and tobacco

6   products, in smoke is addictive.  That being said,

7   my understanding of the scientific data would be

8   that not all smokers are dependent.

9        Q.  Now, you said that Mrs. Cohen was a

10   stakeholder, and as such she was one who had an

11   interest in the company and the company had an

12   interest in her, correct?

13        A.   Yes.  I don't know that I said "she"

14   specifically, but smokers in general, and she was a

15   smoker; so yes, as part of that group, she would

16   be.

17        Q.   How did Mrs. Cohen's stake in RJR compare

18   with that of a shareholder?

19        A.   Mrs. Cohen, my understanding is that she

20   was a smoker, so she was someone that purchased and

21   consumed cigarettes.  I don't know if she was a

22   shareholder or not within our company.  I don't

23   have anything information about that one way or the

24   other.  But shareholders would be ones that

25   actually trade in stock for the company.

1        Q.   And with regard to the company, whose

2   interests are more important, that of a stakeholder

3   or that of a shareholder?

4             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

5        A.   I don't know that I can say either is

6   more important than the other.  I think they're

7   both important.

8   BY MR. HAMMER:

9        Q.   Is it important for a company to provide

10   information to their stakeholders?

11        A.   I think that communication is an

12   important thing, that various types of information

13   should be communicated in an appropriate forum.

14   So, for example, complex science should be

15   communicated in a scientific forum.  But, yes, I

16   think that there should be communication.

17        Q.   Is it important for a company such as RJR

18   to share information with its stakeholders?

19        A.   I think, again, it's hard to answer that

20   open-ended question.  It would depend upon what

21   type of information we're talking about.  I think

22   that as far as our views today, they're provided in

23   our guiding principles and beliefs on our website.

24   This is one example of the way that we communicate.

25             In terms of our science, it would be

5        Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds withhold information

6   from smokers like Mrs. Cohen in the years 1940 when

7   she started smoking through the year 1990?

8             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9        A.   I don't believe so, no.

11        Q.   And your opinion then is that

12   R.J. Reynolds did not withhold information from

13   smokers throughout the years of 1940 to 1990?

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

15   It's been asked and answered.

16        A.   I believe my last answer was responsive.

17   I believe that Reynolds has always put its views

18   forward in a straightforward way depending upon

19   what type of information it is.

21        Q.   Have you gone through the -- what's known

4   documents.  I haven't read each and every one of

5   those, no.  I have read many documents over the

6   course of my career.

7        Q.   Have you reviewed the various

8   advertisements that R.J. Reynolds had throughout

9   the years from 1940 through -- into the '60s --

10   '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s?

11        A.   No.  I've not worked in the advertising

12   department.  I'm in the research and development

13   department.  Actually, first research; and then

14   after it merged, the research and development

15   department.

16             So throughout my career, my focus has

17   been on research and research and development, not

18   advertising.  I'm aware of some advertising, but

19   I've not gone and tried to review all of the

6
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7
	A.   In terms of "always," that would be

8
	forever in time backwards, so I think the answer

9
	would be no.  I think that in terms of Reynolds'

10
	understanding of COPD and all smoking-related

11
	diseases, they've evolved over time.  There have

12
	been different types of studies conducted,           j

13
	different types of science; and throughout the        \

14
	years as more information has been available,        \

15
	Reynolds' views have evolved.                      |

	BY MR. HAMMER:

17
	Q.  As far as your understanding, when did

	R.J. Reynolds acknowledge that smoking causes COPD?

19
	A.  I don't know that there's an exact date.    \

20
	I'm not aware of a single date.  I think that

21
	probably scientists within the company, as they

22
	learned more about the types of data that were

23
	emerging, formed views over time; but I'm not aware

24
	of any specific single date in which that occurred.

25       Q.   When did R.J. Reynolds publicly
	
United Reporting, Inc

954-525-2221

Page 49

1   acknowledge that smoking causes COPD?

2        A.   I think that Reynolds has acknowledged

3   for many decades that there were risks associated

4   with smoking, and those included COPD.

5             As far as indicating that cigarette

6   smoking could cause COPD in some individuals or

7   causes COPD, I believe that may have been in the

8   late '90s or around the year 2000.

9        Q.   What is your understanding of when RJR

10   publicly acknowledged that cigarette smoking causes

11   lung cancer?

12        A.   That would be much like my previous

13   answer that I just provided.

14             As far as the risks associated with

15   smoking, including lung cancer, I think that

16   Reynolds has not disputed that there's the risk

17   associated with lung cancer for many years.  I

18   think as far as stating that smoking causes lung

19   cancer in some individuals or smoking causes lung

20   cancer, that would have been in the late 1990s to

21   the very early 2000s.

22        Q.   What can you point us to that indicates

23   that RJR publicly acknowledged that cigarette

24   smoking causes lung cancer prior to what you

25   described as late 1990 to 2000?

1        A.   As far as acknowledging the possibility,

2   the fact that there was risk, I think all of the

3   research that's been conducted, all of the new

4   products that have been developed and introduced

5   generally over the many years, all suggest that

6   publicly.

7             I think as far as the statement on our

8   website, for example, that would have been, as I

9   said, in the late 1990s, around the year 2000, or

10   perhaps a year or two later.

11        Q.   Okay.  My question though, sir, is can

12   you point to anything in particular that indicates

13   that RJR publicly acknowledged that smoking causes

14   lung cancer prior to 1999, 2000?

15        A.  As I indicated just a moment ago, I

16   believe that all of our efforts are a public

17   acknowledgement of the risk, the possibility that

18   smoking causes lung cancer.

19             I think as far as concluding that and

20   making the statement that smoking causes lung

21   cancer, that happened in the time frame that I've

22   indicated in the previous answers.

23        Q.   When Mrs. Cohen was diagnosed with COPD

24   in the early '90s, did RJR acknowledge that

25   cigarettes cause COPD publicly?  Did they publicly

2
	A.   I'm not sure exactly what you mean by

3
	"publicly acknowledge."  If you mean was it on a

4
	website at that point in time; no, it was not.

5
	I think in terms of acknowledging the

6
	risks and producing products that are intended to

7
	reduce exposures and risk, Reynolds has been

8
	working for many years in that regard and those

9
	products were provided publicly.

10
	Q.   Did RJR ever come out and tell the public

11
	that COPD causes lung cancer  I'm sorry, that

12
	cigarette smoking causes -- strike that.              \

	Did R.J. Reynolds, prior to putting it on   |

1   of the first paragraph under the "Area of

3   BY MR. HAMMER:

4        Q.   Sure.  Area of expertise.  Right about

5   the fifth  sixth line down it says, "General

6   cigarette design and product development."

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   Okay.  So you're prepared to talk about

9   the general cigarette design and product

10   development?

11        A.   Yes, I am.

12        Q.   So have you researched the beginning of

13   cigarettes and how they came to be?

14        A.   I'm not sure what you mean by "the

15   beginning."  I have a very good understanding of

16   the various cigarette designs and the type of

17   research and the development that's gone on in your

18   company over the years.

19             So in terms of cigarettes specifically,

20   the product development process, I understand the

21   technologies that have been implemented into new

22   cigarette designs, I understand the reasons that

23   they've been implemented.  I can speak about all of

24   those things, if you would like.

25             But as far as cigarettes themselves, the

1   history of cigarettes, I'm not sure exactly what

2   you're referring to as far as the timeline.

3        Q.  As far as the design of the cigarette,

4   would you agree that the cigarette is designed in

5   such a way to provide nicotine to the smoker?

6        A.  No.  I wouldn't agree with that

7   characterization.

8        Q.   Have you ever heard the term that "the

9   cigarette is the perfect nicotine delivery device"?

10        A.   I may have heard that along the way, yes.

11        Q.   Do you agree or disagree with that?

12        A.   I'm not sure exactly what it means.  From

13   my understanding, my understanding of cigarette

14   designs and the cigarettes in the marketplace and

15   so on, cigarettes contain tobacco, tobacco contains

16   nicotine.  It takes a certain amount of tobacco to

17   form the rod, the tobacco rod that's the cigarette.

18   The cigarette may or may not have a filter on the

19   end.  Most do.

20             In terms of that tobacco rod, by virtue

21   of the amount of tobacco that's required to form

22   it, there will be a range of nicotine in cigarettes

23   that's based on the amount of nicotine that's in

24   tobacco in the field.  And when people smoke

25   cigarettes -- I've done work myself, published work

1   on the fate of nicotine, for example -- most of the

2   nicotine in the cigarette either ends up in

3   sidestream smoke, in the filter, it ends up

4   decomposing.  So a very small amount of nicotine

5   that's in the cigarette is something that people

6   would actually puff out of a cigarette.  When they

7   do puff on a cigarette, the amount of smoke that

8   they puff out of the cigarette various potentially

9   from puff to puff, from cigarette to cigarette,

10   from person to person, from day to day.

11             So it depends upon how they choose to

12   smoke a cigarette, as far as what they're puffing

13   out of it.  So I'm not sure what the term that you

14   referred to would mean exactly.

15        Q.   In your research and development of the

16   cigarette for R.J., have you discovered that people

17   don't smoke cigarettes if they don't have nicotine

18   in them?

19        A.   What we've found is that when there have

20   been cigarettes that have been produced with

21   greatly reduced amounts of nicotine, smokers don't

22   tend to prefer those cigarettes.  But similarly

23   when we've produced cigarettes that have normal

24   amounts, that is typical amounts of nicotine

25   yielded but have greatly reduced amounts of tar,

12
	Q.   Now, sir, the last trial that you           j

13
	testified in, would that have been the Callaway       j

14
	trial?

15
	A.   No.  The last trial I testified in was

16
	the trial I indicated earlier.  Schlenther would be

17
	the name of the trial.                                j

18
	Q.   And when was that trial held?              j

19
	A.   That trial was in September of this year.

20
	Q.   But you don't recall where that trial was

21
	held?

22
	A.   I'm not good with the counties in

23
	Florida.  Alachua, perhaps, may have been the name

24
	of it.  It's not a name I know right off.

25
	Q.   Okay.  Now, I asked you earlier about the   |

shares of stock that you have, and you said you

shares.  I asked about the fact that you

have

had testified previously that you had shares, and then I asked you if you've ever sold any of your shares.  Have you ever sold any of your shares, sir?

A.   In terms of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, over the years R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has had a number of different I think legal entities.  I don't recall that I did; but I may have owned some shares prior, for example, to the leverage buyout that occurred many years ago, in which case those would have had to have been tendered.

Also, as the company progressed into different forms, I may have sold some along the way or there may have been some that were part of mutual funds.  But in terms of any recent years, I've not sold any shares.

Q.   And so when's the last time that you

actually checked to confirm that you own

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED shares?

A.   Several months ago.

Q.   Was that before or after the last trial

you testified in?                                                                                     %     ^

A.   I believe it probably would have been before that trial.

Q.   So at that trial if you were asked how

many shares you owned, you would have said

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED shares?

A.   I would have given my best understanding

I think it would have been about

Q.   Now, in the Callaway trial, you said that you actually had sold shares of your stock.

A.   Again, in any recent years I've not sold any shares.  Again, there may have been times in years past, sometime back when the company changed its legal entity a couple of times along the way where I did or I may have as part of mutual funds. But in referring to recent years and in terms of the

shares, I've not sold any of that.

Q.   Now, as a shareholder in RJR you don't want to see their stock price go down, do you?

A.   As a shareholder in RJR, first of all, what I want to see is that we transform tobacco.  I want to see that the company continues to look for innovative ways to develop products that will appeal to cigarette smokers and will reduce the risks of smoking.  So that's the first and foremost

1   thing I want as a shareholder.

2             In terms of the share price, I accept

3   that it goes up and down based upon the market,

4   that there are many things that can affect that.

5   That they can be the fiscal cliff that's in the

7   generally I would like to see the shares remain the

8   same or go up and not go down.

9        Q.   Would you agree that significant jury

10   verdicts against R.J. Reynolds would cause the

11   stock price to go down?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   I don't know.  I think that there are

14   many factors that affect the market, in terms of

15   people trading in stocks and securities.  That's

16   one factor that I think may affect some

17   individuals.  I don't know that it will have an

18   effect one way or the other.

20        Q.   Do you have a preference as to whether

21   R.J. Reynolds receives a favorable verdict in this

	consider
	all if the facts and render a verdict.  I

13
	would be
	pleased if that was a favorable verdict,

14
	but what
	I would expect is that the jury will        \

	consider
	all of the facts and they will research

16
	their conclusion.

	In this case, sir, if the facts are that

	Mrs. Cohen was addicted to the nicotine in

	cigarettes and that addiction caused her to smoke
	
21
	enough ci

	for this

	No, not per se, in that I don't consider

20

1   at work.  I still have to perform my duties.  I end

2   up doing those on times that are not scheduled work

3   time as such.  So I end up doing those in the

4   evening, on the weekend; and I suspect through the

5   remainder of the year, while I'm technically on

6   vacation, I will be doing some of it then because

7   I've spent time both preparing for the hours that

8   we've discussed and for the time here today.

9             So much like other business travel or

10   other business activities, anytime I'm away from

11   the office it doesn't relieve me of having to

12   actually do that type of work.  I just have to do

13   it at a different point in time.  This is an

14   activity where I'm away from the office; it's an

15   activity that I'm not required to do; it's an

16   activity that if I did not do it I would still

17   receive the same compensation, and yet because of

18   that, receiving the same compensation, I'm not

19   relieved of any duties at the office.

1        A.   My office would be probably about three

2   to four miles from here.

3        Q.   Okay.  If you're not in your office at

4   RJR and not doing work for RJR, is that considered

5   time away from the office that you otherwise

6   wouldn't be getting paid for?

7        A.   I'm not sure I follow the question.  If

8   I'm not in the office -- let me begin again.

9             First of all, there are times where we

10   work remotely or we have work-related activities

11   outside of the office.  So, for example, if I were

12   to go to a scientific conference, that's something

13   that would be part of work-related activities.

14             In terms of this particular activity,

15   it's not something that's required of me in terms

16   of my job description, in terms of how I'm

17   evaluated in terms of my performance, this is

18   something that I have chosen to do because I think

19   it's a very important matter.

20        Q.  Why do you think it's a very important

21   matter, sir?

22        A.   I think it's a very important matter

23   because the whole subject area of tobacco and

24   tobacco products is quite scientifically complex.

1        Q.   And as far as your understanding, when is

2   it that RJR did away with their corporate jet?

3        A.   I don't know the answer to that question.

4        Q.   Now, you said that it's your

5   understanding based upon a review of the documents

6   that you reviewed in this case that Mrs. Cohen

7   started smoking in 1940 and started with Camel

8   cigarettes, correct?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   At that time when she started smoking in

11   1940 she was 16 years old, correct?

12        A.   That's my understanding.  She would have

13   been 16 years old, thereabouts, yes.

14        Q.  What is your understanding of

15   R.J. Reynolds' position with regard to 16-year-olds

16   smoking in 1940?

17             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

18   Assumes facts not in evidence, no foundation.

19        A.   In all the time that I've worked for

20   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company the policy has been

21   quite clear.  We don't want anyone under age to use

22   our products, we don't want people to buy products

23   for someone under age, we don't want anyone under

24   age smoking.

25             In terms of 1940, I don't know what the

	prevailing views would have been at that point in     I

2
	time.  What I do know as having grown up in the

3
	1960s and 1970s, for various states around the U.S.

4
	the age for smoking  the legal age to smoke

5
	varied from state to state; but in many states was    [

6
	quite a few years younger than it is today.  So

	that's evolved within our society over time.  As a

8
	society, as a company we don't want people under      j

9
	age to smoke, we don't want them to try to buy the

10
	products.  We support penalties for that sort of      j

11
	thing.  But in 1940, I don't know the exact           \

12
	situation at that point in time.

13
	Q.   Have you reviewed any of the documents

14
	from the 1940s that RJR has in their archives and     f

15
	in the internal documents that have been revealed?    \

17
	ahead.                                         ;

18
	A.   I'm not aware of any documents that speak

19
	to your question.  What I am aware of is there's

20
	been a long-standing policy to not market products

21
	to the youth, that cigarettes should not be used by

22
	anyone under age.  It's been that way the entire

23
	time I've worked with the company.

Page 68

1   is your understanding of how long that policy has

2   been in force?

3        A.   I don't know the year that it would have

4   been stated as a policy as such.  I know that at

5   least in the 1960s it was formalized in certain

6   ways.  But prior to that, I'm not suggesting it

7   wasn't the view; it just might not have been stated

8   in that same way.

9        Q.   Are you familiar with the documents of

10   R.J. Reynolds that refers to the youth market?

11             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

12        A.   I'm not sure what documents you're

13   referring to.

18             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

19        A.   I've seen some documents, I think

20   generally in the context of litigation, that have

21   had different ranges for defining that.  I think

22   some of those are government documents, some in

23   which there have been surveys.  I think even in

24   reviewing some of the documents on my reliance list

2   about smoking and really about where people were

3   adults.

4             But I've seen documents that have

5   characterized that range differently from one

6   document to the next.                                                                       \

11        A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.

13        Q.   Have they considered 13-year-olds,

15             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

16        A.   Again, I don't know a specific age.  It's   f

17   quite possible in years past that in some states in   f

18   the U.S. that it was legal for someone to smoke       |

19   cigarettes at the age of 15.  I'm not sure one way

20   or the other.                                                                                        f

1   itself.  I'm not sure one way or the other.  But I

2   think it's possible that some states in the past it

3   may have been legal for people to smoke at 15,

4   definitely at 16.  I don't know the history of each

5   of the states and their laws.  But what I do know

6   is within society perception's changed over many

7   years in quite a variety of ways.

8             With regards to smoking, it's our

9   company's view that it's something that should only

10   be considered by adults.  We don't want youth to

11   smoke.

12        Q.   And when you use the term "youth," what

13   do you call youth?

14        A.   We don't want anyone that is not of legal

15   age, we don't want anyone that is under 18 years of

16   age.  And, in fact, generally everything that we do

17   is focused on 21 years of age and above.

18        Q.   In your role in research and development,

19   you were involved in developing flavored

20   cigarettes, weren't you, sir?

21        A.   No.  I've never been a product developer.

22   I haven't been involved as a product developer.

23   I've always been a scientist involved in evaluating

24   products.  The bulk of my career has been focused

25   on evaluating products that have the potential to

2        Q.   In the years that you've been with RJR

3   are you familiar with marketing directed to the

4   youth market?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   No.  Again, as I've indicated in an

7   earlier answer, throughout my entire career there's

8   been a very clear policy; and I'm not aware of

9   anyone ever having done that.  So it's something

10   that our company does not permit.  It's not

11   something that I've ever seen happen.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   Are you aware of RJR marketing to

14   nonsmokers?

15        A.   No.  It's our policy and our view that

16   we're not going to market to nonsmokers, that what

17   we want to do is compete for adult smokers.  So

18   it's something that's highly competitive, it's

19   something that is not focused on those that don't

20   use cigarettes or tobacco products, and it's not

21   focused on youth.

22        Q.   Are you familiar with an individual by

23   the name of Claude Teague?

24        A.   I am, yes.

25        Q.   In fact, when you started with the

1   company Claude Teague was still part of

2   R.J. Reynolds, correct?

3        A.   Yes.  Dr. Teague was still with

4   R.J. Reynolds at that time.  Ultimately, I think he

5   was in the technical services area.

6        Q.   And you've actually worked with

7   Claude Teague in the past, haven't you?

8        A.   No.  I know of Dr. Teague, but I've never

9   done any research with him.  I've never worked on

10   any projects with him as such.

11        Q.   Are you familiar with any of the work

12   that Claude Teague did for R.J. Reynolds?

13        A.   I'm not aware actually of any particular

14   research that he's conducted.  What I am aware of

15   is certain documents that he's generated along the

16   way through my litigation interactions.

17             But as far as being a researcher, he's

18   not someone that I look to in terms of the history

19   of the department and think of him as someone

20   that's actually contributed a lot to the research

21   findings.

22             I'm sorry.  I'm getting feedback of some

23   kind here.  Must be on 

24        Q.   Are you still getting it?

25        A.   No.  It must have been your shuffling.

3
	A.   In terms of 1953, yes.  He did a -- I'm

	not sure specifically which one you're referring

5
	to, but he did do a review of cancer research in

	that year.

7
	Q.   And have you read that?

8
	A.   I have read that document, yes.

	A.   I believe that it is, yes.

16
	A.   No.  That wouldn't be correct in that he

17

	of research that had been reported in the             1

9
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10
	A.   Again, I believe in terms of my earlier

11
	answer, I've been quite clear.  My understanding is   \

12
	that Reynolds has always had a policy to not market   !

13
	to youth.  And so as far as that policy, it's never   \

14
	targeted -- if that was your word, I'm not sure

4   promotion at the beginning smoker?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   I would not be surprised that individuals

7   have a different range of thoughts or views.  What

8   I would be surprised by would be if the company had

9   acted upon such a view.

10   BY MR. HAMMER:

11        Q.   What does the term "presmoker" mean?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   Again, in the context of the document

14   you're looking at, I'm not sure.  Taken just as a

15   word, "pre" would mean before.

16   BY MR. HAMMER:

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3        A.   Again, I'm not exactly sure what that

4   means, but I perceive that to be someone that's not

5   a smoker; and also it's someone that at any age

6   could be a presmoker.  But it's been our

7   long-standing policy not to market to youth and to

8   compete for adult smokers.

10        Q.  Well, based upon your review of the

11   history of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, have you

22        A.   I'm not aware of that at R.J. Reynolds as

23   far as any type of a research effort, and I don't

24   know the history at B&W in that regard.

3   BY MR. GDANSKI:

4        Q.   Well, has R.J. Reynolds added flavors to

5   their cigarettes to make them sweet?

6        A.   No.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has

7   added flavors, additives and ingredients, flavors,

8   as such to cigarettes to help distinguish the taste

9   of one brand from another.  I don't know that

10   smokers generally would ever suggest that cigarette

11   smoke is sweet.  I think that depending upon the

12   flavors that may be present, there's a different

13   taste signature, a different way in which one

14   product tastes from another.  That's how brands are

15   distinguished.  But they're not, in my

16   understanding, sweet.

4        Q.   You're not sure of the Joe  I mean,

5   you were there throughout the entirety of the

6   Joe Camel campaign, correct?

7        A.   I was, yes.

8        Q.   And as you sit here today it's your

9   testimony you're not sure as to whether or not that

10   was a successful ad campaign?

11             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

12   It's been asked and answered.

13        A.   Again, as I indicated in my previous

14   answer, I don't work in the marketing department.

15   I don't know if it was considered successful or

16   not.  I know that it was something that ran for a

17   period of time, that it was focused on adult

18   smokers.  There was a lot of competition for adult

19   smokers, and ultimately it was a campaign that had

20   a finite period of time; and things have happened

21   since to try to advertise to adult smokers after

22   that campaign.

23             I don't know if it was judged a success

24   or not by the marketing department.

1        Q.   Are you aware that Camel's share of the

2   under-18 market jumped from almost nothing to

3   33 percent in just three years as a result of the

4   Joe Camel campaign?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   I've not read any information in that

7   regard, so I don't have an opinion about that one

8   way or the other.

13   been revealed over the years?

14        A.   I know there are such books; but no, I've

15   not read those.

16        Q.   Have you heard of a book called the

17   Golden Holocaust?

18        A.   I have heard of it, yes.

22        Q.  But you haven't read any of those books?

2             In addition, my focus is on the

3   experiences that I've had at the company, the

4   efforts that we've done to reduce the risks

5   associated with smoking.  So I know what's going on

6   with the company.  I don't need to read a book of

7   someone else's interpretation of it.

8        Q.   Are you aware of the study that was done

9   by the Medical College of Georgia in 1991 that

10   found that by the age of 6 over 90 percent of

11   American kids were able to recognize the Joe Camel

12   character?

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.   I'm not aware of that particular study.

15   I know that there was a lot of research done in

16   those general areas in that time frame, but I don't

17   know that particular study, no.

18   BY MR. HAMMER:

19        Q.  Would you agree that if by the age of 6

20   over 90 percent of the American kids were able to

21   recognize the Joe Camel character that it would

22   indicate that the Joe Camel campaign was very

23   successful?

24             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

25   It's argumentative and speculative.

1        A.   No, I would not agree.  I don't know what

2   criteria I would put forward, in that I don't

3   generally evaluate such campaigns.

4             But what I can tell you is that during my

5   time at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company it's been our

6   policy not to advertise to youth.  I don't think

7   that anything that would suggest that we were doing

8   that would be something we wanted.  We wanted to

9   compete for adult smokers.  We don't want to

10   advertise to youth.

11   BY MR. HAMMER:

12        Q.   Cartoon characters such as Joe Camel,

13   those aren't designed for the kids?

14        A.   My understanding of the campaign is

15   that  again, I'm not in marketing, but my

16   understanding is they were advertisements that had

17   a person that looked like Joe Camel because the

18   brand was a Camel brand and that they were intended

19   to appeal to adults, to be irreverent in some way

20   to advertise to them in terms of that product.

21   They were not intended for youth.

1   what do you mean by that, sir?

2        A.   Something that provided the predominant

3   flavor.  That's however the FDA would choose to

4   define it.  But their requirement is that there not

5   be any products with characterizing flavors.  If

6   there are, I expect that we will hear from them.

7        Q.   Meaning the predominant flavor, but you

8   could still use flavors in the cigarette, can't

9   you?

10        A.   Again, you can use additives, flavors to

11   distinguish the taste signature from one brand to

12   another.  Those flavors would accentuate things

13   that are naturally present in tobacco and smoke,

14   but they would help distinguish one from another

15   much like the taste between say Coca-Cola and

16   Pepsi.  They're both cola beverages but they taste

17   different.

18        Q.   And to this day R.J. Reynolds still uses

19   such flavors in their tobacco, in their cigarettes,

20   correct?

21             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

22        A.   Again, as I indicated in a series of

23   answers a few moments ago, we have additives and

24   ingredients.  Those aren't used in all of our

25   cigarettes brands.  The ones that you were

to United Reporting, Inc                                                                                     CO

1   referring to I think generally are all on that list

2   and may be added to some cigarette brands.  They

3   would not be added in the amounts to which they're

4   characterizing.  They would be added in amounts

5   that would help distinguish on a subtle basis one

6   taste signature from another.

7        Q.   Sir, I asked you earlier about whether

8   RJR adds honey to their cigarettes, and you said I

9   believe they do.

10        A.   Again, as I've indicated, I don't have

11   the list memorized.  It's not here in front of me.

12   I think that's possible, but I don't know as I sit

13   here that they do or they not.  I think it's

14   possible to some brands honey may be added.

15        Q.  Well, isn't it true, sir, that you've

16   personally been involved in work at RJR in which

17   honey was used as an additive?

18        A.   I've been involved in work in which the

19   material was assessed in terms of our product

20   stewardship process, and so data were generated on

21   products with and without honey being added.  And

22   the toxicology, the chemistry, and so on of those

23   products were evaluated to make sure that there was

24   no change in the inherent profile of the product

25   with or without that material being present; so, in

5

7

11

6        Q.   Sir, prior to the litigation beginning 

7   I guess R.J. Reynolds, as well as the other tobacco   f

8   companies, but let's talk about R.J. Reynolds.

9             Prior to the litigation commencing                       J

10   against R.J. Reynolds, did Reynolds produce any of

11   these documents that are part of the Legacy?                       \

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   I would have to review each and every one

14   to answer completely, but I expect there are

15   documents there that are scientific publications      f

16   that were out in the scientific literature.                         \

17   There's a wide range of documents.  So I think for

18   many of them the answer may well be yes.  I would

19   need to review them to be able to answer your

20   question completely.

23   would it surprise you to learn that when you put

24   your name in and the term "honey," that it comes up

3             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

4        A.   I don't know that it would surprise me or

5   not.  I know that when you type in my name you get

6   many hits for many different search words.

7   Anything that was copied to anyone, any

8   distribution list, my name would be then on that

9   search as such.

10             So as far as the number that you just

11   indicated, that many different studies, yes, that

12   would surprise me.  I wasn't involved in that

13   number of studies.

14   BY MR. HAMMER:

15        Q.   Sir, are you familiar with whether or not

16   R.J. Reynolds ever sold berry-flavored cigarettes?

17        A.   I don't know right off that there was a

18   product with a berry-flavored name or not.  I know

19   that we've had some Camel products for a number of

20   years that had different flavor signatures,

21   different taste signatures, that adult consumers

22   said they were interested in.  It's possible that

23   one of those may have been termed a berry-type of

24   flavor.

2        A.   Again, I don't have the brand names from

3   that point in time memorized.  If you're referring

4   to a specific brand, I'll try to answer the

5   question.

6             Again, I think there was a period of time

7   that there were several Camel brand styles that

8   were developed based on the input from adult

9   smokers that said, much like other products at that

10   time that had different flavors, they were

11   interested in a break from their usual brand and

12   wanted some other kind of taste signature or

13   flavor.  It was during a period of time where there

14   were many different flavored products; things like

15   flavored vodkas and other things.  I don't know

16   right off that list.  That may well be one.

17        Q.   How about toffee-flavored cigarettes?

18        A.   My answer would be the same.

19        Q.   And you're familiar that RJR sold mocha

20   mint-flavored cigarettes?

21        A.   Again, I think that that may have been a

22   possibility for the group of products that I'm

23   referring to.  I don't have memorized the specific

24   brand styles.

Page 97

1        A.   My answer would be the same.

2        Q.   Well, those cigarettes, berry-flavored,

3   toffee-flavored, mocha mint-flavored,

4   cinnamon-flavored, pineapple coconut-flavored,

5   those are flavored cigarettes designed to appeal

6   particularly to the youth.  Isn't that true, sir?

7             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

8        A.   No, that would not be true.  The products

9   that I believe you're speaking about were developed

10   based upon the input of adult smokers, as I

11   indicated in an earlier answer.  My understanding

12   is that they never achieved much of a market

13   share  perhaps less than one-tenth of one

14   percent  and that they were discontinued based

15   upon some of the general controversy around having

16   characterizing flavors.

17             So while the company was developing a

18   policy in that direction, they chose at some point

19   to extend that to all products; and prior to the

20   FDA, do away with any products that had any type of

21   characterizing flavor.

22             But, no I'm not aware.  In fact, just the

23   opposite, that they were intended for anything but

24   adult smokers.

1        Q.   You mentioned that RJR discontinued the

2   production of those cigarettes, correct?

3        A.   That's correct, yes.

4        Q.   They didn't do that voluntarily though,

5   did they, sir?

6        A.   I believe it was a voluntary agreement,

7   that they were not forced to do that; but they were

8   in discussions around the concept of characterizing

9   flavors.  There's a press release I think that was

10   issued, if I recall correctly, about 2006 that

11   would summarize that.

12        Q.   In fact, they stopped marketing fruit-

13   and candy-flavored cigarettes in 2006, correct?

14        A.   I believe that's correct, yes.  Anything

15   with a name -- I'm sorry.  Anything with a name

16   that would have suggested a flavor or anything that

17   had a predominant flavor.

18        Q.   And that was as a result of the FDA

19   determining that those flavored cigarettes were

20   targeted to the youth, correct, sir?

21             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

22        A.   No.  That's not true at all.  I don't

23   believe the FDA had any role in the decision at

24   all.  I believe the press release from that time

25   frame speaks for itself.

	A.   No.                                      |

20
	Q.   You know who Barbie is, right?

21
	A.   I believe I do.  I believe  I believe I

22
	understand what you're referring to.

23
	Q.   Okay.  What do you understand Barbie to

24
	be?

25       A.   Well, I'm assuming that you're referring

to

	to the
	doll, the Barbie doll.

2
	Q.
	The Barbie doll                        j

3
	A.
	Is that                               1

4
	Q.
	Sure.  The Barbie doll that young girls     j

5
	play wi
	th.                                         !

6
	A.
	Again, I'm not here to decide who plays

7
	with Ba
	rbie.  I know that many young girls at times   [

8
	have pi
	ayed with Barbie in years past; but that's     \

9
	not to
	suggest that there may not be others, young

10
	men, that choose to play with Barbie too.
	
11
	Q.
	Do you have kids, sir?

12
	A.
	I do.  Grown children.                     j

13
	Q.
	When your kids were kids -- do you have

14
	girls?
	

15
	A.
	I do, yes.                                 i

16
	Q.
	How many?

17
	A.
	I have three.

18
	Q.
	And when they were young children, did

19
	you buy
	them Barbie dolls?                            \

20
	A.
	I don't recall that we bought Barbie

21
	dolls.
	I think Cabbage Patch was quite popular in

22
	their youth.  There was a number of different
	
23
	things.
	I think Barbies generally would have been

24
	popular
	more at the time that I was quite young.

25       Q.   Sir, as far as the Barbie dolls played

	Page 103 \

1
	with by young girls, meaning 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-,

2
	10-years-olds, correct?

3
	A.  Again, I don't know all the facts around

4
	who purchases or is interested in Barbie.  I know

5
	that when I was young, when I was those ages, girls

6
	at that time would have, yes, been interested in

7
	Barbie more than not.

8
	Q.  Even into the teen years, correct?

9
	A.   I think some, yes.                        \

10
	Q.   Do adults play with Barbie dolls, sir?      j

11
	A.   Again, sir, with all due respect, I'm not   J

12
	an expert in the area of Barbie or Barbie dolls.      \

13
	I'm not here to offer opinions about the Barbie       \

14
	doll.  You would need to ask someone else about the   [

15
	wide range of individuals that may or may not use

16
	Barbie.

17
	Q.   Okay.  The Camel No. 9 packaging, it

18
	featured flowery pink and teal borders, right?

19
	A.   My understanding is there were a few

20
	different ads; and that some of those were

21
	generally black, some may have had pink.  There

22
	were different  a limited number of different

23
	advertisements.

24
	Q.   And the filter of the Camel No. 9 had a

25
	hot pink stripe around the filter with a silhouette

Page 104 I

1   of a hot pink camel, correct?

2        A.   That's possible.  I don't recall exactly.   \

3   I think it would have had pink in the tipping.  It

4   might have well had the camel there.

5        Q.   And the ads for Camel No. 9 features        I

6   flowers on the ads, correct?

7        A.   Again, there were several different ads.

8   They had various designs.  I don't have them here

9   with me.  My recollection is that like much like

10   all advertising, there would have been a variety of   \

11   graphical presentations in several different                       |

12   colors.

13        Q.   They used the color pink throughout the

14   ads, correct?

15        A.   I don't know if it was in all of them.  I   l

16   know it was in some, yes.

17        Q.  Used the word "luscious" in the ads,

18   right?

19        A.   I believe so, yes.  That may have been

20   part of the ad, at least some of them.

21        Q.   And the ads ran in popular fashion

22   magazines, including InStyle, right?

23        A.   I don't know all of the various places

24   where it may have ran.  I think it was a limited

i      cn co

25   number of magazines.  As with our advertising                            <s>

United Reporting, Inc                                                                                   03

1   policy at the time, all of those would have been

2   adult-themed magazines.  They would have been

3   magazines in which there was data available to show

4   that at least 85 percent of the readership or more

5   was 18 years of age and above and that the themes

6   were adult-oriented.  So they would have been

7   magazines focused on adults.

8        Q.   Magazines such as InStyle, Cosmopolitan,

9   Elle, Marie Claire, Vogue, and Lucky.  Those were

10   all magazines that Camel No. 9 ran in, correct,

11   sir?

12        A.   I don't know if it was in each and every

13   one of those; but some of those, yes.

14        Q.   And there were promotional giveaways with

15   Camel No. 9 cigarettes, weren't there, sir?

16        A.   No.  There were not generally any

17   promotional giveaways.

18        Q.   There were promotional giveaways

19   associated with Camel 9 at some point, correct?

20        A.   The only thing I'm aware of in that

21   regard is there were a very limited 21 year and

22   above adult venue events in the Northwest of the

23   U.S.  I believe they were in Oregon.  And there

24   were certain promotional items in that event.

25   Those events  I've seen the advertisement for the

	event, and recall that it says very clearly "21
	
2
	years and
	above" and that it was age-verified.

3
	There was
	no one under the age of 21 there.  That     [

4
	being said, there were some promotional items at
	
5
	that event, is my understanding.
	
6
	Q.
	And some of items that were given out as

7
	promotional items were berry-flavored lip balm,
	
8
	correct?
	

9
	A.
	I've seen that reported.  I believe

10
	that's possible, yes.
	
11
	Q.
	Cellphone jewelry, correct?

12
	A.
	I believe so, yes.

13
	Q.
	Beaded lighters, correct?                  \

14
	A.
	I believe that's true, yes.

15
	Q.
	And novelty pink and black purses,

16
	correct?
	i

17
	A.
	I don't recall having seen that, but it's

18
	possible.
	

19
	Q.
	Items such as lip balm and cellphone        I

20
	jewelry and beaded lighters and novelty pink and
	
21
	black purses are targeting teenage girls, aren't
	
22
	they, sir
	?

23
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

24
	A.
	As I've indicated in my answer, this was

25  at a very
		limited number of events for 21 years of

United Reporting, Inc

1   age and above.  By virtue of no teenagers being

2   present at the event, my answer is no, that they

3   were not targeting anyone that was a teenager.

4   BY MR. HAMMER:

5        Q.   Is it your understanding then, sir, that

6   items such as berry-flavored lip balm and cellphone

7   jewelry are adult promotional items rather than

8   teenage promotional items?

9        A.   Again, I don't work in the marketing

10   department.  What I can tell you is in my review of

11   the materials that you're referring to, it's very

12   clear that it was a very limited number of events;

13   the events were for age 21 and above; it was adult

14   verified in that regard; and that if those items

15   were provided, they were provided to individuals

16   that were 21 and above.

17             I can't tell you that the individuals

18   that were there either did or did not like the

19   items, but they were not provided to individuals

20   that were under 21.

21        Q.   Are you familiar with a product called

22   Camel Crush?

23        A.   Yes, I am.

24        Q.   I'm sorry, sir.  I didn't get your

25   answer.

1
	A.   I said yes, I am.

2
	Q.   Camel Crush is a cigarette that features    f

3
	a capsule in a filter, correct, sir?

4
	A.   I'm not sure about the word "features,"

5
	but it's a product that does have a capsule in the

6
	filter, yes.

7
	Q.   Well, what does the term "crush" mean

8
	when it comes to Camel Crush?

9
	A.  The Camel Crush product, again, is a

10
	product that was developed in response to adult       j

11
	smokers.  Some adult smokers have said that from      \

12
	time to time they would like something different

13
	than their usual brand, they'd like a different

14
	experience, want something different.  So Camel

15
	Crush is something that provides a menthol flavor     [

16
	in a capsule in the filter.                        I

17
	When the filter is squeezed to crush that   I

18
	capsule, it releases the menthol flavor and the

19
	smoker at any point during smoking the cigarette      [

20
	can choose to do that and experience a different

21
	taste.

22
	Q.   The feature of the cigarette is that

23
	capsule you can crush, correct?

24
	A.   Well, the feature of the cigarette would

25  be its overall design.  It would be the length, the
	
United Reporting, Inc

954-525-2221

Page 109

1   paper that it has, the tobacco blend that it

2   contains.  One of the design features of that

3   cigarette would be the capsule.

4        Q.   And the capsule releases a menthol mint

5   flavor, correct?

6        A.   As I indicated in my earlier answer, it

7   would release menthol.  Mint is a different flavor

8   than menthol.  I don't believe that it's meant as

9   such.  I think that it's menthol.

10        Q.   And some of the slogans that have been

11   used to market the Camel Crush cigarette have been

12   "Squeeze.  Click.  Change."  Right?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   And then "Have a twosome"?

15        A.   I'm not familiar with that one.  But I

16   think, again, my impression is that would

17   communicate that you could change from the taste of

18   the cigarette without menthol to the taste of it

19   with menthol.

20        Q.   All these ads imply that using the Camel

21   Crush is a fun product to use, right?

22             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

23        A.   Again, I don't work in the marketing

24   department.  I think that it's trying to

25   communicate, based on our understanding from adult

1   smokers, indicating they'd like the opportunity to

2   have a product that would provide such an option;

3   that is, to change the taste during smoking, that

4   it does that.  As far as it being fun, it may

5   characterize it that way.

6   BY MR. HAMMER:

7        Q.   Sir, it's essentially got a piece of

8   candy in the filter, right?

9             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10        A.   That would not even be close to an

11   accurate description.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   When you bite into that capsule it

14   releases the flavor which goes through the filter,

15   correct?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   I'm not aware of anyone ever biting

18   through the filter and into the capsule.

19   BY MR. HAMMER:

20        Q.   When you squeeze the capsule with your

21   fingertips, it's designed so that when you squeeze

22   the capsule, which is inside the filter, it's

23   designed to release the flavor throughout the

24   filter, correct, sir?

25        A.   It releases it into the filter and into

1   the smoke stream.  So a smoker is smoking the

2   cigarette, at some point they may choose -- or they

3   may choose during the entire time that they're

4   smoking a cigarette never to click the filter.  But

5   when they do, it would release a menthol type of

6   flavor; and it would change the flavor of the

7   smoke.

8        Q.   The sales of Camel Crush are doing pretty

9   well, aren't they?

10        A.   I don't know the sales figures right off;

11   but I think they're doing reasonably well, yes.

12        Q.   Well, according to R.J. Reynolds'

13   quarterly report dated April 26th, 2012, they're

14   increasing, correct?

15        A.   Again, I believe they are.  I'd have to

16   look at those figures, but I believe that's true.

17        Q.   Have you ever gone on any of the websites

18   that talk about the Camel Crush cigarette?

19        A.   I'm sorry.  We're getting

14      FURTHER EXAMINATION ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

15   BY MR. HAMMER:

16        Q.  We talked briefly about some of the

17   documents that were produced by Claude Teague for

18   RJR.  And you said you're familiar with some of

19   those documents, correct?

20        A.   Yes.  Throughout -- in the context of

21   litigation, I've become familiar with at least a

22   limited number.

23        Q.   When you say "in the context of

24   litigation," does that mean you've read them after

25   they were brought out to your attention?

1
	A.   Yes.  I've been asked questions about       [

2
	some documents in prior depositions, and I've read    [

3
	through certain documents; but they were not

4
	documents that I was aware of before then.

5
	Q.   Okay.  Now, when did Claude Teague leave

6
	RJR?

7
	A.   He left RJR in the mid-1980s.

8
	Q.   Okay.  So he was there for at least five,

9
	six, seven years with you?                         [

10
	A.   Yes.

11
	Q.   And I asked you earlier whether or not

12
	you actually worked with him.  You said you never

13
	worked with Claude Teague?

14
	A.  That's correct.                          \

15
	Q.  But you did know Claude Teague and you     j

16
	came across him at RJR, correct?

17
	A.   I was aware that he was at RJR.  I mean,

18
	I was aware that there were many individuals there.

19
	My role at that time was a bench scientist.  I was

20
	developing chromatic methods and so on.  I'm not

21
	aware that Dr. Teague ever did any laboratory work

22
	as such.  He definitely didn't do any laboratory

23
	work while he was with the company and I was with

24
	the company.

25
	Q.   Did you go to any meetings where            I

1
	Claude Teague was also present?                     f

2
	A.   He may have been present if there were

3
	department-wide meetings.  I don't know.  I didn't

4
	look to see if he was or wasn't there.  I don't

5
	recall any specific meetings, small meetings, in

6
	which he and I were both present.

7
	Q.   Well, did you ever, for lack of a better

8
	term, "hang out" with Claude Teague?

9
	A.   No.

10
	Q.   So you never socialized with him in any     \

11
	way?                                                 [

12
	A.   No.                                        j

13
	Q.   Did you ever have lunch with him?           \

14
	A.   Not that I recall, no.                     |

15
	Q.   Did you ever go to any of those talks       [

16
	that he may have given while he was at RJR?          [

17
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

18
	A.   I don't recall that while I was at RJR

19
	and he was at RJR that he ever gave a talk.

20
	BY MR. HAMMER:

21
	Q.   Now, when Teague left do you know whether

22
	he left on his own or was he fired?

23
	A.   I don't know the details of him leaving

24
	the company.  It's my understanding that he chose
 :

25   to retire.  There were a number of individuals in

1
	his general bracket; that is, people with his         \

2
	length of service that were choosing to retire in

3
	and about that time.

4
	i
 Q.   In fact, there were several people that     |

5
	retired around that time, correct?

6
	A.   There were a quite a number of people

7
	that retired for most of the years that I've been     \

8
	with the company.  In part, it's driven by sort of    j

9
	their age and when they started.  But since people

10
	:
 tended to be hired in waves, there were generally

11
	groups that would be close within a few years of      \

12
	one another.

13
	Q.   Do you know whether or not Claude Teague

14
	is still alive today?

15
	A.   I believe that he is, but I don't know

16
	absolutely one way or the other.

17
	Q.   Claude Teague has a pension from RJR,

18
	correct?

19
	A.   Again, I don't know his personal

20
	financial details.  I would expect it's possible

21
	that he has a retirement.  I don't know the details

22
	of that.

23
	Q.   Well, RJR does set up retirement pensions

24
	for their employees, correct?

25
	A.   They don't set up pensions as such.  For

United Reporting, Inc

	some there could be an annuity, some a lump sum.

2
	Currently, for individuals being hired today, they

3
	would not receive either of those.  They would        \

4
	receive a certain amount of matching to their

5
	401(k).

6
	Q.   When Claude Teague retired, what was his    j

7
	role?

8
	A.   When Claude Teague retired he was leading

9
	the technical services area.                        [

10
	Q.   And certainly at that time there were       j

11
	pensions involved, correct?

12
	A.   Generally there were to the best of my      j

13
	knowledge; but again, I don't know the particular     \

14
	details of Dr. Teague.

15
	Q.   RJR, the members -- or the employees of

16
	RJR, are they -- there's a golf course up there in    \

17
	Winston-Salem, isn't there, that you-all are          \

18
	members of?

19
	A.   I'm not sure what you're referring to.

20
	There are golf courses all over North Carolina.

21
	I'm not aware that we're members as a company of

22
	any particular course.  I'm not a golfer.

23
	Q.   Are you a member of a golf club up there

24
	in Winston-Salem, sir?

25       A.   No.  As I just said, I'm not a golfer.

1
	Q.   Does RJR own a private course up there in

2
	Winston-Salem?

3
	A.   Absolutely not.  To my knowledge they've

4
	never owned a golf course.

5
	Q.   When did you start testifying on behalf

6
	of R.J. Reynolds?

7
	A.   I've provided testimony from time to time

8
	over several years.  By "testifying" do you mean at   I

9
	trial?                                           |

10
	Q.   By testifying I mean by giving any kind

11
	of testimony on behalf of R.J. Reynolds.

12
	MR. KREINER:  I'll just object to the       j

13
	form to the extent you say "on behalf of             \

14
	R.J. Reynolds," but go ahead, Doctor.

15
	A.  Yes.  In terms of testifying as it

16
	relates to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, I don't

17
	recall the exact date; but there have been various

18
	matters thought the years.  There would have been     \

19
	some matters in state courts that I testified in,

20
	provided depositions in.  So that would have been

21
	probably -- there may have been some beginning

22
	around the year 2000, but very infrequently.

23
	Q.   Well, you're here today testifying on

24
	behalf of R.J. Reynolds, aren't you?

2        Q.   Are you aware that your name appears on

3   about 25,000 Legacy documents?

4        A.   I don't know the exact number.  I know

5   that it appears on quite a number of documents.

6   I've generated and been associated with quite a bit

7   of work throughout my career.  But I also recognize

8   from having been there that if you search my name

9   it would be responsive; that is, what you would get

10   back, maybe documents that just have me copied on

13        Q.   Does R.J. Reynolds control the nicotine

14   that they have in their cigarettes?

15        A.   No.  Nicotine is not something that is a

16   specification.

17             In terms of cigarette specifications,

18   they would include a number of things; tobacco

14        A.   No.  I've been involved in many studies

15   that have nicotine as a measurement.  I've

17   nicotine.  I've been part of leading a team that

16   mid-'90s.  Isn't that true, sir?

19   time?

20        A.   Dr. Suber held various positions, but he

21   would have been a toxicologist by training.

9
	Q.   In 1994 Dr. Suber gave an interview on

10

	What I do know is we have no specification for        f

22
	challenges of the variable nature of a natural

10        Q.   I'm referring to the interview in which

11   he stated that "RJR controls the amount of nicotine

12   in each cigarette in order to provide a consistent

13   product."

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

15        A.   No.  It's not something that -- I mean,

16   if I was aware of it, it's not something that I

17   recall.  I mean, it's not something that I believe

18   I ever was aware of.

19   BY MR. HAMMER:

20        Q.   Well, in your deposition that you gave in

21   Skolnick, you said you don't agree with that

22   statement by Dr. Suber.

23        A.   That's correct.  As I just indicated a

24   moment ago, my understanding is there's never been

25   a nicotine yield specification for our products;

TSgjSjgggSEBBffBBBWiffWWWWWg^

Page 135

1   that what we do is try to maintain a product with a

2   consistent taste.  We do that against the

3   variability of tobacco; that is, from year to year

4   tobacco can be quite different because of the

5   growing conditions and that we have specifications

6   around tar yield.

7             I would also indicate that we would

8   expect nicotine yields to generally track tar

9   yields, but not -- they're not controlled in that

10   way.

11        Q.   Is the amount of nicotine in a particular

12   RJR brand of cigarette reasonably consistent from

13   month to month and year to year?

14        A.   I'm not sure exactly what you mean by

15   "reasonably."  It varies based upon the tobaccos.

16   I would expect that as long as there's a generally

17   consistent blend and there's a generally consistent

18   amount of tobacco in the rod, that the amount of

19   nicotine in the cigarette would be reasonably

20   consistent.

21             That being said, when someone smokes that

22   cigarette, the yields of nicotine could vary

23   substantially depending on how someone smokes.  And

24   a person smoking their own usual brand from puff to

25   puff and from cigarette to cigarette and from day

1   to day can yield quite different amounts of

2   nicotine from the cigarette.

3        Q.   I'm not talking about the way a person

4   smokes, sir.  Okay.  So let me go back to my

5   question.

6             Isn't it R.J. Reynolds' desire to have

7   the amount of nicotine in each brand of its RJR

8   cigarettes to be consistent from month to month and

9   year to year?

10             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

11        A.   As I've already indicated in several

12   answers, we strive to have a product that has a

13   consistent taste.  In doing that, we have to fight

14   against the natural variability of tobacco.

15   Tobacco is a natural product.  All of the tobacco

16   out in the field is not completely uniform from

17   stock position to stock position, from year to

18   year.

19             So, again, what we strive for is to have

20   a consistent taste signature; to have specific tar

21   yields, which there's a tolerance about.  We would

22   expect that generally nicotine would follow, but

23   it's not controlled in the manner that you're

24   implying.

1        Q.   All right.  Well, RJR controls the

2   formulation of the tobacco blend that goes into its

3   cigarettes, correct?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   RJR controls the processing of the

6   tobacco that goes into each of its cigarettes,

7   correct?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   RJR controls the amount of tobacco that

10   goes into each of its cigarettes, correct?

11        A.   Yes.

12        Q.   RJR controls the tar yield of its

13   cigarettes, correct?

14        A.  Yes.  As far as the machine-generated tar

15   yield.

16        Q.   If RJR controls the tar yield of its

17   cigarettes and nicotine yield follows tar yield,

18   then why can't you just agree that RJR controls the

19   nicotine yield of its cigarettes?

20        A.   Because if RJR was trying to control that

21   in the manner that you seem to be suggesting, we

22   would have a specification, we would do

23   measurements to make sure it was controlled, and we

24   would also recognize that it probably would have

25   some significant limitations from year to year.

1             So in other words, if you look at the FTC

2   tar yields reported to the government and reported

3   by the government to Congress over the years, the

4   tar and nicotine yields can vary and the nicotine

5   yield more so than the tar at times.  Again,

6   because it's not something that's being controlled.

7   It's not a specification.  It's not something which

8   we're controlling in the manner you're suggesting.

9        Q.   So you control the amount of tobacco, the

10   processing of the tobacco, the formulation of the

11   blend, the tar yield, you control all those things,

12   but you don't control the nicotine.  Is that your

13   statement?

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

15   It's been asked and answered.

16        A.   I believe I have answered the question.

17   What we don't  I mean, we don't control many

18   things, but we don't control what the tobacco

2                   A.        Yes.

3        Q.   So you were an employee of R.J. Reynolds    I

4   in 1983, correct?

5        A.   I was, yes.

6        Q.   Okay.  And as part of your employment

7   with R.J. Reynolds in 1983 you attended the tobacco

8   technology training courses, correct, sir?

9        A.   Yes.                                                                                      |

11   attend a staff training course, you attended it,      |

12   correct?

13        A.   I would say generally so.  If there were

14   conflicts, it may have been rescheduled or

15   whatever; but yes, generally I would have.

16        Q.   Okay.  In 1983 at the tobacco technology

17   training course there was a lecture given by

18   Jim Frederickson.  Do you know who Jim Frederickson

2
	A.  As far as attending in 1983, I don't

3
	recall that I attended in that year or not.  I may

4
	have attended the tobacco technology training

5
	course earlier than 1983.  It may have happened      j

6
	before that time.  As far as that particular year,

7
	I would have to review the agenda.  It's possible

8
	that he had such a lecture.

9
	Q.   Well, if Jim Frederickson is giving a

10
	lecture on "Nicotine and its Control in Blends" at    |

11
	a staff training course in 1983 more likely than      \

12
	not you were present, right?

13
	A.   No.  Again, if this is the training

14
	course that I believe you're referring to, it was

15
	generally something for new employees.  In 1983 I

16
	would have been with the company for three years.

17
	I believe I would have attended that training prior

18
	to that time, but I don't have a distinct

19
	recollection.                                        j

	BY MR. HAMMER:

7
	Q.   Sir, take a look at Page 1 of that

8
	exhibit.  And it says "Distribution," and it has a

9
	list of names.  And it looks like your name is        [

10
	listed as the, I think, ninth name down.              [

11
	A.   Yes.  I see I'm on this distribution.

12
	Q.   And if you go to the second page, there's

13
	a --   some language in parentheses with an asterisk    [

14
	that says "Will not attend the field trips but will

15
	be informed of the lectures."

16
	A.   I see that, yes.

17
	Q.   Your name doesn't have an asterisk on       f

18
	that first page, sir, does it?

19
	A.   No, it does not.

20
	Q.   And this is an interoffice memo from

21
	Howard Parks dated May 6th, 1983; and it lists what

22
	the complete course will consist of, correct, sir?

	Okay.  I've had a quick review.

2
	Q.   And if you look at Page 5 of that

3
	document at Number 17, it indicates "Nicotine and

4
	its Control in Blends" presentation by

5
	Jim Frederickson, correct, sir?

6
	A.   Yes.  That's what it says.

7
	Q.   Now Session 17 with the speaker listed as

8
	Jim Frederickson with the title "Nicotine and its

9
	Control in Blends," correct?                       \

10
	A.   Correct.  That's what it says.

11
	Q.   Do you have any reason to believe that      l

12
	you did not attend these lectures?

13
	A.   No.  I don't have any reason to believe

14
	that I didn't attend them.

15
	Q.   In fact, it's more likely than not that

16
	you would have attended these lectures.  Isn't that

17
	true, sir?                                         [

18
	A.   Yes.  I expect that I attended all if not

19
	most, depending on the circumstance.

20
	Q.   So by virtue of this document, you would

21
	have to agree that you received training from

22
	R.J. Reynolds regarding how to control nicotine in

23
	tobacco blends, correct?

24
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

	lectures.  And one of the things that's done is to

2
	try to have a uniform blend, as I've indicated, to

3
	try to have a uniform taste signature; and this was

4
	around blending, it would appear from the title.

5
	BY MR. HAMMER:

6
	Q.   Well, let's look at the title, sir.  It

7
	doesn't say tobacco blends.  It says, "Nicotine and

8
	its Control in Blends," right?  That's the title of

9
	the lecture, isn't it, sir?

10
	A.   Yes, that's the title of the lecture.

11
	Nicotine is something that's measured in blends to    [

12
	look at their uniformity.  That's different than

13
	the nicotine yield of a cigarette.

14
	Q.   Just looking at the title of this

15
	lecture, are you telling us that where it says the

16
	word I-T-S, "its," that's referring to nicotine,

17
	isn't it?

18
	A.   The title is suggesting control of

19
	nicotine in a blend, yes.

20
	Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

21
	Now, do you agree with the Surgeon

22
	General that nicotine addiction is the fundamental

23
	reason that individuals persist in using tobacco

24
	products?

1        A.   It is my view that for some individuals

2   nicotine can be a very important part of the

3   smoking experience; for others, that may not be the

4   most important part.  So I don't think that I can

5   characterize something as being uniform for all

6   individuals based on the science I'm aware of and

7   my general understanding.

8   BY MR. HAMMER:

9        Q.   Sir, you're familiar with the Surgeon

10   General's reports, right?

11        A.   I'm aware of a number of them, yes.

12        Q.   You're familiar with a Surgeon General

13   report released in 2010?

14        A.   I am, yes.

15        Q.   In fact, you're familiar with the fact

16   that your website basically boasts that they're in

17   alignment with the Surgeon General, correct?

18             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

19        A.   I don't recall that our website boasts

20   anything.  What I do recall is that in terms of

21   smokers we make available to them linkages to the

22   Surgeon General's reports, we suggest to them that

23   they should consider and rely upon the Surgeon

24   General reports if that's their choice.  We also

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

15        A.   I'm not sure that R.J. Reynolds has a

	Q.   All right, sir.  In your preparation as a

5
	witness for R.J. Reynolds in this case and others,

6
	have you read the Surgeon General's reports?          \

7
	A.   I've read throughout the course of my

8
	career, and also as part of preparing for some of

9
	the aspects of litigation, Surgeon General's

10

11
	2012 report to this point in time, but I've

12
	generally read through all the others, yes.

13
	Q.   Okay.  The 2010 Surgeon General's report    \

14
	is entitled "How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The

15
	Biology and Behavioral Basis for                    \

16
	Smoking-Attributable Disease."  Can you see this,

24
	chapter entitled "Nicotine Addiction, Past and

25
	Present," starts out in the introduction by saying

1   "Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that

2   individuals persist in using tobacco products and

3   this persistent tobacco use contributes to many

4   diseases described in this report."

5             Do you agree or disagree with that?

6             MR. KREINER:  I object to not  to

7   Dr. Borgerding not having the document in front of

8   him in order to testify about it.  But that

9   question has already been asked and answered.  Go

10   ahead, Doctor.

11        A.   Yes, I believe I have answered that.

12   That being said, assuming that you're reading

13   correctly and I have no reason to think that you're

14   not, I fully agree that that statement may be

15   present in the Surgeon General's report.  It's

16   based on the individuals who contributed to that

17   chapter.

18             Again, my understanding of the science is

19   that for some individuals it can be quite difficult

20   to quit; for others not.  And that for some that

21   find it difficult to quit, the theory is nicotine

22   may be part of that difficulty.

23             That being said, for example, in 2006

24   there is clear literature that suggests that about

25   half of smokers are not dependent.  So, again, when

4        Q.   That statement in the introduction of

7   Surgeon General report as well as the 2012 Surgeon

8   General's report?

16   correctly?

17        A.   I don't know that you are or are not, but

18   I don't have any reason to think that you're not.

19        Q.   So are you disagreeing with the statement

20   of the Surgeon General that they made in 1988 and

21   then reinforced in 2010 at Page 105 that "Nicotine

22   addiction is the fundamental reason that

19        A.   It's my view and R.J. Reynolds' view is

20   that nicotine in tobacco and tobacco products is

21   addicting.

22             That being said, it's also my

8   BY MR. HAMMER:

9        Q.   Would you agree or disagree with this

10   statement from the 2010 Surgeon General's report.

11   "Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes

12   addiction"?

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.  Again, I believe that I've addressed that

15   in my previous answers.  Nicotine in tobacco

16   products and in tobacco smoke is addictive.  That

17   being said, people smoke for a wide range of

18   reasons.  For many, nicotine is an important part

19   of the smoking experience.

20   BY MR. HAMMER:

21        Q.   Doctor, you know, I'm asking you a

22   question whether or not you agree or disagree.  I'm

23   not asking for an explanation.  If you want to give

24   an explanation after you give your answer, that's

25   fine.

7         Q.   Well, Doctor, if we were in trial and I

8    asked you a yes-or-no question, you have to answer

9    yes or no and then you can explain your answer.

10    Okay.  So let's pretend we're in a trial because

11    right now we're in a deposition and I'm asking you

12    questions.  So despite what your counsel says, I'm

13    asking the questions.  You can answer yes or no and

14    then feel free to explain your answers.  Okay?

15               MR. KREINER:  And I object to the

1        A.   Yes, I am.

2        Q.   As a scientist for R.J. Reynolds do you

3   want people to be addicted to your products?

4             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

5        A.   As a scientist for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

6   Company I want people to not be exposed to

7   toxicants.

8             In terms of addiction, addiction by

9   today's definition is something that suggests that

10   a product may be used for a period of time and may

11   be difficult to quit using.  But it is the

12   toxicants in tobacco products that are associated

13   with the risks.  So as a scientist, what I want is

14   to reduce the toxicants.

15             You took a break in the middle of my

16   answer to get a cup of coffee from someone.  It

17   would suggest to me that you find coffee to be

18   something that you enjoy.  By today's definition,

19   you may be addicted to coffee; but coffee does not

20   contain the same toxicants, so your addiction to

21   coffee would not be associated with particular

22   risk.

23             So from my point of view, it's not

24   addiction.  That being said, I do want anyone that

25   wants to stop smoking or to stop using tobacco

3        Q.   Well, if  can smoking a low-nicotine

4   cigarette be just as addictive as smoking a regular

5   cigarette?

6        A.   For some individuals I think that's

7   possible.  As well as for some individuals, they

8   would not find a cigarette that has, in relative

9   terms, higher levels of nicotine something that

10   they want to smoke either.

11        Q.   Well, nicotine -- as a scientist with

12   R.J. Reynolds, you know that nicotine can actually

13   be removed from the cigarette, correct?

14        A.   Nicotine can be greatly reduced.  To

15   completely eliminate it may not be feasible.

16        Q.  Well, it could certainly be removed down

17   to the level where cigarettes are non-addictive,

18   correct?

19             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

20        A.   My understanding as a scientist is there

21   is not something that's been established in terms

22   of a specific level that's addictive or not.  In

23   fact, there are active investigations being

24   supported by the FDA to investigate that premise.

25             My personal expectation is that as

	Q.   Question:  Did R.J. Reynolds produce a

12
	A.   To my knowledge R.J. Reynolds has not

13
	produced any cigarettes that have no nicotine in      \

14
	them, but they have produced cigarettes that have     j

	A.   In the smoke or in the product itself?

	Q.   Let's answer both ways.

22
	A.   The Now product I believe had probably on

23
	the order of 8 milligrams of nicotine in the

24
	cigarette itself.  Its nicotine yield, its

25  mainstream smoke yield, was so low that it couldn't

2
	Q.   And when was Now produced by

3
	R.J. Reynolds?

4
	A.   Now would have been produced by

	R.J. Reynolds in the 1970s, I believe, and some

6
	styles introduced around 1980.

	A.   No.  Now was in national distribution.      \

	Q.   In his 1973 paper Claude Teague wrote

2
	"Nicotine should be delivered about 1.0 to 1.3       ;

3
	milligrams per cigarette, the minimum for confirmed

4
	smokers."  Do you recall reading that in his paper,

5
	sir?

6
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7
	A.   I would need to review it.  But I recall

8
	there is a statement along those lines.  I find the   \

9
	statement quite puzzling in that based on the

10
	science of today and understanding the wide range

11
	of both yields and exposures, the statement doesn't   \

12
	seem to have any basis.

13
	Q.   Well, doesn't that indicate that RJR       \

14
	determined a long time ago how much nicotine was

15
	necessary in its cigarettes to maintain addiction?

16
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17
	A.   No.  The fact that this individual         ?

	determined it.

	naturally present in tobacco as well.  But in terms

2
	of ammonia from processing, ammoniated tobaccos

3
	would not be part of all the brands.

4
	Q.   Not in all the brands, but RJR does use     j

5
	ammoniated tobacco in some of their brands;

6
	correct, sir?

7
	A.   Yes.

8
	Q.   And you're aware of RJR internal

9
	documents that pertain to ammonia levels in

10
	competitors' products, right?

11
	A.   I'm not sure which documents you're         I

12
	referring to, but I'm aware there have been

13
	questions in that area and studies done over the      ?

14
	years, yes.

15
	Q.   Does RJR use any ingredients to increase

16
	the inherent addictiveness of its products?          \

17
	A.   No.

18
	Q.   For example, an ingredient that would

19
	alter the pH of the smoke?

20
	A.   No.  The concept is a theory that's been    \

21
	around for many years.  But the reality of it is

22
	that the pH of the smoke is something that isn't

23
	actually measurable.  Smoke pH depends very much on

24
	how smoke is captured, how the measurement is

25  conducted.  The same product tested by different

1   methods would give very different values.

2             That being said, there have been

3   suggestions, even by those in the Public Health

4   community, that one approach to reducing the risks

5   associated with smoking may be to increase pH.

6        Q.   Does RJR do testing to determine if a

7   change to the product affects its addictiveness?

8        A.   RJR fully stewards its products.  That

9   being said, there is no test for addictiveness.

10   There isn't a specific test.  This is an active

11   area of research, it's one that the FDA has put

12   forth in terms of their plans to see if upon

13   further investigation that's even a viable concept.

14        Q.  What does it mean when you say "RJR

15   stewards its products"?

16        A.  We have a philosophy, a guiding

17   principle, that we don't want to do anything to our

18   products or develop any new products that would

19   increase the inherent risks, the risks that are

20   present in all cigarettes.

21             So in terms of stewarding the products,

22   before any type of a change is made or before any

23   new type of cigarette design is considered, it's

24   fully reviewed by our toxicologists.  There's a

25   plan around collecting data to evaluate it on a

1   comparative basis with other products that already

2   exist to see if there's any change in the

3   chemistry, in the biology, in the product in

4   general that would suggest an increase in risk.

5        Q.  Does R.J. Reynolds use additives that

6   mask the harshness of tobacco?

7        A.   R.J. Reynolds uses additives to provide a

8   unique taste signature in terms of the way the

9   various brands taste.  In terms of masking

10   harshness, I think that they're looking for a smoke

11   that has an acceptable taste and something that the

12   smoker likes.

13        Q.   Does RJR use additives to mask the

14   harshness of lower-quality tobaccos?

15        A.   I think they would use them again to

16   provide a taste signature, to provide some uniform

17   way in which a product tastes; and that would be,

18   in part, dependent upon the tobaccos in the

19   product.

20        Q.   Would you agree or disagree with the

21   Surgeon General report from 2010 at Page 44 where

22   the Surgeon General says, "Specific additives are

23   applied to mask the harshness of lower-quality

1        A.   Again, the Surgeon General's report may

2   well say that.  I think in terms of the blend, the

3   blend is intended to provide a certain taste

4   signature.  Depending upon the tobaccos that are

9        Q.   When a cigarette is made less harsh, it

10   also becomes less irritating, correct?

11        A.   When it's made less harsh -- I'm not sure

12   how each individual would perceive it, but some may

13   perceive it as less irritating, yes.

14        Q.   And when a cigarette is made less harsh

15   and less irritating, it's easier to inhale,

16   correct?

17        A.   That's not my understanding.  My

18   understanding is that all of the cigarettes that we

19   have are inhalable; that smokers generally inhale,

20   but not all smokers inhale.

21        Q.   Well, let's talk about that a minute.

22             We talked about early that you're

23   knowledgeable in the area of cigarette design and

24   the history of the cigarette, correct?

25        A.   Generally so, yes.

1        Q.  Well, you're certainly aware that before

2   the modern cigarette became popular people smoked

3   cigars, people smoked hand-rolled cigarettes,

4   correct?

5        A.   I'm not sure exactly what you mean by

6   "the modern cigarette."  But yes, people have

7   smoked tobacco for many years, since pretty much

8   the time our country started.

9        Q.   Okay.  And when people smoked hand-rolled

10   cigarettes and cigars, you know for a fact that the

11   inhalability of those products are less than

12   today's modern cigarette.  Isn't that true, sir?

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.   In terms of hand-rolled cigarettes, I

15   don't know that that's true or not.  In terms of

16   pipes or cigars, cigars I think generally are not

17   inhaled.  Pipes may be inhaled somewhat, perhaps

18   not as much as a cigarette.

19   BY MR. HAMMER:

20        Q.   In fact, before tobacco became as we know

21   it now as the curing of tobacco, before that

22   started hand-rolled cigarettes were not inhaled

23   like they are today.  Isn't that true, sir?

1   cigarettes.  I'm not sure that there are any data

2   about hand-rolled cigarettes being inhaled or not.

3   What I know is that cigarette smoked from a

4   hand-rolled cigarette, from a nonfiltered

5   cigarette, and from a filtered cigarette are all

6   inhalable.

7   BY MR. HAMMER:

8        Q.   Sure.  Everything's inhalable.  I'm not

9   arguing that point.

10             My question is, certainly today's

11   cigarette is designed so it's easier to inhale than

12   plain tobacco.  Isn't that true, sir?

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.   I don't agree with that, no.

2             Menthol's anesthetizing effect makes the

3   smoke smoother and easier to inhale while masking

4   the harshness of tobacco.  Isn't that true, sir?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   I believe there may be individuals that

7   made that statement.  I wouldn't agree.  The reason

8   I would not agree is that menthol is provided to

9   provide a type of taste, a menthol taste; and

10   people that choose to smoke menthol cigarettes like

11   that taste.  So however they perceive to smoke,

12   they do; but they like that taste.

13   BY MR. HAMMER:

14        Q.   Isn't it true that menthol decreases the

15   metabolism of nicotine and increases the amount of

16   the addictive substance in the blood, thereby

17   making cigarettes even more dangerous and difficult

18   to quit?

19             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

20        A.   No.  The recent literature that I've read

21   and the recent epidemiology would not agree with

22   that statement.  I would disagree.

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form,

3   again, to asking Dr. Borgerding to comment on a

4   document that's not in front of him.

5        A.   I haven't seen what you're referring to,

6   but based upon the year that you indicated -- I

7   believe you indicated several years ago -- it could

8   not possibly be relying on recent publications.

9   Recent publications, for example, from an

10   epidemiologist at the FDA Center for Tobacco

11   Products says that the data clearly indicate

12   there's not an increased risk for smokers of

13   mentholated products versus non-mentholated

14   products.

15             There have also been quite a number of

16   studies in the past few years to the FDA around the

17   topics that you posed the question from, and they

18   would not agree with the statement that you made.

19   Based upon that science, I don't agree.

20        Q.   Sir, are you familiar with what's known

21   as a Frank Statement to cigarette smokers?

22        A.   Yes, I am.

23        Q.   And R.J. Reynolds was a signature on that

1        Q.   In your opinion then, having read this

4             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

5        A.   Yes, I believe that they were.  In fact,

6   from my standpoint I think that it was a very

7   important milestone in the company, that there was

8   a research department that had been developed prior

11        Q.   Okay.  And when you use the term

1   400,000 people die a year from tobacco-related

2   illnesses?

3        A.   I'm aware that there have been various

4   figures put forward, for example, on the CDC

5   website; but that those are not necessarily updated

6   very often.  I'm aware of at least a recent

7   publication that speaks to that.  It would be a

8   lower figure than the one that you referred to.

9        Q.   That averages out to about every minute

10   and a half someone dies from a tobacco-related

11   illness.  Have you ever thought about that?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13        A.   I don't know that I've thought about it

14   in that way.  What I have thought is that there's

15   significant risk associated with the use of

16   cigarettes and that I've worked for many years to

17   try to understand what drives those risks, along

18   with many other individuals, and to try and reduce

19   those risks.

20             So from my standpoint, the statistic of

21   dividing one number by another is not the most

22   important thing.  What's important is significant

23   risk exists and that we want to work to understand

24   and reduce that risk, and we've been working on

25   that for quite a while.

2        Q.  Well, in order to understand risk you

3   need to understand how many people die from your

4   product, don't you?

5        A.   You need to understand if there's a

6   significant risk or not; and if there is, action

7   needs to be taken.  Clearly from my standpoint, it

8   doesn't matter how you would have used the numbers

9   to divide and create a particular statistic.  The

10   key is there is a risk for smoking-related diseases

11   when someone smokes.  I would like to see that

12   significantly reduced, even eliminated ideally.

13        Q.   Well, when you say "eliminated," how

14   would you eliminate tobacco-related illness?

15        A.   In terms of tobacco-related illness, the

16   first thing that would need to be done conceptually

17   since you're asking a rhetorical question would be

18   to understand what drives the risk and then try to

19   eliminate that risk.

20        Q.   Sir, what causes the risk?

21        A.   Again, that's been the important

22   scientific question for many decades.  There are

23   many studies that have been conducted, there are

24   many prevailing views.  There's much work that's

5
	don't know the full answer.

6
	Q.   All right, sir.  Let me ask it a

7
	different way then.

8
	If a person does not smoke a cigarette,

9
	they are not put at risk of dying from smoking that

10
	cigarette, correct?

11
	A.   That's correct.  Anyone that's concerned    i

12
	about the risks of smoking and wants to quit should

13
	quit.                                                 i

14
	Q.   That's not my question, sir.

15
	I asked you about risk, and I asked you     I

16
	what causes that risk.  What causes the risk is the

17
	cigarette itself and smoking that cigarette.  Isn't

18
	that true, sir?

19
	A.   That's -- yes, there can be risks

20
	associated with the product obviously.  There can

21
	also be other risks that relate to the fact that

22
	someone is using a product.

23
	Q.   If a person were to jump off the Empire

24
	State Building, there's a risk that he would die,

25
	correct?

1        A.   As I indicated in my earlier answer,

2   there are millions of documents on that website.

3   I've been to the website, I've reviewed some

4   documents; but I'm not trying to suggest to you

5   that I've reviewed each and every document that's

6   there.

7        Q.   Okay.  Have you reviewed the public

8   statements that R.J. Reynolds officers and

9   directors have made to the American public?

10        A.   That's not been something I've researched

11   there.  I don't go to the one site very frequently.

12   When I have, it's often been for a scientific

13   question.

14        Q.   Would it surprise you to learn that

15   representatives from R.J. Reynolds have told the

16   American public that if it is established that

17   their product causes disease they will stop making

18   that product?

19             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

20   Assuming facts not in evidence.

21        A.   Again, that would surprise me if someone

22   from R.J. Reynolds had said that.  I think that my

23   understanding is that we've worked for many, many

24   years to understand what drives the risk and to

25   develop products that would reduce risk.

2        Q.   Well, sir, what drives the risk is the

3   cigarette, smoking the cigarette, correct?

4        A.   That is what drives exposure.  In terms

5   of the risk, it would be  there are many

6   different theories, but various constituents within

7   the smoke.

8        Q.   Okay.  Sir, you've acknowledged to me

9   just a little bit ago that if people didn't jump

10   from the Empire State Building it would eliminate

11   the risk of them dying from jumping from the Empire

12   State Building, correct?

13        A.   Yes.  In the hypothetical construct that

14   you've just done, you put forward an acute event

15   and said if the event is not there, it's not there,

16   right? And I agree with you that if they don't

17   jump from the Empire State Building, then they will

18   not have jumped and they will not have reached the

19   ground.

20        Q.   Okay.

21        A.   But in terms of cigarette smoking, the

22   work that we've done 

23        Q.   I haven't asked you anything about

24   cigarette smoking yet, sir.  That's my next

25        question.

1             In terms of cigarettes, if the cigarette

2   was not there anymore, it would prevent people from

3   starting smoking and getting disease from those

4   cigarettes, correct?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   If cigarettes were not a legal product in

7   our society, there would be no use of cigarettes

8   legally and there would be no exposure to cigarette

9   smoke assuming everyone followed those laws.

10   BY MR. HAMMER:

11        Q.   Well, forget about whether or not it's a

12   legal problem.  Okay?  You said your role at RJR is

13   regarding risk and risk assessment, correct?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And your goal you said was to eliminate

16   the risk, correct?

17        A.   Our goal is to understand and to reduce,

18   ideally to eliminate.  That's part of our

19   transforming tobacco strategy, which would also

20   include migrating smokers away from smoking

1   integrity in research and development responsible

2   for risk assessment, have you ever done a paper to

3   the RJR executives indicating to them that if they

4   eliminated the cigarette they would eliminate the

5   risk of people dying from their product.

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7        A.   First of all, to correct my title, I'm

8   not responsible for risk assessment, which is a

9   specific technical area.  I'm responsible for

10   clinical studies, which are part of evaluating

11   products.

12             That being said, our leadership has

13   already tried to transform tobacco.  There's not a

14   reason for me to send such a memo, in my opinion.

15   What I can tell you is that if our company were

16   only to produce combustible cigarettes and were not

17   focused on trying to understand and reduce risk and

18   develop products for people that want to keeping

19   use tobacco that would like to have less risk than

20   with a cigarette or if we did not have parts of the

2        Q.   Sir, do you agree with R.J. Reynolds

3   Tobacco Company when they say on their website that

4   they believe that individuals should rely on the

5   conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General?

6        A.   Yes, I do.  I believe that individuals

7   that smoke should rely upon the findings of the

8   Surgeon General, that they should consider those;

9   but of course it's up to them ultimately as to what

10   they do with those findings, but I would suggest

11   they should be aware of them and consider relying

12   upon them.

13        Q.   Okay.  I asked you if you had reviewed

14   the 2010 Surgeon General's report, I asked you have

15   you reviewed the 2012 Surgeon General's report

6             My impression in the time that I've spent

1        A.   I would need to see the citations there

2   and to what years they cite to.  They may have been

3   from some years ago.  The fact that it's stated in

4   the 2012 report does not mean it's based upon 2012

5   data.  In fact, it actually means it has to rely

6   upon data prior to that time.

7        Q.   Well, according to the 2012 Surgeon

8   General's report it indicates today, today -- 2012

9   Surgeon General's report -- "Today, nearly 1 in 4

10   high school seniors are smokers."  Do you disagree

11   with that?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13   It's been asked and answered.

14        A.   I believe I've answered the question in

15   my previous answers.

16             My understanding is that in our

17   population, adult smokers represent about

18   20 percent of the population.  I would be

19   surprised; and based on my general impressions from

20   things that I've read, the figure seems high to me.

21   That being said, no matter if it's 25 or

22   20 percent, I believe that we would like to see

23   that reduced.

2   which indicates that "Advertising and promotional

3   activities by tobacco companies have been shown to

4   cause the onset and continuation of smoking among

5   adolescents and young adults"?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7        A.   Again, in the time that I've spent with

8   it, I know that the focus of the report is along

9   the lines of your question.

10             Again, my impression is that it relies

11   upon data from years past, that today these may not

12   be the facts of the matter.  In fact, as I've

13   indicated, R.J. Reynolds would like to see youth

14   smoking rates  the decline of those rates

15   accelerate so that there's a more rapid decline.

16   We've worked with state governments to see if there

17   can be legislation imposing penalties for

18   possession of cigarettes by underage individuals.

19   We don't want them to use cigarettes.

1   such a document if youth smoking is not a problem?

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3        A.   I'm not trying to suggest to you that

4   youth smoking is not a problem; in fact, quite the

5   opposite.  In several of my answers I've indicated

6   that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company would like to

7   see the decline in youth smoking accelerate.  We

8   don't want anyone under age to smoke.  So I'm not

9   trying to suggest to you that with or without a

10   2012 report that focused on it that we should not

11   try and reduce that.  It's what we do want to do.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   Well, sir, you're certainly aware of the

14   fact that smokers die every day, correct? We

15   talked about that already.

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   In order to keep R.J. Reynolds in

18   business, you have to replace those smokers, don't

19   you?

21        A.   In terms of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

22   Company, our view is on transforming tobacco.  We

24   want to use tobacco products that reduce risk.  So,

1   concerned about the risks of smoking, we would like   \

4   that are concerned about risk, the first thing we     j

6             So from the standpoint of the company,

17   advertising and promotion increases the likelihood    \

6
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7
	A.   What is a preoccupation?

8
	BY MR. HAMMER:

9
	Q.   Yes.                                          =

10
	A.   Again, something -- I mean, literally it

11
	would be something before an occupation.

12
	Generally, I think that preoccupation would mean

13
	something that's being focused on or dwelled upon.

14
	Q.   Are you aware that in 1973 that

15
	R.J. Reynolds had a preoccupation with the youth      j

16
	market and that they described the youth market as

17
	that of 14- to 20-year-old smokers?

18
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.        \

19
	A.   Again, I don't know the document that

20
	you've got in your hands.  As far as that document,

21
	it may be the opinions of some individuals; it's

22
	not something that the company is saying.  I would

23
	say that today Reynolds has a preoccupation with

24
	reducing youth smoking with accelerating the

25  decline.

2        Q.   If they had a preoccupation in 1973 with

3   the youth market of 14- to 20-year-old smokers,

4   would you agree that that would be a wrong

5   preoccupation?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7   Assumes facts not in evidence, calls for

8   speculation.

9        A.   I don't know what that would mean.  I

10   don't know what document you're referring to.  I

11   don't know the mind-set of the individuals that

12   wrote it.  It's not something, if I understand what

13   you're saying, that's consistent with our policy or

14   the actions of the company.

15   BY MR. HAMMER:

16        Q.  All right.  Well, if today R.J. Reynolds

17   had a preoccupation with the youth market and they

18   defined the youth market as 14 to 20, would that be

19   something that's the right thing to do?

20             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

21        A.   Again, I think it depends upon what

22   preoccupation means in the context and so on.  What

23   we do want to do is see youth smoking accelerate as

24   far as the decline.

1        Q.   That's not what I asked you, sir.  Come

2   on.

3             My question is this.  If today

4   R.J. Reynolds on its website had this phrase, "We

5   have a preoccupation with the youth market of 14-

6   to 20-year-old smokers," would that statement be a

7   right statement or a proper statement to make

8   today?

9             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10        A.   It would depend upon the rest of the

11   statement and the context.  I don't know.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   How about if on its website  if we

14   pulled up R.J. Reynolds' website and it said today

15   "R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has a preoccupation

16   with sustaining the youth market of 14- to

17   20-year-old smokers," would that be a statement

2        Q.   Okay.  And today would it be wrong for

3   R.J. Reynolds to study the 14- to 20-year-old

4   market in hopes of uncovering the secret of getting

5   them to switch to their product?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

7        A.   Again, it would not be consistent with

8   our policy, it would not be consistent with our

9   views around transforming tobacco.  It would not be

10   something that should be there, no.

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.   It would not be consistent.  It shouldn't

16   on our policies and our transforming tobacco

17   approach.

20   reprehensible.  Would you agree with that?

22        A.   It's something that I would be surprised

23   with since it would be directly contradictory to

25   would not support doing.  I would be offended by

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3        A.   Today I would consider that completely

4   inappropriate, completely inconsistent with the

5   goals of the company.

6             That being said, tobacco is a legal

7   product in terms of smokers being 18 and above.

8   You keep referring to a range that goes up to

9   20 years of age.  So smokers that are 18 and above

10   can smoke cigarettes legally.

11   BY MR. HAMMER:

12        Q.   What about though if your company decided

13   to target kids beginning at age 14, 15, 16, 17; not

14   18 and above, but 14, 15, 16, 17? Would you find

15   that conduct reprehensible?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   Today with the legal age being 18, I

18   would find that to be again, as I've already stated

19   in several answers, completely contradictory to our

20   guiding principles and beliefs.  It's not something

21   I would support.  I'd find it to be inappropriate.

22   I would consider it to be wrong.

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3   Assumes facts not in evidence.

4        A.   I would find that to be inconsistent with

5   my experiences as I've worked with the company.

6             And, again, as I indicated in an earlier

7   answer, in terms of our society, things have

8   changed over the last several decades, during my

9   lifetime.  The legal ages to smoke cigarettes have

10   varied from state to state, is my understanding,

11   from year to year.  So I don't know that I can

12   speak to each of those specific ages.  It would

13   depend upon the time and the circumstances.

14             But generally, it's not been our policy,

15   I'm not aware that it's been done.  We don't market

16   to youth.

17   BY MR. HAMMER:

18        Q.   Sir, my question was, if you learn that

19   it was done, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?

20             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

21   It's been asked and answered.

22        A.   I believe I've answered the question.  I

23   think depending upon the circumstances, I would

24   view that as wrong, yes.

4        A.  We have individuals that are

5   knowledgeable there.  I don't know if they have

6   degrees specifically in epidemiology or not, but we

7   have individuals that are quite knowledgeable in

8   that area.

9        Q.   Okay.  I understand.

10             My question was, do you know whether or

12   degrees in epidemiology?

13             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14        A.   No, I don't.  For those currently focused

21   history, but I would consider Dr. John Robinson,

22   for example, I believe his degrees were in

4        A.   I have not worked in the marketing

19   example, that one of those individuals has a

20   master's in that area.  I don't know her degree

21   right off.  But we do have people who are

22   knowledgeable in that area.

1        Q.   And what division does Kristin Marano

2   work in?

3        A.   She works in our regulatory oversight

4   area.

5        Q.   Can you just tell me what regulatory

6   oversight is?

7        A.   That's the part of our company that is

8   responsible for coordinating all of the general

9   activities related to regulation.  So they would be

10   the primary interface with the FDA, for example, in

11   terms of the various types of meetings that have

12   gone on.  They would set some of our strategy on

13   how we're going to comply with the requirements.

14   So it's a small group, but that would be their

15   function.

16        Q.   Now, you're aware that for many years --

17   and we've already established it today -- RJR

18   acknowledges that smoking cigarettes causes COPD,

19   causes lung cancer, causes other diseases.  We've

20   established that and they put it on their website

21   in 1999/2000, right?

22        A.   Yes.

23        Q.  Okay.  Prior to that time RJR refused to

24   agree that smoking caused disease because that

25   conclusion was based on epidemiology.  Isn't that

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

3        A.   I don't believe that they ever refused to

4   do something.  I think that, again, the science

5   unfolded over many years, that some of the early

6   science was around epidemiology, that since that

7   point in time there's been a tremendous amount of

8   work that's been done.  Some of that, a large body

9   of that, is summarized in the 2010 Surgeon

10   General's report that talks about for the first

11   time that we now understand more about the

12   mechanisms of many of the diseases.

13   BY MR. HAMMER:

14        Q.  Well, there were reports as early as

15   nineteen  late 1940s, early 1950s that linked

16   cancer to cigarettes, correct?

17        A.   There have been quite a number of

18   reports.  I think that probably some of the key

19   events in understanding the risks associated with

20   tobacco and with cigarette smoking specifically

21   were some of the events that started in the 1950s.

22             That being said, there's been work that's

23   gone on ever since then to understand the complex

24   area.

1   as the '50s.  In fact, we already talked about

2   Claude Teague's 1953 paper that addressed a lot of

3   the studies that were out there, correct?

4        A.   He did a survey of the literature at that

5   time.  He was --

6        Q.   Right.

7        A.   He was clear, if I recall, that it was

8   not necessarily a complete survey.  It's what he

9   had available to review.

10        Q.   And that's also when the Ernst Wynder

11   studies came out, the mouse painting studies.

12   You're familiar with those, right?

13        A.   They would have been, if I recall

14   correctly, perhaps in late 1954, but that general

15   time frame.

16        Q.  And that's actually what prompted the

17   1953 meeting between the tobacco companies and the

18   release of the 1954 Frank Statement, right?

22        A.   I don't know the history of that meeting,

23   as far as what prompted it.  What I do know is that

1   that point in time; and that based upon the

2   research that was emerging, the reports that were

3   emerging, they began conducting a wide range of

4   research activities to understand what drives the

5   risk and reduce the risk.

6        Q.   Let me just make sure I understand you

7   correctly.

8             As an expert testifying here today and as

9   you've testified before in other cases as a

10   corporate rep, you're not aware of the background

11   behind the Frank Statement and the formation of the

12   TIRC?  You didn't study that?

16        Q.   Are you aware that there were findings

17   made that R.J. Reynolds, along the other major

18   tobacco companies, conspired to conceal the truth

19   about tobacco, the addictive nature of tobacco, and

20   the harms that it causes for a period of 50 years?

21             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

2   findings.  That's what we're here about.

3        A.   I am aware of them, yes.

4        Q.  And that's based on a conspiracy that

5   existed between the tobacco companies hiding,

6   concealing facts from the American public, correct?

7             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  It

8   misstates the findings.

9        A.   I'm not here to dispute the Engle

10   findings.  They're findings that are binding upon

11   the company in this matter, is my understanding.

12   They are what they are.

14        Q.   You've mentioned before that RJR has

15   worked with the FTC.  You mentioned that before in

16   your prior testimony.  Do you recall that?

17        A.   I do, yes.

19   with the FTC in the mid-'90s and state tobacco

20   control departments in Massachusetts and Texas in

21   '97 and through '99.  Do you recall talking about

22   that in prior testimony?

23        A.   I do, yes.

2        A.   I'm not sure specifically what you're

3   referring to; but if it's the matters you just

4   indicated that I was directly involved in, those

5   were voluntary, is my understanding.  There's

6   nothing that required my interaction there or the

7   company to interact on that matter.

8   BY MR. HAMMER:

9        Q.   Well, aren't you aware that RJR was

10   mandated by the FTC to work with Massachusetts and

11   Texas tobacco control departments?

12             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.  Assumes

13   facts not in evidence.

14        A.   No.  That's not my understanding at all.

15   My understanding is that the FTC is a federal

16   agency that had certain federal responsibilities

17   and that the state agencies had their objectives

18   and responsibilities.

19             As one that directly interacted with each

20   of those bodies, my understanding and impression

21   throughout the entire series of processes and

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3        A.   I'm not sure what you mean by "mandated."

4   I'm not aware or don't recall any documents that

5   suggested that the FTC said it might be a good

6   idea, if that's what you're considering a mandate.

7             But if you're suggesting there was some

8   legal requirement or something that made that a

9   mandatory requirement, I'm not aware of that.

10   BY MR. HAMMER:

11        Q.   You testified previously that

12   R.J. Reynolds has worked with the FDA.

13        A.   Yes.  We are currently regulated by the

14   FDA, we interact with the FDA.  We've had many

15   meetings with the FDA, attended workshops, provided

16   scientific input to the process.

17        Q.   To your understanding has R.J. Reynolds

18   fully cooperated with the FDA?

19        A.   Yes.

20        Q.   Well, are you familiar with the Family

21   Smoking Prevention Tobacco and Control Act?

22        A.   I am.

23        Q.   That's part of the FDA, correct, the FDA

24   tobacco act?

25        A.   That is the act that we are regulated

United Reporting, Inc

954-525-2221

Page 213

1        under,   yes.

2        Q.   So didn't R.J. Reynolds file a lawsuit

3   challenging certain provisions of the FDA act?

4        A.   My understanding is R.J. Reynolds has

5   filed a number of lawsuits, a very small number;

6   that they have not challenged the FDA's role in

7   terms of regulating the tobacco company; that there

8   are certain matters that have had legal issues,

9   have had constitutional issues, and in a very small

10   number of these, after dialogue, have led to

11   litigation.

12        Q.   Okay.  So rather than cooperate, RJR has

13   decided to litigate?

14             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

15        A.   I would not agree at all with that

16   characterization, no.

17   BY MR. HAMMER:

18        Q.   Well, they filed a lawsuit in August of

19   2009, correct? You're aware of that, correct?

20        A.   I don't know the exact date; but yes, in

21   that time frame.

22        Q.   Okay.  And that lawsuit challenged

23   provisions such as the ones pertaining to modified

24   risk tobacco products and continuity programs,

4
	were various aspects to it -- I don't know all the

12
	A.   That's my understanding, yes.

	specifying nine new graphic warnings, correct?       |

16
	A.   No.  My understanding is that they

17
	challenged the graphics.  They didn't challenge the

18
	concept of having the warnings.

19
	Q.   They challenged specifically the graphic    \

20
	warnings, correct?

21
	A.   Not the warning as such, but the graphic.

22
	Q.   Is there a difference between the graphic   |

1   how the courts have ruled.

2        Q.   It doesn't matter, sir.

3             Tell you what.  Is it your understanding

4   that when the government wanted to place warnings

5   initially on the cigarette packs that RJR also

6   challenged that back in 1966?

7             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

8        A.   I don't know that they challenged it or

9   not.  I believe that Congress decided to have

10   warnings on the packs, and Reynolds has fully

11   complied with those warnings throughout the years.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   They didn't initially agree to it though,

14   did they, sir?  They fought it, didn't they, just

15   like they're fighting the warnings today?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   I don't know that they challenged it in

18   that way or not.  I don't know if there was any

19   litigation that the courts would have ruled upon or

20   not at that point in time.

21   BY MR. HAMMER:

22        Q.   You said that you're focused on harm

23   reduction, correct?

24        A.   We're focused on transforming tobacco,

25   and harm reduction is part of transforming tobacco.

1   So transforming tobacco would include not only the

2   concept of harm reduction but the concept of

3   accelerating the decline in youth smoking and other

4   aspects as well.

5        Q.   Do you think that introducing new

6   products rather than withdrawing those already

7   being sold is a good method of harm reduction?

8             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9        A.   I believe that our program is

10   appropriate, and cigarettes  if you're asking

11   should cigarettes be removed from the marketplace,

12   they are a legal product, they're something the FDA

13   has jurisdiction over.  The FDA has the ability to

14   consider performance standards for the product.

15             But to this point in time I have no

16   understanding that the government is considering

17   them being something that is not a legal product in

18   our society.

19             So that being said, I think someone that

20   chooses to smoke or has been concerned about the

21   risks of smoking should have a range of products

22   and should also consider quitting as options

23   available to them.

24             But if R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company were

25   to stop selling combustible cigarettes, burn-down

	it is a product that's been in our society since

1   no such thing as a risk-free tobacco product.

2   Isn't that true, sir?

3        A.   That's correct.  There's no tobacco

4   product that has no risk; but there are products

5   that have greatly reduced risk, products that

6   reduce exposure to toxicants and products that are

7   quite different in their risk profile.  Those have

8   been developed over the course of those decades.

9        Q.   Okay.  Forgetting about their risk

10   profile, my question is this, sir.

11             In the 30-plus years that you have been

12   with R.J. Reynolds you, as a scientist, have been

13   able to conclusively establish that there is no

14   such thing as a safe tobacco product, correct?

15             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

16   It's been asked and answered.

17        A.   I believe that I have answered the

18   question.  It is my view that there is no such

19   thing currently as a safe tobacco product; that is,

20   one that is devoid of all risk.

21   BY MR. HAMMER:

22        Q.   How much longer do you anticipate working

23   for R.J. Reynolds?

24        A.   I don't have an anticipation as far as

25   when I may or may not stop working for Reynolds.  I

1   would expect I'm closer to the end of my career

2   than the beginning of my career.

3        Q.   Okay.  Do you foresee discovering a

4   tobacco product that is safe while you're there at

5   R.J. Reynolds?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

7        A.   In terms of my expectations, a principal

8   reason that I continue to work at Reynolds is the

9   efforts to achieve what you're alluding to; that

10   is, the efforts to understand and reduce the risks

11   associated with tobacco products.

12             I think that there are products that have

13   had greatly reduced amounts of exposure and risk

14   associated with them that have been developed, and

15   I think that it's possible that there may

16   eventually be a product that's classified as a

17   tobacco product that would not have any difference

18   in risk for tobacco-related disease as compared to

19   non-tobacco use.

20             That may or may not happen, but I think

21   there are products today that are greatly reduced

22   in risk and are moving in that direction.

23        Q.   I understand your answer, sir, but can

24   you say to a jury as you sit here today that you

25   are confident that you or any other scientist at

5        A.   Again, I do not believe that it's

6   possible for a combustible tobacco product, but I

8   that would eventually be considered to be devoid of   j

1   talks about the fact that the public should look to

2   the Surgeon General, correct?

3        A.   It provides links to those reports and

4   suggests they should consider those reports and

5   rely upon those if they choose to, yes.

6        Q.   Well, it doesn't say "if they choose to."

7             Your website actually says,

8   "R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company believes that

9   individuals should rely on the conclusions of the

10   U.S. Surgeon General."

11        A.   Yes.  I believe there are two sections of

12   the website.  One suggests they should rely upon

13   it; another says they should consider it.  Clearly,

14   they should rely upon it.  Again, it's their choice

15   as to what they do or don't rely upon; but the

16   company wants them to be aware of it and provides

17   those links.

18        Q.   Well, it's interesting because the 2010

19   Surgeon General's report says that cigarette

20   smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths

21   in the United States, and yet your website says

22   smoking cigarettes is a leading cause.  You don't

23   use the word "the."  Why is that?

24             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

25        A.   I don't know that I can speak to that

1   specifically in that I didn't create the website.

2   But my understanding from everything that I've read

3   is that in even recent years there's been a decline

4   related to smoking.

5             At the same time, there's been an

6   increase related to things like obesity and lack of

7   exercise.  So I think it's the fact that things are

8   changing in our society and in our world.  Again,

9   the Surgeon General's report In 2010 is looking

10   backward from that point in time.

11             Even today from year to year, there are

12   significant declines in the incidents of smoking.

13   There are significant declines, as we spoke about

14   earlier or at least as I spoke about in an earlier

15   answer, in terms of what's being reported about

16   smoking-related deaths.  And so I believe that it's

17   changing.  It's clearly a leading cause.  It may or

18   may not be the leading cause, but it is a leading

19   cause.

20        Q.   Well, if smoking is not the leading cause

21   of preventable deaths in the United States, what

22   is?

23        A.   Again, as I indicated a very important

24   one today and one that would be in the same general

25   order of magnitude, would be obesity, lack of

1   exercise, diet, the general health of the country

2   is being cited.

3        Q.   Well, on the same note, the 2010 Surgeon

4   General's report says, "This 2010 report of the

5   Surgeon General explains beyond a shadow of a doubt

6   how tobacco smoke causes disease."  Are you

7   familiar with that term 

8             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9   BY MR. HAMMER:

10        Q.    that the Surgeon General uses?

11        A.   In my reading of the report, I believe

12   that it makes a statement like that.  But it's also

13   in the chapters, the authors that wrote the various

14   ones, indicate that there's the need for much more

15   research.  So if you read the report in its

16   entirety, you'll hear both that we now know the

17   answer as well as there's much more research that's

18   needed.

19        Q.   Well, on their website why doesn't

20   R.J. Reynolds  since they recommend their

21   consumers to look to the Surgeon General, why

22   doesn't R.J. Reynolds acknowledge that it is proven

23   beyond a shadow of a doubt that tobacco smoke

24   causes disease; but instead they say that "smoking

25   cigarettes significantly increases the risk of

...                                                                               ro

2             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

3        A.   On the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

4   websites it provides guiding principles and beliefs

5   for our company.  It states that cigarette smoking

6   causes a number of tobacco-related or

7   smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer,

8   CVD, COPD.  So that's quite clear on the website.

9             The website also indicates, as I've

10   stated in several answers now, that R.J. Reynolds

11   Tobacco Company doesn't necessarily agree with all

12   of the findings of the Surgeon General or all the

13   statements of the Surgeon General, but does suggest

14   to smokers that they should rely upon those reports

15   and provides links to them.

1   addicted to it since the addiction causes long-term

2   exposure to the carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

3             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

4        A.   I believe that I've answered that

5   question in a series of earlier questions you've

6   posed to me.  Again, nicotine itself -- and there

7   have been many studies of it, it's approved for use

8   as nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.

9             Nicotine itself does not have significant

10   toxicity associated with it, so it's not something

11   that's associated with the risks of smoking.

12   BY MR. HAMMER:

13        Q.   Well, sir, if someone becomes addicted to

14   nicotine such that they smoke cigarettes for the

15   nicotine as a result of their addiction and they

16   get disease because of their exposure to the

17   carcinogens, then doesn't logic say that nicotine

18   is considered a significant threat to health?

19             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

20   Incomplete hypothetical.

21        A.   Again, in your hypothetical I believe the

22   answer would be that it's the risk of smoking in

23   its entirety that causes disease.  It's the

24   toxicants that cause it.  People smoke, as I've

25   indicated in several answers now, for a wide range

1   of reasons.  So I would not agree with your logic

2   as such.

3   BY MR. HAMMER:

4        Q.   What's your understanding of why people

5   smoke?

6        A.   As I've indicated in quite a number of

7   answers, my understanding is people smoke for a

8   wide range of reasons.  Some -- I mean, generally,

9   people like to smoke because they enjoy the taste,

10   they enjoy the ritual, they enjoy the whole aspect

11   of smoking.

12        Q.  Okay.  Sir, if people smoke because they

13   enjoy the taste, then why not make a cigarette

14   nicotine-free that just tastes good?

15        A.   Again, from the standpoint of reducing

16   harm  I'm sorry, reducing risk, the important

17   thing is not only to, for example, reduce the

18   toxicants in smoke but to have a

19   consumer-acceptable product.  So a product that

20   people don't use won't reduce those risks if the

21   premise is that they're going to keep using

22   cigarettes.

23        Q.   Sir, that's not my question.  You just

24   said that people smoke for the taste, correct?

25        A.   I said that people smoke for a wide range

2        Q.   One of them being taste, correct?

3        A.  Yes.  One of them being, for many

4   individuals, taste.

5        Q.   Okay.  If individuals smoke for taste,

6   then why not make a cigarette that tastes good but

7   has no nicotine in it so people don't get addicted?

8             MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

9        A.   Again, the data that are available from

10   the studies that have been done from the products

11   that have been introduced into market suggest two

12   things.  One is that nicotine is part of the taste,

13   part of the feel of the smoke.  It's part of the

14   balance of the smoke.  It's important to how people

15   perceive the taste.

16             There are also data that suggest that for

17   products that have reduced nicotine, people may be

18   exposed to greater amounts of toxicants, not less.

20   so simple as you're putting forward.

15   nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco products

16   and tobacco products are recognized as being

12
	review it.  They may be thoughts he's had or

1   The best I understand it, he had thoughts, he

2   committed them to paper, and that was that.

3        Q.   You mentioned that you're not aware that

4   anyone at RJR ever suggested that a product be

5   developed for youth?

6        A.   I believe I've addressed this in several

7   answers, and what I've indicated is it's been our

8   policy not to market cigarettes to nonsmokers, not

9   to market to youth; and I'm not aware of anyone

10   ever having done that.

11             I don't know the thoughts of each

12   individual that's worked with the company during

13   the time they've been there; but that's my

14   understanding of the views of the company, its

15   policy, and its actions as a company.

16        Q.  And is it your testimony that the various

17   products that we talked about earlier that had the

18   different flavorings  and I found the names of

19   the products, and let me run those by you and see

20   if those refresh your recollection.

21             We talked about the berry flavor, the

22   pineapple and coconut flavor, we talked about the

23   toffee flavor.  But the actual names of the

2             Do you remember the names of those

3   various products that RJR manufactured?

4        A.   Those are products that were part of a

5   group called Camel Exotics.  And as I've indicated

6   in my earlier answers to your questions, I believe

7   the press release in 2006 speaks to those products.

8   Those were products that were developed based upon

9   the input of adult smokers.  They said at that

10   point in time that they would like an opportunity

11   occasionally to smoke something other than their

12   usual brand, something that tasted different; and

13   based upon interaction with the adult smokers,

14   these were brands that were developed.

15             They were never brands that had a

16   particularly large market share.  They were less

17   than a tenth of a share, as I recall in the press

18   release.  That's what those products were.

19        Q.   And it's your testimony that that line of

20   cigarettes that tasted like candy and fruit flavors

21   were not designed to target the youth market?

5   BY MR. HAMMER:

6        Q.   In order for R.J. Reynolds to continue

7   selling cigarettes, you need to replace the smokers

9             MR. KREINER:  Objection.  It's

10   argumentative and was asked and answered earlier.

11        A.   I have addressed that earlier.  Our view,

12   our guiding principle, is that we want to transform

13   tobacco; and in doing that, there's nothing in

14   there that suggests we're trying to replace

15   existing smokers with anyone.

3   of legal age that smoke cigarettes and may begin

4   smoking cigarettes.  As I've indicated in numerous

5   answers, this is something that my understanding is

6   declining.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company would

7   like to see the rate of that decline accelerate.

8   BY MR. HAMMER:

9        Q.   I just want to make sure I heard you

10   correctly, sir.  Did you just say under oath that

11   it's your understanding that the average age of

12   those people that begin to smoke cigarettes is

4        A.   I've tried to indicate in a number of

5   answers now what our guiding principle, what our

6   direction is in terms of transforming tobacco.  In

7   terms of transforming tobacco, I expect that we

8   will provide products other than cigarettes for

9   those that want to use tobacco.

10   BY MR. HAMMER:

11        Q.   Yeah.  But you're still providing

12   cigarettes.  So the people that smoke your

13   cigarettes, in order to keep your cigarette

14   business in business, you are dependent upon them,

15   correct?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   What I'm trying to communicate, sir, is

18   that we're a total tobacco company.  We do not see

19   as a company our future being cigarettes.  We see

20   it being products that transform the industry and

21   move away from cigarettes.

22   BY MR. HAMMER:

23        Q.   If that's truly what your plan is, then

24   stop making cigarettes and then people would use

25   your other products.  Isn't that true, sir?

6        Q.   Sir, if you didn't have any new smokers

7   of your cigarettes, at the rate that people are

8   dying from cigarette-related disease, your business

9   would go out of business with regard to the

10   cigarette business, correct?

11             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

12   It's an improper and incomplete hypothetical.

13        A.   I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.

14             Let me say that in terms of the number of

15   cigarettes sold, it's greatly declined for many

16   years.  The number of smokers in the United States

17   has also greatly declined.  There are far more

18   former smokers than current smokers.

19             Our current business is to transform

20   tobacco and provide products that have the

21   potential to reduce risk, products other than

22   combustible cigarettes.

6   report it's been estimated that worldwide tobacco

7   use caused 100 million deaths during the

8   20th century and that tobacco use may cause as many

9   as 1 billion deaths in the 21st century.  Do you

10   agree or disagree with that?

12        A.   I don't have a basis to agree with those

13   specific figures.  To me, what it underscores is

14   the importance of the research that we're doing to

15   understand the risks and to produce products with

16   reduced risk.  It's a significant scientific

11   those ads.

12             MR. HAMMER:  In fact, why don't we take

13   about five minutes and go off tape and let the

14   witness look through those ads because I want to

15   ask him some questions, as a group, of those ads.

16   This way he can review all the ads, and then I can

17   ask him some questions rather than sit here while

18   he does that.

19        A.   Before we do that, I would note in just

20   looking at the first one, they're very bad

21   photocopies and I can't read most of what's on this

22   page.  So I'll look through all of them; but if

23   they're all like this one, most of this is not

10        Q.   All right.  Sir, you've had a chance to

11   take a look at the exhibit that's now marked as

12   Exhibit Number 10, which is a composite exhibit

13   made up of I believe 11 or 12 pages.  Is that

14   correct?

15        A.   I get 11.  I can count one more time, if

16   you would like.

17        Q.   I think that's right.  I think there's 11

18   there.  But just to make sure, why don't --

19        A.   Count again?  Again, I arrive at 11.

20        Q.   Have you had an opportunity to take a

21   look at those, sir?

22        A.   I did look through them.  I found that no

23   matter with and without my bifocals, I had three

24   kinds of vision; and I can read parts of them, but

25   not all of them.

1        Q.   Okay.  But in looking at them though in a

2   group, I can tell you that most likely when it

3   comes to the trial we will be introducing those;

4   and I would represent to you that those are ads

5   from June roughly -- actually, from the period of

6   time of 1941 through 1945.

7        A.   In my review I noted some of the dates

8   when I could read them.  I noted that it was the

9   early 1940s.  I didn't necessarily see all of the

10   dates that you just indicated.  And, again, that's

11   marked at the bottom, but I don't know that they

12   did or didn't actually run then.  If you would like

13   me to check and see if I can find one as early as

14   '41 or as late as '45, I'm happy to.

15        Q.   Well, that's all right.  I can tell you

16   that the one that you've got there in front of you

17   that is Number 95 and Number 94 

18        A.   I have them here.

19        Q.   -- those are from 1941, which would have

20   been, according to what you've provided, around the

21   time that Helen Cohen became a regular smoker,

22   right?

23        A.   Yes.  I see that at the bottom of these

24   two it indicates that they appeared in various

25   periodicals or newspapers or whatever in 1941.  The

24

25

9        A.  Again, from what I can see in these,

10   there are adult women, some women in the service

11   and so on.  So as far as distinguished, I believe

12   some of them refer to other people as well, if

13   that's what you're asking me.

14        Q.   Well, if you look at the one that 

15        A.   I do see, if I may add, in Number 47, for

16   example, it says, "Among the many other

17   distinguished American women who prefer the extra

18   mildness of Camel cigarettes."  I can't read it

19   particularly, but there are lists of what appear to

20   be individuals under that.

3
	Q.   So the other Number 4 that we're looking

4
	at also, again, talking about women of the war?

5
	A.   Yes.

6
	Q.  And then there's another couple of them

7
	from 1944, Number 93 and Number 24, also

8
	referencing women in the war.

9
	A.   Yes.  93 is particularly difficult to

10
	read, but I believe that's correct.  You said

11
	they're from which year?

12
	Q.   1944.

13
	A.   Yes.  I believe that's correct.

14
	Q.   The 93 you're looking at is entitled

15
	"Young Lady with a Lens"?

16
	A.   That's correct, yes.

17
	Q.   And it references "First in the Service"?

21
	her rank is sergeant, her cigarette is Camel.

22
	A.   Yes.  I believe that's correct.

23

24
	from 1941 to 1944, would you agree that these ads

5   women that are in our military at that point in

A.   I have three daughters, yes. Q.   And they grew up in your household, right?  You saw them, you watched them grow up, correct?

I did, yes.

Did any of your daughters smoke growing

A.

Q.

up, sir? A. Q.

No, they didn't.

As they were growing up, as they were young girls ages 15, 16, 17, were they influenced by advertising growing up?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. Speculation.

A.   Again, I expect they were -- they experienced much advertising in the world as you indicated in an earlier comment.  We have advertising throughout our society.  I'm sure that they paid more attention to some ads than others. That's the nature of advertising. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.   Very true.  As your children grew up in your household, when they saw something in an ad that they wanted, did they make you aware of it?

A.   I don't recall them ever coming to me saying, you know, "I saw this in an ad; now I'd

	A.   My understanding of advertising is it's

	intended to advertise products.

	BY MR. HAMMER:

8
	Q.   With the intention for consumers and

9
	people that see the ads to buy the product, right?

10
	A.   With those that are interested in the       |

11
	products to buy them, yes.                          =

12

16
	advertising.  My general understanding of           |

17
	advertising and much of what I see in the world

18
	today, is that it's about choices.  If someone is

19
	going to consider the purchase of a new vehicle,

20
	there are ads that tell them about different         j

21
	choices and they may choose one of those.

22
	And so advertising makes individuals

23
	aware of a product, that are interested in that

24
	product.  For me personally, much of the

25  advertising that goes on today, I don't pay any

3             MR. HAMMER:  Now might be a good time to

4   stop since I'm going to go into another topic

5   that's going to take awhile.  So based on our

6   discussion that we had earlier, why don't we stop

7   this depo at this time.  We'll continue it since

8   you've indicated that you've got several hours of

9   direct, and I've got a couple more hours to go on

10   my questioning.

11             I know you don't have your calendar in

12   front of you.  I don't have mine in front of me.

13   Why don't we touch base tomorrow and see when we

14   can do this.

15             MR. KREINER:  Okay.  I will  we can go

He has made scientific presentations to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, the Massachusetts Department of PubHc Health, the Texas Department of Health, Health Canada, the FTC, ISO, and the Provincial Government of British Columbia.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds' scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds' laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds* efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, IARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including

ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a manufacturing standpoint. He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including: filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s); cigarette paper bum promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds' cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar"' products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five

decades. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive '*tar" yields down by designing low "tar' and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the yeaTs. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' development of innovative cigarette designs, mcluding tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg "tar," 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yield-ui-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health

issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

9.            Defendant Vector Group Ltd, Inc. (fJkJz Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc.) ("Vector") is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the Stale of Florida and has its principal place of business in Miami, Dade County, Florida, making it a Florida citizen.

10.          Liggett, Brooke Group, Ltd.> Inc., ("BGL31) and Brooke (iroup Holding, Inc., ("BGir) were defendants in the Engle class action. The class was estimated to include several hundred thousand class members seeking damages ageunsi Defendants, including Liggett and BGL. On July 7,1999, after a lengthy jury trial in what is known as "Phase 1" of the case, the jury found Liggett and BGL liable to the class, exposing them to substantial judgments for compensatory and punitive damages.

it. In September and October 1999, Defendants Liggett and BGL undertook a sham reorganization of BGL that involved the creation of several new holding companies, multiple mergers, acquisitions, and the shuffling of BGL's assets, including Liggett, in an attempt to mislead or defraud creditors, including Engle class members and the Plaintiff herein, and/or to improperly divert revenues and assets of Liggett and BGL. This sham reorganization established Vector as the parent of BGH and Liggett (n/k/a Liggett Group, LLC).

12.          These transactions were the product of an actual intent on the part of these Defendants to hinder, delay, or defraud creditorsvin violation of Florida's Ur_iform Fraudulent Tninsfer Act.

13.          In addition to the reorganization and transfer of assets described above, the management, officers, directors, personnel, location of operation, assets, liabilities, business operations, and stockholders of BGL remained the same when the name was changed to Vector;

nominal consideration was involved in the reorganization; the vast majority of Liggett's revenues continue to be diverted to Vector to fund Vector's cigarette operations; and Bennett S. LeBow, Ihrough Vector, continued after the reorganization to exercise unilateral control over the assets of BGL and '.BGH (including the asset Liggett), as he had with the predecessor entities.

14.          Vector therefore is the successor to the original cigarette manufacturer, Liggett, which changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd., Inc. ("BGL"). Vector is a successor to BGL as a mere cc^tmuatiou of BGL and Liggett. Vector is a successor to BQL by way of de facto merger with BGL. Vector also is a successor to BGH.

15.          Vector is but Engle Defendant BGL (f/k/a Liggett Grotip, Inc., flk/a Liggett & Myers, Inc. f/k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.) by another name.

16.          Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is a mere instrumentality and/or alter ego cf Vector. Assets and profits of Liggett have been, and continue to be, improperly diverted from Liggett and BGL in an effort to mislead or defraud creditors, and/or hide assets of Liggett and BGL, Irom cre<_itorsr including Plaintiff herein, and for other improper purposes.

17.          Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is the agent of Vector and m-oiifests no separate corporate interests of its own. Vector acknowledges Liggett as its agent for purposes including, but not limited to, the sale, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Liggett has accepted by act or word to be the agent of Vector and acquiesced in the control exercised over it by Vector. Vector father exercises control over Liggett through the formation of Liggett Vector Brands, Inc., a company controlled by Vector, which now has taken over the sales and marketing of both Vector Tobacco, Lie, and Liggett.

CASE NO. 50 2009 CA 0040042 XXXX MB (Al)

18.          Joinder of Vector as a party defendant is not "fraudulent", within the meaning of decisions interpreting 2S U.S.C.  1441. In remanding a substantially identical action to state court after it was removed to the United States District Court, Judge James Lawrence King held, "Plaintiffs have laid out a reasonable argument that Vector is a liable successor.., . Plaintiffs have established a possibility that Vector controls [Defendant] Liggett and is liable as Liggett's alter ego.... It is possible that a state court will, find a cause of action ag_unst Vector." Miller, etal v. R J. Reynolds, et al, 07-212274 (S.D. Fla. Aug 17,2007). Other judges throughout the Southern District of Florida agree with this conclusion. See _5rowi v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.t No. 07-60432-CIV-MIDDLEBROOKS (S.D. Ha. Aug. 22,2007); Alonso v. JM Reynolds Tobacco Co., No, 07-22252^CIV-KiNG (S.D, Fla. Sep 11,2007); Ross v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 97-2225!-CIV-XING (SU, Ha. Sep. 11, 2007)- Davis v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22308-CIV-MORENO(S.D. Fla. Sep. 25, 2007); Caprio v.fLJ, Reynolds Tobacco Co., No; G7-20712-CIV-JORDAN (S.D. Fla. Sep. 28,2007); Ellis v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-2150'i-CIV HIGHSMiTH (S.D. Fla. Oct. 2,2007). Accordingly, no basis for the removal of this action to the United States District Court exists because the United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.

19.       The Council for Tobacco Research U:S.A., Inc. (the "Council") and the Tobacco Institute, Inc. (the "Institute''), at all times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United States both in connection with and on behalf of the Defendants.

20.          The Decedent purchased, smoked, and was addicted to cigarette products containing nicotine which were the subject of Engle. Tne cigarette products containing nicotine were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by Defendants at all material times.

At all times relevant to this action, the Smoker was a Honda resident and citizen (1) who was addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were designed, manufactured, advertised and marketed by all of the Defendants and (2) who did so in sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time period to cause injury in the fonn of diseases and medical conditions described herein, which was caused by her addiction to cigarettes that contained nicotine, and which manifested during the class period, specifically including, but not limited to, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

b.      Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

c.      All Defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

d.      All Defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known o: available, knowing that the material was- false or misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

c. All Defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive r_ature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment.

I     All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.

CASE NO. 50 2009 CA 0940042 XXXX MB (Al)

g.    Ail Defendants sold or supplied ciprettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of fact mace by Defendants.

h. All Defendants were negligent 29. As a direct and proximate result of the Decedent's addiction to smoking Defendants' cigarettes, the Decedent suffered bodily injury and died. Defendants' cigarettes caused the Decedent to develop one or more cigarette-related diseases or medical conditions that resulted in or substantially contributed to the Decedent's death. Plaintiff claims all damages allowed by the Florida Wrongful Death Act including the following: as a direct and proximate result of Plaintiffs Decedent's death, Decedent's survivors have and will suffer mental and emotional pain and suffering, have muurred medical and financial expenses, loss of the Dea_denf s love, affection, support, services, protection, aimpamonship, instruction, guidance, and funeral expenses. The Decedent's Estate has also suffered a loss of net accumulations, earnings, and medical and funeral expenses.

; 30. In the event the Defendants contend that trie. Decedent died of some cause unrelated to smoking cigarettes, Plaintiff asserts a claim for survival damages pursuant to Section 46.021, Florida Statutes, as the Decedent suffered past physical and mental and emotional pain and sutTering, loss of enjoyment of life and medical expense for care and treatment. Erring the period before the Decedent died and in conjunction with an alternative survival claim, Plaintiff al30 asserts a loss of consortium claim and alleges as a direct and proximate result of the allegations contained in. this Complaint, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer the loss of services, consortium, and care and comfort of the Decedent's society because of his injuries, disabilities and death, and has incurred expenses for medical treatment rendered to the Decedent

CASE NO. 50 2009 CA 0040042 XXXX MB (AT)

31.       Alternatively, should it be determined that Plaintiff docs not have Engle class member status, Plaintiff asserts an alternative non-Engle claim for damages pursuant to Florida's Wrongful Death Act, Plaintiffs non-Engle claim is made as an alternative claim in the event that the Decedent is not determined to be an Engle class member. The Decedent, Helen Cohen, was diagnosed with lung cancer on March 7, 2006 and died on March 11, 2006. In connection with this alternative claim, Plaintiff claims the decedent died from lung cancer caused by smoking cigarettes manufactured by these DcfendantSv 'The initial wrongful death lawsuit alleging that cigarettes were the cause of the decedents death was filed on December 21,2007, wliich is within 4 (four) years of the date of the diagnosis of lung cancer and within 2 (two) years of the date of the death of the decedent. Similar alternative claims also have been successfully raised, plead, and tried to verdict in other Engle progeny cases in Florida.

32.       Whether part of a wrongful death or survival claim, the Decedenfs cigarette-related illnesses resulted in her sustaining aggravation of previously existing conditions, physical pain and-stiffcring, mental and emotional diirtress, and meaTcal experae,

33.       Th- Plaintiffs Decedent may bear some measure of fault, but less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing her respective smoking-related injuries and death. The Plaintiff s Decedent's acts or omissions relating to the frequency and duration of her efforts to quit smoking may have been a partial proximate cause, in c&mbinatic^w^ oraissiorjs of Defendants, of her injuries, The PiainlitT therefore may seek apportionment of fault and damages between the Decedent's survivors and Estate, and each Defendant who is responsible for damages on ali Counts other than those alleging intentional torts.

34.       Venue is proper in this Circuit because, at all times material to this action, the Smoker either resided, suffered injuries or died in Palm Beach County, Florida.

It is overly broad because, at a minimum, the identification of every publication Decedent ever "read1' is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
