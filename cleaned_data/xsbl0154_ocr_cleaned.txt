2     having been duly sworn, was examined and testified

3     under oath as follows:

4                         DIRECT EXAMINATION

5     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

6          Q.  Good morning.  Is it "mister" or "doctor"?

7          A.  "Mister."   I don't have a doctorate's.

8          Q.  Good morning.

9          A.  Good morning.

10          Q.  My name is Matt Schultz.  I'm a lawyer with

11     the Levin Papantonio firm in Pensacola, Florida,

12     representing the estate and survivors of Mr. Laveon

13     Walden.  You are familiar with the Walden case?

14          A.  That's what I'm here to talk about today.  Yes,

15     sir, I'm familiar with it.

16              MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we find out who's going to

17     be on record for the parties, please.

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Ursula Henninger for Reynolds

19     Tobacco Company.

20              MR. SCHULTZ:  Rafael Cruz-Alvarez just called

21     in.  I guess he is of record for Philip Morris.

22     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

23          Q.  Let me start, Mr. Adams.

24              You are an executive vice president and CFO of

25     Reynolds American, Inc.; is that right?pgNbr=4
5

1          A.  That's correct, as well as Reynolds American

2     Services as of January the 1st of 2010.

3          Q.  Okay.  Now, a little bit later I will probably

4     kind of have you map out an organizational chart for me.

5     But can you tell me right now the relationship between

6     RAI and Reynolds American Services.

7          A.  RAI, or Reynolds American, is the parent

8     company and Reynolds American Services is a service

9     company that was established in the beginning of this

10     year.  And it's a company that has in it the treasury,

11     and disbursements, and our accounting group and our

12     planning group.

13              And they serve to provide services for many

14     Reynolds American operating companies.  And so their time

15     and their charges are apportioned out.

16               (Phone interruption).

17              MR. SCHULTZ:  I apologize.  This is Rafael

18     calling.  We might want to go off the record for a

19     second.

20               (Recess taken).

21              MR. SCHULTZ:  Back on the record.

22     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

23          Q.  Now, Mr. Adams, RAI is the parent company to

24     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

25          A.  That's correct.pgNbr=5
1          Q.  Is RAI the sole shareholder of R.J. Reynolds

2     Tobacco Company?

3          A.  Yes, it is.

4          Q.  Does that mean that no individual person owns

5     stock in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

6          A.  That's also correct.

7          Q.  Are you -- I take it by your appearance 

8     authorized to speak on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

9     Company on the subjects for which you've been designated

10     in this case?

11              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

12              But go ahead and answer.

13          A.  Yes, I am.

14          Q.  Due to a shortcoming on our end, Mr. Adams, I

15     don't have a copy of your deposition notice for you at

16     the moment.  I do want to ask you at this point,

17     however, whether you brought any documents in response

18     to Exhibit "A" to the deposition notice, which I will

19     mark once we have it in your possession.

20              Did you bring any documents this morning?

21          A.  (No response).

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, I brought in a list of

23     cases that he's testified in within the last five years.

24     And I think that was responsive to your notice.  And not

25     having it in front of me, I think everything else youpgNbr=6
1     already have, but he did bring some materials today.

2          A.  Would you like me to identify those materials?

3          Q.  Yeah.  Maybe, if you would, just walk through

4     what you have and identify it for us.

5          A.  I have the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and

6     Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements for 2009

7     and 2008, which I believe you have seen, Mr. Schultz.

8     I also have the 

9          Q.  That's correct.

10          A.  I also have 

11          Q.  That's all right.  Go ahead.

12          A.  Okay.  I also have the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

13     Company and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial

14     Statements for December of 2008 and 2007.

15          Q.  Any other documents?

16          A.  Yes.  I have three exhibits or, I guess,

17     exhibits from Mr. Johnson's deposition; one -- there are

18     two letters that Mr. Johnson or he and his associates

19     wrote to you, Mr. Schultz.  One -- both of those are

20     dated April 30th.  It appears that the shorter of the

21     two documents is an addendum to the financial condition

22     report, the thicker document.

23              And then there's a separate document  it

24     looks to be with four pages with some handwriting on

25     the front about RJRT, maybe RJR estimated market value.pgNbr=7
8

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, just so the record is

2     clear, those were Exhibits 2 and Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 8

3     to the Johnson deposition.

4              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  Let me ask you, Ursula,

5     if you recall -- and it may be an odd question, but

6     Exhibit 3 to your deposition of Mr. Johnson, did that

7     address only Philip Morris or only RJR?

8              MS. HENNINGER:  Exhibit 3 was the first letter

9     he wrote before he had the financials, and that's RAI

10     and Philip Morris.  And then he said Exhibit 2, which

11     was the one that he intended to use for Reynolds

12     Tobacco.

13              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  Good.  So that's the one

14     that we will be interested in today.

15     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

16          Q.  And any other documents, Mr. Adams?

17          A.  Yes.  I brought the proxy statement for

18     Reynolds American for 2010.  That's a public document.

19     And then I brought the Reynolds American 10-Ks for 2009,

20     2008 and 2007.  Those are, obviously, all public

21     documents.

22          Q.  And are those materials that you relied upon

23     for the testimony that you intend to give?

24          A.  Yes, I will rely upon on those, depending upon

25     what questions you ask me.pgNbr=8
9

1          Q.  Do you have any other documents?

2          A.  No, other documents, sir.

3              Oh, excuse me.  Yes.  I brought a supplemental

4     expert disclosure.

5          Q.  Okay.  We will work on attaching a couple of

6     these documents a little bit later.  I want to go ahead

7     and ask you some basic questions before we talk about

8     the documents, though.

9          A.  Oh, Mr. Schultz, excuse me.  There is one other

10     document.  I brought our corporate social responsibility

11      excuse me, the Reynolds American Corporate Social

12     Responsibility Report for 2010.

13          Q.  How many pages is that?

14          A.  It's 33 pages.

15              MR. SCHULTZ:  Is there any way, Ursula, that

16     somebody can e-mail an electronic copy of that during

17     the deposition so I can take a look at it during the

18     break?

19              MS. HENNINGER:  Yes, at the break I can ask

20     the Womble folks if they can do that.

21              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  Thanks.

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Unless you want me to break

23     now, but otherwise 

24              MR. SCHULTZ:  No.  That's fine.

25     BY MR. SCHULTZ:pgNbr=9
10

1          Q.  When is the first time, Mr. Adams, that

2     Reynolds American, Inc. issued a corporate

3     responsibilities book or position statement?

4          A.  Corporate social responsibilities, Mr. Schultz?

5          Q.  Right.  Isn't that the title that you just

6     gave me?

7          A.  The Corporate Social Responsibility Report,

8     yes.  I believe the first time we issued it was in 2004

9     or 2005.

10          Q.  And, what, generally, does that -- is the

11     subject matter of the Corporate Responsibilities Report?

12          A.  Generally, the subject matter is how we conduct

13     ourselves as  again, when I say "we," I mean Reynolds

14     American conducts itself as a corporate citizen.  And it

15     includes a number of different areas, or we call them

16     "planks," three of which are specific to tobacco

17     companies.

18              And then the other four are more, I guess,

19     relevant to basically commercial companies.  The three

20     that are specific to tobacco companies and to us  to

21     Reynolds Tobacco -- are harm reduction and product

22     integrity, youth tobacco prevention and responsible

23     consumer and customer engagement.  Those are more tobacco

24     specific.

25              The ones that are more general to otherpgNbr=10
11

1     commercial companies  which we also embrace  are

2     employee responsibility, community and civic engagement,

3     supplier responsibility and environmental sustainability

4          Q.  Does the  you told me that this was an RAI

5     document?  Does it govern or control R.J. Reynolds

6     Tobacco Company as well?

7          A.  I don't know that I would say it "governs" or

8     "controls."  I mean, I think it sets guidelines out that

9     the companies generally will follow.  I mean, these are

10     how we conduct our businesses and, yes, R.J. Reynolds

11     Tobacco Company would follow these as well.

12          Q.  And they are  I take it -- how you conduct

13     your companies, because they are what you deem to be the

14     socially responsible way in which to conduct a company,

15     correct?

16              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

17          A.  This is how we believe we should conduct our

18     corporate affairs.

19          Q.  Right.

20              And my question is:  Isn't it true that the

21     reason that you believe that's how you should govern

22     your corporate affairs is because that's the socially

23     responsible way to govern yourselves as a tobacco

24     company that's reflected in this document, correct?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.pgNbr=11
12

1          A.  It is reflected in this document, and it's

2     meant to reflect how all of our operating companies would

3     conduct their businesses, not just Reynolds Tobacco.

4          Q.  Right.  I understand.

5              The three planks specific to tobacco

6     companies, would the guidelines set out in any three of

7     those apply to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and what

8     would be a socially responsible way to govern itself in

9     the 1950s as equally as they do today?

10              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

11          A.  Well, it may, but there are different products

12     now that Reynolds Tobacco has, such as its dissolvable

13     tobacco products, it's Snuz.  And there's different rules

14     and regulations today that apply to these businesses than

15     did back in the fifties.

16          Q.  Well, let's be a little more specific.

17              Regarding harm reduction and product

18     integrity, are there any guidelines contained in the

19     book that you brought to this deposition that you

20     believe did not apply to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

21     during the period of 1945 to the period in which

22     Reynolds American first issued this corporate

23     responsibility statement?

24              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

25          A.  Well, I'm sure there are, Mr. Schultz.  And,pgNbr=12
13

1     you know, I wasn't here in 1945 and 1950.  In fact, I

2     wasn't born then.  So I'm sure that there were some

3     different circumstances that occurred back then.

4          Q.  Okay.  Why don't you help me understand the

5     differences.  Help me understand what aspect of the harm

6     reduction plank as set out in the 2010 guidelines should

7     not have applied to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

8     during the period of 1940s through 2004 and 2005.

9          A.  Well, some of the information that's in harm

10     reduction talks about different types of tobacco products

11     other than cigarettes.  And such as  these things

12     aren't necessarily called out specifically, but Snuz and

13     moist snuff products.  And those things really weren't

14     discussed.  I mean, I have a difficult time telling you

15     what was discussed and what wasn't discussed back in the

16     forties and the fifties since  well, I was alive at the

17     time, but I was  at least from 1950 forward.

18              I really wasn't, you know, aware of the types

19     of things that were going on in the tobacco business at

20     that time.  I don't have personal knowledge of that back

21     then.

22          Q.  So if we take out the guidelines that can

23     apply or do, in fact, apply only to products that R.J.

24     Reynolds Tobacco Company did not manufacture during the

25     time period that I've asked you about, we take that outpgNbr=13

1     and set it aside, are there any other guidelines in the

2     harm reduction or product integrity planks of your

3     current corporate responsibility statement that you

4     believe should not have applied equally to R.J. Reynolds

5     Tobacco Company for the 60 years before this report was

6     first issued?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Do you want him to

8     go through -- I know you don't have it, Matt.  But do

9     you want him to go through the three or four or

10     five pages that compose this harm reduction plank that

11     he talked about?

12              MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  Well, I want to know if

13     there is any one of these guidelines that's discussed in

14     here on harm reduction or product integrity that he

15     believes, or the company believes, did not apply to it

16     or should not have applied to it during the forties,

17     fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties or nineties.

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

19              Take your time.  Go through it.

20          A.  Okay.  Well, let me just speak a little bit to

21     harm reduction and product integrity, Mr. Schultz.  Maybe

22     we can kind of work our way through this.

23              The objectives are to ensure that nothing is

24     done or added to tobacco products that increases its

25     inherent risks.  We also talk about developing andpgNbr=14
15

1     producing products that will potentially reduce the

2     inherent risks of tobacco use, or potentially reduce

3     exposure to reported toxicants with particular tobacco

4     product categories.  And that's the one that I think

5     relates to things other than cigarettes.

6              And then also promote, as appropriate,

7     migration to products with lower relative risks, either

8     within or across tobacco product categories.  And, again,

9     I don't think some of those products actually existed

10     in the fifties, sixties, seventies and even into the

11     eighties.  So I think we're trying to compare  I mean,

12     we're comparing apples and oranges here.  There's

13     different circumstances today in terms of product

14     availability and, frankly, acceptability such as in the

15     moist snuff category compared to  I mean, based on my

16     knowledge  what was out there in the fifties and

17     sixties.

18              Even you look back at cigarettes, I mean, back

19     in the forties and fifties, I recall  and I recall this

20     from reading  is that there were -- filtered cigarettes

21     were not available.  In fact, I think they were

22     introduced -- I could have my facts wrong here -- either

23     in the late fifties -- I think it was in the fifties that

24     filtered cigarettes were first introduced.

25              So, I mean, there have been a lot of changespgNbr=15
16

1     in the tobacco business over the years.  And from the

2     forties over this time frame that you're asking about 

3     and it's just a bit difficult to sit here and tell you

4     what changed when and make those comparisons about 

5          Q.  Right.

6          A.   how different -- you know, are there

7     differences in our approach today versus differences in,

8     let's just say, in the fifties because there was actually

9     a different understanding about tobacco today than there

10     was then.

11          Q.  What was different?  What do you have

12     specifically in mind when you say "there's a different

13     understanding about tobacco today than there was in the

14     1950s"?

15          A.  Well, I mean, for instance, the warnings on

16     packs.  I don't believe that there were warnings on packs

17     in the fifties.  I believe they came in 1967 or 1968.

18     The Surgeon General warnings is what I'm talking about.

19     So there are those differences and there are  you know,

20     there's a  and I think while there's always been an

21     awareness of harm or  you know, the harm that may be

22     caused by tobacco products, I think that there is a

23     greater awareness today than there was back in the

24     fifties.

25          Q.  Let me focus in on specifically the statementpgNbr=16
17

1     you made regarding "not doing anything to or adding

2     anything to tobacco that would increase the inherent

3     risks."  Again, that is  you would agree with me 

4     a socially responsible guideline that is appropriate

5     for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company today, correct?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  Yeah.  We believe that we shouldn't add  you

8     know, nothing is done or added to tobacco products that

9     increases its inherent risks.

10          Q.  Right.

11              So let's take that specific guideline, and let

12     me ask you whether that also should have been  and

13     perhaps you will tell me it was -- a guideline that

14     governed R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's corporate

15     conduct during the period of the 1940s to the early

16     2000s?

17          A.  You know, actually, I'm not aware, and I don't

18     know what governed the view of this by the company, by

19     the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, back in the forties

20     through today.  I can tell you that some of the things

21     that have been discovered more recently such as tobacco-

22     specific nitrosamines or TSNAs is when there became an

23     awareness.  And I'm not  I believe that the awareness

24     was  there was a discovery by our R and D people that

25     TSNAs increased the potential risk in tobacco products.pgNbr=17
18

1              We, as a matter of product stewardship, you

2     know, began removing those types of tobaccos.  And it was

3     largely how those tobaccos were cured from the tobaccos

4     that we put into our products.  That occurred, I believe,

5     in the late nineties, the mid to late nineties.

6              So I just don't know whether that type of

7     scientific knowledge existed in the fifties.  I mean,

8     that's just an example.  There's probably lots of --

9     there's probably other examples as well.

10          Q.  How long have you been with an Reynolds-

11     affiliated company, personally?

12          A.  I became employed by the company in 1999.

13          Q.  Has it been the company's public position

14     since 1999 that nothing should be done to or added to

15     tobaccos or cigarettes that would increase the inherent

16     risks of smoking?

17          A.  I don't know that it was its public position,

18     but I do know that the product stewardship aspect, this

19     one that I'm speaking about, the TSNA, actually preceded

20     the corporate social responsibility that we began

21     reporting in 2004 or 2005.  So said differently:  I don't

22     know if we were publicly speaking about it, but we were

23     doing it.  We were trying to make these products less

24     harmful.

25          Q.  Is there a description -- and perhaps thispgNbr=18
19

1     will be easier to do once I have a copy of this.  But on

2     the youth tobacco prevention plank, is there a shorthand

3     or a one- or two-sentence description setting forth the

4     company's position in that regard contained in that

5     report?

6          A.  There's a couple of sentences.  I will read

7     them to you, if I may.  It says:  "Develop and support

8     programs to limit youth access to and use of tobacco

9     products."  And the second one is:  "To partner

10     effectively with external stakeholders to expand

11     adoption of youth tobacco prevention programs."

12          Q.  Okay.  Who are the external stakeholders

13     referred to in that statement?

14          A.  Well, we have used a program that we developed,

15     "Right Decisions Right Now," and have taken that to

16     schools here in the United States and notably in this

17     report in Puerto Rico.  We have also an expanded tobacco

18     awareness  and this is not in this report -- to the Boy

19     Scouts and have it part of a prevention program within

20     the Boy Scouts that we're doing.

21              So the external stakeholders are those groups

22     that may represent and influence youth to not begin using

23     tobacco products.

24          Q.  Okay.  Would that include governmental public

25     health authorities?pgNbr=19
20

1          A.  We have actually spoken to them.  I mean, our

2     "Right Decisions Right Now" and tobacco-free program was

3     validated by the federal authorities, by the Federal

4     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

5      the acronym for that is SAMHSA  as an evidenced-

6     based youth tobacco prevention program.  And, as a

7     result, they earned us a place in SAMHSA's national

8     registry of evidence-based programs and practices.

9              And that basically validates that some of the

10     things that we are doing are actually having an impact

11     or should have  either having or should have an impact

12     on youth not smoking or using tobacco products.

13          Q.  So R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company today takes

14     the position that it is its corporate responsibility to

15     limit youth access to and the use of tobacco products,

16     correct?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  Yes.  We don't want youth to begin using --

19              MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry, Mr. Adams.

20              Hang on.  What's the objection?

21              MS. HENNINGER:  You indicated that Reynolds

22     Tobacco Company takes the position.  I think we have

23     already established that this is a Reynolds American

24     document, not that it doesn't have applicability.  But

25     I was objecting to the phrasing of your question forpgNbr=20
21

1     that reason.

2          Q.  Okay.  You can respond, Mr. Adams.  Thank you.

3          A.  Well, Reynolds American and, actually, most of

4     these activities are carried out by Reynolds Tobacco.

5     So, therefore, I would say it is embracing that this

6     particular plank believes that youths should not use

7     tobacco.

8          Q.  Right.

9              My question was different and tried to track

10     the language that you read to me.  And that is

11     specifically:  "R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company feels that

12     today it is its corporate responsibility to limit use,

13     access to and use of tobacco products," true?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Same objection.  Go ahead.

15          A.  Yes.  That's true.

16          Q.  Was that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's

17     position, if you know, during the period of the 1940s

18     through the point in which this Corporate

19     Responsibilities Report was first published?

20          A.  I actually don't know about those early

21     periods, Mr. Schultz.

22          Q.  Okay.  Do you agree with me that it would have

23     been still the responsible thing to do to limit youth

24     access to and use of tobacco products to the extent that

25     it could do so?pgNbr=21
22

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

2          A.  Well, it was the -- I believe it is the

3     responsible thing to do.  And I do know that prior to

4     issuing a Corporate Responsibility Report, we have

5     actually been engaged in that as part of the requirements

6     of signing the Master Settlement Agreement in 1999.

7     There were youth tobacco measures that, I believe, are

8     promulgated by that agreement.

9          Q.  And how about before signing of the MSA?  That

10     was still the responsible manner in which one would run

11     a tobacco company, correct; that being specifically

12     doing what you can to limit youth access to and use of

13     tobacco products?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  There may been efforts to reduce tobacco use

16     before 1999.  I'm just not familiar with what those might

17     have been.

18          Q.  When you use the term "youth" in this

19     document, what does that mean?

20          A.  People that can legally purchase tobacco

21     products.  I think the minimum age in states is 18.

22          Q.  Let me ask you, Mr. Adams; beyond describing

23     the relationship between RAI and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

24     Company and, of course, you mentioned the fact that you

25     worked for RAI, what do you intend to discuss regardingpgNbr=22
23

1     Reynolds American, Inc. in the trial of the Walden case?

2          A.  Well, I will talk about Reynolds American's

3     relationship to Reynolds Tobacco, who's the defendant

4     in this case.  And to the extent that there are

5     interrelationships between the two, and there are a lot

6     in terms of  I mean, financial interrelationships.  I

7     would and I may speak to the differences between Reynolds

8     American  and, again, I'm speaking financially now --

9     between that and Reynolds Tobacco.

10          Q.I guess you tuned into the focus of my

11     question, or what prompted it.  And that's this:  The

12     defendant in this case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

13     If the jury  if we reach a punitive damages phase 

14     will be concerned only with awarding damages against

15     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

16              So I guess my question is geared toward, for

17     example, mentioning RAI shareholders.  Do you have any

18     intention to do that?

19              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

20          A.  I may, yes, mention RAI shareholders.

21          Q.  And in what context would you foresee yourself

22     discussing RAI shareholders?

23          A.  Well, to the extent that there's a judgment and

24     a payment against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the

25     shareholders of Reynolds American may be impacted by thepgNbr=23
24

1     result of such judgment and payment.

2          Q.  Would that, then, include a discussion of

3     payment of dividends or stock values of RAI?

4          A.  It may include both of those, Mr. Schultz.

5          Q.  How many employees does RAI have?

6          A.  Between two and 300, I believe.

7          Q.  And how about RJRT?

8          A.  Probably about four to 5,000.  I'm giving you

9     rough numbers because I don't have those exact numbers,

10     but I believe that's directionally correct.

11          Q.  Yeah.  That's fine.

12              How long has RAI existed?

13          A.  RAI has existed since 2004.

14          Q.  And how long has R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

15     existed?

16              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

17          A.  As a corporate entity, I think Reynolds has

18     existed since 1875.  Now, I don't know if it was exactly

19     called the "R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company," but I believe

20     it was.  But it was founded in 1875.

21          Q.  Now, we've done some discovery of Philip

22     Morris, RAI's codefendant in this case.  And they have a

23     policy regarding -- I'll say what they refer to as cash

24     sweeps coming in and siphoning off, if you will, income

25     from P.M. USA in the form of dividends paid over topgNbr=24
25

1     Altria.  And they have a written cash management policy,

2     as I understand it, that governors that.

3              I say that by preface of the question of

4     whether RAI has a similar written policy by which

5     dividends are paid on some routine or recurring basis

6     from RJRT to RAI?

7              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Objection to the form.

8          A.  I'm not aware that we have a policy like that,

9     Mr. Schultz.  I'm not saying that one doesn't exist.  I'm

10     not aware that we have a policy that talks about, you

11     know, routinely doing dividends or loans or anything like

12     that; "we" being Reynolds American.

13          Q.  How is it determined  assuming it happens

14     the same way every time  well, what dividends will be

15     paid from RJRT to its sole shareholder, RAI?

16          A.  I think what happens is that we determine the

17     cash needs of Reynolds American from time to time.  And

18     we look to the various operating companies that we have;

19     and those would be Reynolds Tobacco, Santa Fe Natural

20     Tobacco Company and the American Snuff Company.  And then

21     we determine, you know, what amounts of money that we

22     need from, you know, any or each of those, and then

23     determine whether those amounts should come in the way of

24     dividends or loans.

25              Reynolds American doesn't have any operations.pgNbr=25
26

1     It does pay dividends.  It does contribute moneys to the

2     pension plans for all of the covered plans, which would

3     be Reynolds Tobacco and Puerto Rico and others.  And it

4     also has to make debt payments from time to time, both

5     interest expense and payments, against the debt for the

6     $4.3 billion of debt that Reynolds American has.

7              So those  and, in addition, there's other

8     requirements as well for salaries and things like that.

9     So Reynolds American has a need for cash, and that cash

10     comes from its operating companies of which Reynolds

11     Tobacco is one and is the largest.

12          Q.  And the most lucrative?

13          A.  When you say "the most lucrative," what do you

14     mean?

15          Q.  The one that brings in the most money.

16          A.  They make the most money of the three.  That's

17     correct.

18          Q.  Help me -- actually, this would be a good

19     time.  If I wanted to draw an organizational chart with

20     RAI at the top, I presume it would be appropriate to put

21     "RAI" at the top.  I know RJRT is underneath it.  Who

22     else is on the same level as RJRT?

23          A.  The American Snuff Company.  That was formerly

24     known as Conwood.  They are largely in the moist snuff

25     business.  And then the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco CompanypgNbr=26
27

1     is also on that same level, and they sell  they

2     manufacture and sell Natural American Spirit cigarettes

3     and sell cigarettes -- and they import Dunhill and State

4     Express Triple 5 cigarettes as well; they import those.

5          Q.  Okay.  And how about subsidiaries of each of

6     those three companies, if you can break those out for

7     me, if there are any?

8          A.  Well, let's start with the smallest of the

9     three.  The Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company has a  I'm

10     going to talk about operating subsidiaries as opposed to

11     legal entities.  There are lots of legal entities that

12     are  I should say there are many legal entities.  And

13     those things are structured depending upon the

14     circumstances and how we want to incorporate it into

15     various states.

16              But in terms of operating subsidiaries, the

17     Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company owns or actually manages

18     the international business for Santa Fe, and it does

19     business in Europe and in Japan.  And then the American

20     Snuff Company or Conwood, Lane, Ltd. is a subsidiary or

21     is  that business, the Lane business, is managed by the

22     American Snuff Company.

23              And then when you come to Reynolds Tobacco,

24     they manage or  they manage the business for, you know,

25     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco in Puerto Rico, and also what haspgNbr=27
28

1     formerly been Global Products, Incorporated, which is the

2     overseas and military business.  That's part of Reynolds

3     Tobacco today as well.

4          Q.  Where does Niconovum fit in?

5          A.  I believe it is owned partially by Reynolds

6     Tobacco, but the majority, I believe, is owned by

7     Reynolds Tobacco with the balance at Reynolds American.

8     And it operates in Denmark and Sweden and was acquired

9     in December of 2009.

10          Q.  It does not operate in the United States?

11          A.  No, sir, it does not.

12          Q.  And where is RAS I guess it is  fit in that

13     services company?

14          A.  Oh, I'm sorry.

15              The services company fits underneath Reynolds

16     American and there are, as I mentioned earlier -- that

17     is actually  they don't sell anything.  They actually

18     serve as just a group that more -- I was going to -- that

19     manages treasury functions, disbursement functions,

20     decision support for the various companies, the planning,

21     supply chains; those kinds of things.

22          Q.  All right.  Can you tell me, Mr. Adams, either

23     specifically or ballpark, how many punitive damage

24     verdicts R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has ever paid?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.pgNbr=28
29

1          A.  No, I can't, but those things, I believe, are

2     disclosed in our 10-K.  I don't know how many there are

3     or have been.

4          Q.  Do you know if there are more than ten?

5          A.  I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Schultz.

6     I don't believe there have been more than ten, but I

7     don't know that as a fact.

8          Q.  Okay.  How about how many punitive damage

9     verdicts has R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company paid since

10     1999 when you became affiliated with the Reynolds

11     family?

12          A.  I don't know.  I would have to refer to the

13     document and tell you.  When I say "the document," I mean

14     the 10-K.  I just haven't added them up.

15          Q.  Tell me the last punitive damages verdict that

16     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company paid that had some

17     untoward or deleterious effect on the dividends paid out

18     by Reynolds American to its shareholders.

19              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

20          A.  Well, they all have an effect on the amount.  I

21     mean, anything that we pay out has somewhat of an effect.

22     Now, if we altered the -- we haven't altered the

23     dividends that we paid out.  But they all have an effect

24     on the overall cash that is in the company.

25          Q.  Okay.  My question was about the dividends.pgNbr=29
30

1     Did you say they haven't altered the amount of dividends

2     that you've paid out?

3          A.  No, our dividends have been consistent over the

4      it's been consistent.

5          Q.  Right.

6              I'm not asking you if the dividends are

7     consistent.  I want to be very specific.  I'm asking --

8     if I understood you correctly, there has never been an

9     instance, to your knowledge, in which an R.J. Reynolds

10     Tobacco Company payment of a punitive damages verdict

11     altered the amount of dividends paid by RAI to its

12     shareholders?

13              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

14          A.  I mean, if the question is, did we change our

15     dividends as a result of the punitive damages payment,

16     the answer to that is, no, we have not.  No, we have not

17     to this point.

18          Q.  Okay.  You told me a few minutes ago you could

19     imagine or could foresee  I think was the word that I

20     used in my question -- testimony regarding the manner in

21     which, or the fact that a punitive damage verdict might

22     affect the shareholders of RAI.

23              In what ways might a substantial punitive

24     damage verdict against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

25     affect the shareholders of RAI?pgNbr=30
31

1          A.  Well, depending upon the amount of the punitive

2     damages, and we're talking theoretically here.  Depending

3     upon the amount of the punitive damage award, it could,

4     you know, use up cash that would otherwise be going to

5     pay dividends to RAI's shareholders.  The other thing

6     that could happen is that it actually could influence

7     the filing of more cases against the company and could

8     influence the judgment and results of other juries that

9     are out in the marketplace as these things become widely

10     known.

11          Q.  Okay.  Can you give me an example of a

12     punitive damage verdict that was entered against RJR

13     that resulted in larger subsequent verdicts or

14     additional lawsuits against the company?

15              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.

16          A.  No, I can't do that, because there -- I don't

17     know that there have been that many judgments or

18     payments.  Excuse me.  And I don't know the number of

19     cases sitting here right now.

20          Q.  Okay.  So why wouldn't that 

21          A.  Well, let me stop you for a second here, and

22     just say that I know that the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

23     Company has made payments.  And you asked me specifically

24     about punitive payments.  I know we made some payments.

25     I just don't know the relative  how much of thosepgNbr=31
32

1     particular payments were punitive, and how much of those

2     were compensatory in nature.

3              And so I'm not trying to evade your question,

4     Mr. Schultz.  I'm just trying to answer it accurately.

5     And I do know that we have made payments, and I'm going

6     to restate and say this again.  I just don't know the

7     balance or the differences between compensatory and

8     punitives within those payments that we have made, that

9     "we" Reynolds Tobacco has made.

10          Q.  Right.

11              And at any time there is a reason to make a

12     distinction, I would like for you to do so as you did so

13     that we are communicating with one another.  And I am

14     focused on punitive damages, because that is my

15     understanding of the phase in which you would intend to

16     testify in this case.

17              And is it your understanding that you will

18     have any testimony regarding compensatory damages in

19     this case?

20          A.  I don't have an understanding about that.

21          Q.  Okay.  Do you understand that punitive damages

22     are awarded to punish companies after a jury has already

23     found that they are deserving the punishment?

24          A.  My understanding is that they are to punish and

25     to deter.pgNbr=32
33

1          Q.  That's right.

2              And is it R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's

3     position that a deleterious impact on dividends to RAI

4     shareholders is a reason not to punish or deter

5     otherwise punishable conduct?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  I don't know that that's Reynolds Tobacco's

8     position.  I think the -- I don't know that that's their

9     position.

10          Q.  Okay.  Well, I'm trying to understand why you

11     would want to tell the jury what impact a punitive

12     damage award might have on RAI shareholders.  If that's

13     not the reason, maybe you can tell me what the reason

14     would be.

15          A.  Well, I think that they  what I would like

16     the jury to understand is who I believe Reynolds Tobacco

17      excuse me, Reynolds American's shareholders, they are

18     the ones that may be impacted by a reduction or a lack

19       of dividends from Reynolds Tobacco because of a punitive 2 0              damage award.

21              So I think the jury might need to understand,

22     you know, who those shareholders might represent.

23          Q.  Right.

24              And the reason you would want the jury to

25     understand that is because you believe that it wouldpgNbr=33
34

1     have some impact on the size of the verdict they might

2     return, correct; or is there some other reason for

3     offering that testimony?

4              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

5          A.  I actually think they just need to understand

6     that, you know, that our shareholders -- I mean, we at

7     Reynolds American work for our shareholders.  And our

8     shareholders are broad based.  And it's  you know, they

9     are both  we are both retail, which means individuals,

10     and institutionally held.  And those are the people.  I

11     mean, they buy Reynolds American stock  and, for that

12     matter, other tobacco companies' stock  for the

13     dividends, apparently for the dividends.  Because, as

14     you know, Mr. Schultz, this is an industry that's been

15     declining in terms of the number of units, or the number

16     of packs of cigarettes that are sold.  And it's been

17     declining sequentially since the earlier eighties, since

18     about 1981 or 1982.

19              So one to two percent a year, some years higher

20     than that.  Last year it was more, like, down eight or

21     nine percent.  So there are  you know, this is a

22     declining business, and the way that companies attract

23     investors in the business is to pay dividends.

24          Q.  And so if the jury in the Walden case returns

25     a substantial verdict, you're telling me R.J. ReynoldspgNbr=34
35

1     Tobacco will pay less of a dividend as a result of 

2     excuse me, RAI would pay?

3          A.  It's possible.

4          Q.  Now, how many punitive damage verdicts, to

5     your knowledge, have been entered in the Engle Progeny

6     cases?  Tell me if you don't know what I mean by that

7     term.

8              MS. HENNINGER:  He's talking about entered.

9              THE WITNESS:  Right.

10          A.  Against Reynolds Tobacco  well, again, I will

11     have to look at the document.  I mean, there have been a

12     number that have been  that have been returned in 2009,

13     and in this year as well against Reynolds Tobacco and

14     against the industry, Philip Morris as well.

15          Q.  Okay.  I tried a case with one of my partners

16     this time last year.  We had a $25 million punitive

17     damage verdict against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

18              Did RAI pay out less of a dividend to its

19     shareholders as a result of that $25 million punitive

20     damage verdict?

21          A.  That was actually 

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

23          A.  I think there was a judgment entered; at this

24     point that case, I believe, is on appeal.  I believe it

25      was that the Martin case?pgNbr=35
36

1          Q.  That's correct.

2              So the answer to my question would be --

3          A.  No.  I mean, we didn't alter our dividend,

4     because it's an adjustment at this point, and it wasn't

5     paid.  It was appealed, and I believe we will post  if

6     we haven't already done so  an appeals bond to appeal

7     the verdict in that case.

8          Q.  And would you foresee  if tomorrow you were

9     ordered by the Court to pay over the $25 million, would

10     you predict that that would have an impact on the

11     dividends paid out by RAI to its shareholders?

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

13          A.  It would certainly figure into the amount of

14     money that we could pay.

15          Q.  Right.

16              What's your best guess?  You're the CFO of the

17     company.  Do you think that it would impact dividends or

18     not?

19          A.  It would impact it.  Now, whether we would

20     change the amount that we paid out is another story.

21          Q.  I'm sorry.  I think I've asked this.  I want

22     to make sure that I understand this.

23              As we sit here today, you don't know the

24     number of punitive damage verdicts paid out by Reynolds

25     Tobacco during your tenure with the Reynolds family ofpgNbr=36
37

1     companies?

2          A.  I haven't calculate that, Mr. Schultz.  I can

3     get that information.  I just don't have that at my

4     fingertips.

5              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, just let me interrupt.

6     Some of my objections  I should have made this more

7     clear  other than just to form.  You know, as a CFO of

8     the  company, he can't be sitting here guessing of

9     what's going to happen to Reynolds' stock based on some

10     things in the future.  I don't know all of the SEC

11     implications of that.

12              So I just want to make sure that he doesn't --

13     to the extent that he's not allowed or shouldn't be

14     doing something like that, or a violation of law, step

15     in right there.  Because, you know, as a CFO 

16              MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  Well, if he's going

17     to come to the courtroom, Ursula, and make predictions

18     about what a substantial punitive damages verdict would

19     do to RJRT or RAI's bottom line, then very clearly I'm

20     entitled to ask him the same questions during the

21     deposition; whether it is appropriate for him to answer,

22     I really have no idea.

23              I don't understand SEC guidelines.  I presume

24     he knows them far better than I do.  But you cannot

25     foreclose questioning and then bring out testimony atpgNbr=37
38

1     trial along the same lines.

2              MS. HENNINGER:  No.  I think he's here to talk

3     about the dividends paid in the sense that Mr. Johnson

4     uses one of those numbers, and that's why we get into

5     that area.

6              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  And maybe that will

7     become clearer when I look at Mr. Johnson's slides, and

8     that would be fine.  My understanding, perhaps erroneous

9       I hope erroneous, because we would object  is that

10     Mr. Adams 

11     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

12          Q.  And let me just pose the question to you,

13     Mr. Adams.  If Mr. Johnson doesn't have any testimony

14     regarding dividends, do you still plan to get on the

15     stand and tell the jury, look, if you hit us with a big

16     punitive damage award, that could have a deleterious

17     effect on dividends paid out to RAI's shareholders?

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

19              To the extent you know.

20          A.  I mean, if I'm asked about dividends and if

21     that comes up in the punitive  I mean, in the punitive

22     damages stage, then I would likely say something like

23     that, or I may say something like that if asked to do so.

24          Q.  Do you understand what the term "Engle

25     Progeny" case means?pgNbr=38
1          A.  Yes, I do.

2          Q.  How many Engle Progeny punitive damage

3     verdicts has Reynolds Tobacco paid?

4          A.  I don't think we paid any.  I think all of

5     those cases are either on appeal, or are going to be

6     appealed.

7          Q.  As you sit here today, are you planning on

8     identifying a specific dollar amount what you believe

9     would constitute an appropriate punitive damages award

10     if we reach that phase of the trial?

11          A.  I'm not planning to do that, no.  I think

12     that's up to the jury.

13          Q.  Do you plan to offer the jury what R.J.

14     Reynolds Tobacco Company would deem an appropriate

15     methodology by which to arrive at a number or a formula?

16          A.  No, sir, I don't plan to do that.

17          Q.  Mr. Adams, I want you to help me understand,

18     if you can, how RJRT books the verdicts that are entered

19     against it in lawsuits over smoking and health issues.

20     Maybe you can just give me a general description of what

21     principles governed how Reynolds Tobacco books the

22     money.  I'm talking specifically about profitability and

23     remoteness and all of that stuff.

24          A.  Sure.

25              Reynolds Tobacco, and actually all of thepgNbr=39
40

1     Reynolds American companies, follow what has been known

2     as financial accounting standards bulletin No. 5, which

3     talks about probabilities of contingencies.  And so we

4     record contingencies or legal judgments.  And these can

5     actually be commercial contingencies, other commercial

6     contingencies, when there are facts known about the case.

7     And when we can  when it's reasonably estimatable 

8     I'm actually just kind of searching my memory banks now

9     for the exact wording.

10              When it's probable and it's reasonably

11     estimatable, that's the wording from financial accounting

12     from FASB No. 5.  Yeah.  I mean, I think it really is.

13     So what that means is:  When something is  in the tax

14     parlance  fixed and determinable.  So, for instance 

15     well.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.

16              MS. HENNINGER:  I think he was 

17          A.  No.  I'm okay.

18          Q.  The "for instance" may help me understand.  So

19     please.

20          A.  Well, what it means is that we  if a case is

21     filed against the company -- and this is just not the way

22     Reynolds does this.  I mean, this is generally-accepted

23     accounting principles.  If a case is filed, generally

24     notice is made of that.  And unless it's remote, which

25     means that there's absolutely  there's very, verypgNbr=40
41

1     little chance of it making it through the court system,

2     you disclose the amount of cases.

3              And if you look in our financial statements --

4     we have many pages, I think close to 30 pages  in RAI's

5     annual report on its form 10-K that describe the various

6     types of cases that we're involved in.  Only when you 

7     there is  when we have exhausted all appeals, and there

8     is a final number that is known do we record a liability.

9     All of that is actually described in the footnotes to the

10     financial statements.

11               (At 10:10 a.m. Mr. Ben Shively present).

12          Q.  Do you know if any liability was recorded in

13     2009 for any lawsuit against Reynolds Tobacco, any

14     smoking and health lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

15     Company?

16          A.  Yes, there was.

17          Q.  What were those?

18          A.  There was a judgment, a final judgment, issued

19     in the Whiteley case and that was recorded.

20          Q.  And what was the amount of that?

21          A.  I believe it is $2.2 million.  If I may, is it

22     okay if I look at the document?  I can tell you exactly

23     what it is.

24          Q.  Yes.

25          A.  Okay.pgNbr=41
42

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, after he answers this,

2     or when you get to a good point, if we can take a

3     restroom break?

4              MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure.  That's fine.  If you

5     would, can you check on the exhibits, which I think have

6     been e-mailed?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Yes, I will do that on the way

8     out.

9              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

10          A.  Mr. Schultz, there's like 30 pages here.  And

11     I'm going to need to go through a few of those.  I'm

12     happy to do that on the break, and then just come back to

13     you at the conclusion of the break, or we can just  if

14     you want to sit and wait while I do this.

15          Q.  Yeah.  You don't even have  that's fine.

16     You don't even have to do that.  If it's in there, it

17     says what it says.  But Whiteley is the only liability

18     recorded from a smoking and health case that you know of

19     for 2009, correct?

20          A.  I don't know if was the only one.  I know it

21     occurred.  I think the final here  it is.  It was

22     $2.2 million, as I had suspected, and it was  the

23     California Supreme Court denied our defendant's petition

24     for review on January 13th.  And we paid -- Reynolds

25     Tobacco paid $2.2 million in February, on February thepgNbr=42
1     5th of this year.

2          Q.  Do you know whether that was compensatory,

3     punitive or both?

4          A.  I think it was both.  Let me come back to you

5     on that because Philip Morris was in this case as well.

6     So I think it was apportioned between Philip Morris and

7     Reynolds, but I will need to read a bit on this during

8     the break to answer that question, Mr. Schultz.

9              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  Why don't we do this:

10     Let's take ten minutes.  And if I can get the list of

11     cases faxed to me, that would be a big help.

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, how about if I just

13     e-mail it to you?  I think that might be easier, or is

14     it not?

15              MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes.  If you can do that, that's

16     fine.

17              MS. HENNINGER:  What's your e-mail?

18              MR. SCHULTZ:  It's mschultz  actually, send

19     it to mlycus.  That's mlycus@levinlaw.com.

20              MS. HENNINGER:  M-L-Y-C-U-S?

21              MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right.

22              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  We're taking a break?

23                  MS. HENNINGER:  Yes, for ten minutes. 2 4                                      MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Okay.

25                                (Recess taken).pgNbr=43

1              MR. SCHULTZ:  Why don't we go ahead and mark

2     the depo exhibit -- excuse me, the depo notice as

3     Exhibit 1.  Well, let's go back to Exhibit 2.

4              MS. HENNINGER:  So as Exhibit 2?

5              MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

6               (Exhibits 1 and 2 were marked for

7     identification).

8     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

9          Q.  Mr. Adams, this is a Forbes profile that I

10     pulled off the Internet of you.  Have you ever seen

11     this, by the way?

12          A.  Actually, no, I haven't.

13          Q.  I'm particularly interested  well, first of

14     all, if you would, read the paragraph to yourself.  You

15     don't have to read it aloud.  That begins with "59 years

16     old."  If you would, just read over that paragraph, and

17     just tell me if there are any statements in there that

18     are inaccurate.

19          A.  Okay.  I've read this.  It appears to be

20     accurate.

21          Q.I want to look down at the compensation and

22     ask you to review that, and tell me if that appears to

23     be accurate as well.

24          A.  Yeah.  I think these are the amounts that

25     appear in the proxy statement.  I mean, I can check that,pgNbr=44
45

1     but, yeah.  Yes, these appear to be correct.

2          Q.  Okay.  And so your total compensation for the

3     year 2009 was in the range of $3.66 million, correct?

4          A.  That's my compensation package.  That's not

5     cash compensation.

6          Q.  What was your total cash compensation for

7     2009?

8          A.  Well, I thought you might ask that.  So I

9     looked.  It was a $1,469,000.  That was what was on my

10     W-2.

11          Q.  Okay.  $1.4 million?

12          A.  Yeah.

13          Q.  So where is the other $2.2 million coming

14     from?  Can you break it down, based on the numbers that

15     appear on this profile?

16          A.  I think so.  The changes in pension values, the

17     next to the last one, the $929,000 is noncash.  Well, I

18     mean, I don't get that cash today.  Okay.  That's the

19     value that I may receive going forward as a result of the

20     pension plan  may.

21          Q.I understand.

22          A.  And then the restricted stock awards.  I

23     believe those were the grants that were made this year

24     that I will earn; I mean, if we meet all of our

25     performance targets when they vest three years from now.pgNbr=45
46

1     But, again, that's the piece of my future compensation

2     that's at risk depending upon the performance of Reynolds

3     American.

4          Q.  And what are those called?  What do you call

5     them within the company, you know, the incentive plan or

6     bonus, or whatever it's called, this restricted stock

7     award?

8          A.  We call it our long-term incentive plan.

9          Q.  Okay.  And did you receive money in 2009 that

10     matured, if you will, under the long-term incentive

11     plan?

12          A.  Yes.  That's included in the nonequity

13     incentive plan compensation, I think.

14          Q.  Okay.  So, in other words, the nonequity

15     incentive plan compensation includes long-term

16     incentives that matured in 2009.  But on this report, at

17     least, you also include those that won't mature until

18     three years from now, assuming that you all meet your

19     targets?

20          A.  Yes, that's the requirement of the Securities

21     and Exchange Commission.  These are the amounts that

22     we publish in the proxy, and they put -- their view is

23     that companies and investors need to understand the

24     comprehensive view of the compensation packages and

25     whether they be cash or, you know, future availability.pgNbr=46
47

1          Q.  If we look at your salary correctly, it's

2     $533,882?

3          A.  Yes.

4          Q.  If we take that and the nonequity incentive

5     plan compensation, do those together come up to the

6     $1.4 million that was on your W-2?

7          A.  Roughly, yes.  Well, that and this other

8     compensation, that 126, some portion of that.

9          Q.  Do you know what that is?

10          A.  Some of it is a payment that I get from the

11     company to replace benefits that they took away.  When I

12     joined the company, we had benefits for  we were given

13     a company car and those kinds of things.  And we did away

14     with those things in the early 2000s.  So now they are

15     paying me  I think the number is -- $46,000 to make up

16     for that.  So that's included in there.

17              The 401(k) match is included in there, those

18     kinds of things.  I mean, it's all described in our proxy

19     statement 

20          Q.  Okay.

21          A.   which I am --

22          Q.  Including the benefits?

23          A.  Yes.  And let me just kind of refer you to the

24     page.  All of this is on page 52 of our proxy statement,

25     Mr. Schultz.pgNbr=47
1          Q.  Okay.

2          A.  So I think what's happened here is that Forbes

3     has just lifted those amounts and put them on here.  I

4     mean, these are all disclosures that are required for

5     public companies.

6          Q.  Did the $46,000 that you received  you

7     mentioned a company car.  Does that also replace any

8     intangible benefits that were taken away, like pension

9     benefits, or retirement funds, or anything like that?

10          A.  No, it doesn't.  Let me  with respect to the

11     126  I mentioned the payments on the car.  This is the

12     former executive perquisites program.  And the forty-six

13     3,000 is described in note 9.  There are also qualified

14     matches and nonqualified plan credits for the 401(k).

15     Those amounts are $7,350 and $70,973.

16              So I think those amounts all added together --

17     it's all disclosed in the proxy -- come up to the 126.

18          Q.  And I think in the Smith case, or the Smith

19     Lincoln case, you testified that in 2008 your total

20     compensation was $2.2 million, but your total cash

21     compensation was $1.3 million.  Does that sound

22     accurate?

23          A.  That sounds accurate.

24          Q.  Do you remember your total cash compensation

25     for the year 2007?pgNbr=48
1          A.  No, but it would have been less than that,

2     because I was not the chief financial officer at the

3     time.  It would have been several hundred thousand

4     dollars less.

5          Q.  We can put that aside now.

6          A.  Okay.

7          Q.I believe you told me, Mr. Adams, that RAI has

8     never altered the amounts of dividends to shareholders

9     due to a punitive damage verdict, to your knowledge.  I

10     would like to ask you that question about R.J. Reynolds

11     Tobacco Company.  And let me pose the question directly.

12              To your knowledge, has R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

13     Company ever altered the amount of dividends paid to

14     a shareholder or shares as a result of any one or any

15     collection of punitive damage awards in smoking and

16     health litigation?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.

18          A.  First of all, there's only one shareholder, and

19     that's RAI.  And the dividends that it pays from time to

20     time -- I mean, there's not an established amounts of

21     dividends for Reynolds Tobacco in the same manner that

22     there is for Reynolds American.  Reynolds American pays

23     four quarterly dividends.  Currently, it's 90 cents a

24     quarter, but Reynolds Tobacco doesn't have a regimen

25     such as that because it's not a public company and so pgNbr=49
50

1              You know, you can look at Mr. Johnson's

2     presentation.  You can see that the dividends that

3     Reynolds Tobacco has paid over the years have varied.  In

4     fact, in one year there were no dividends paid at all.

5     So it just depends upon the need by Reynolds American for

6     cash and the manner in which that cash is moved to the

7     parent company, whether it's through dividends or by a

8     loan.  And that would be true for both Reynolds  excuse

9     me, for Reynolds as well as American Snuff and Conwood.

10     We don't  they are larger, but we don't really treat

11     them that differently.

12          Q.  Okay.  And let me ask you:  Whatever the

13     reason may be, let me ask you whether, to your

14     knowledge, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has ever paid

15     less of a dividend that it otherwise would have paid

16     to RAI as a result of a punitive damage award from a

17     smoking and health lawsuit?

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

19          A.  I'm not aware that they altered it because of

20     an award, and for the most part --

21          Q.  How about if we go back 

22              MS. HENNINGER:  I think he's still answering.

23          A.  Yeah.

24               (Continuing)  for an award.

25          Q.  How about if we go back before the days ofpgNbr=50
51

1     RAI; are you aware of any point in time in which R.J.

2     Reynolds Tobacco Company altered or reduced the amount

3     of the dividends that it otherwise would have paid as

4     a result of a punitive damages verdict or verdicts in

5     any smoking and health lawsuit or lawsuits?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  Again, I'm not aware that we have altered the

8     dividend policy based on awards or verdicts.

9          Q.  Will you be offering any opinions, Mr. Adams,

10     on RAI's or RJRT's goodwill or impairment of goodwill?

11              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

12          A.  I mean, if asked to do so, I will.  Actually,

13     I think most of the goodwill resides with the operating

14     company.

15          Q.  Okay.  And if you're asked to do so, what

16     would you say?

17          A.  I will generally describe what goodwill is.

18     That while it sits on our balance sheet, or there are

19     amounts that are recorded in the consolidated statements

20     for Reynolds American, you can't really  individually,

21     you can't monetize those values.  I mean, in contrast to

22     values for property, plant and equipment, receivables,

23     trademarks, fixed assets, all of these things can be

24     monetized discretely for value.

25              Goodwill is not one of those things that youpgNbr=51
52

1     can discretely sell.  That actually follows the business

2     itself, the enterprise value of the business.

3          Q.  And do you have any opinions about whether 

4     to what extent RJRT's goodwill has been impaired as a

5     result of any prior smoking and health lawsuits?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  To my knowledge, it hasn't been impaired as

8     a result of any smoking and health-related judgments

9     or verdicts.  It was impaired in 2003.  I mean, this

10     goodwill goes back, Mr. Schultz, to 1989 to the leverage

11     buyout.  And we measure it annually.  To my recollection,

12     the only time that it's been impaired was in 2003, and

13     that was not related.

14          Q.  And to what was that attributed?

15          A.  A downturn in the business.

16          Q.  Do you plan to offer any opinions on any

17     discreet-specific cash management policies?

18          A.  I think I said that I don't know that we have

19     discreet cash management policies at Reynolds American.

20     I mean, other than where we can invest the money that

21     we receive, I don't know that we have a policy that

22     mandates or describes how cash is moved from entity to

23     entity.

24          Q.  How about lines of credit?  Do you anticipate

25     testifying on direct to any lines of credit, or how theypgNbr=52
53

1     may be impacted by a verdict?

2          A.  Yeah, I might do that.  I mean, at Reynolds

3     American we do have a line of credit.  And so, you know,

4     an adverse verdict could impact that.  I might talk about

5     that if asked to do so.

6          Q.  Okay.  All right.

7              Describe that for me, if you would.  And we're

8     talking about Reynolds American, correct?

9          A.  Yeah.  I mean, none of our operating companies

10     have any lines of credit, all the borrowings are done at

11     Reynolds American.

12          Q.  Okay.  And you said that you might talk about

13     that.  Tell me, generally, what you would have to say on

14     the subject.

15          A.  Well, generally, we have a $500,000,000 line

16     of credit that's described in our 10-K with a number

17     of banks.  And, naturally, if there are verdicts or

18     adverse judgments against the company, lenders'

19     willingness to loan money is influenced by those kinds

20     of things and not in a positive fashion.

21          Q.  Do you intend to offer any opinions or

22     testimony on the possibility or the probability of

23     bankruptcy for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as a result

24     of a punitive damages verdict?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.pgNbr=53
54

1          A.  You know, I can talk about that if asked to do

2     so.  I doubt that that would come up.  But, you know, I

3     could talk about it.  Yes.

4          Q.  Well, let me ask you this:  There's a jury

5     instruction in Florida that says that a jury may not

6     amount an award of punitive damages that would

7     financially destroy the defendant.  What amount of

8     punitive damages would it take to financially destroy

9     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

10          A.  Well, the original Engle verdict would have

11     been substantial enough to do that, because the award

12     against Reynolds Tobacco was larger than the aggregate

13     amount of income that it earned since its inception in

14     1875.  So that's a pretty big number.

15          Q.  Okay.  That number was thrown out.  Tell me,

16     as we sit here today, what the lowest threshold number

17     is in your estimation.

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

19          A.  I'm not sure that there's a lowest threshold

20     information, because there's a lot of stuff that gets

21     interconnected.  One of those things is our ability to

22     borrow money should we need to do so.  And a large

23     judgment or a series of small judgments may invoke, or

24     may deter our banks from loaning us money.  I mean, if

25     they decide that there's a reason not to do that.  And sopgNbr=54
55

1     the ability to have cash, the ability to conduct

2     business, some of our suppliers may not want to do

3     business with us if they don't think we will pay them.

4              So, I mean, there are lots of consequences.

5     Employees may leave.  I mean, there's just  you can go

6     out there and look at companies that have gone through

7     bankruptcy.  I mean, some of them emerged and some of

8     them basically go away.  It's pretty serious stuff.

9          Q.  Okay.  Is your response that it's too complex

10     to post a single number on?

11          A.  Yes, sir, it is, because there's so many

12     dominoes that fall when things go bad.

13          Q.  If the jury in the Walden case entered a

14     punitive damages verdict in the amount of $50 million

15     against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and R.J. Reynolds

16     Tobacco Company at some point within the next 12 months

17     was required to pay that $50 million punitive damages

18     award, would that financially destroy R.J. Reynolds

19     Tobacco Company?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  It might, depending upon what else happens.

22          Q.  All other things being equal, I'm not

23     concerned about what else happens.  This jury is going

24     to award damages for one person, and that's Mr. Walden.

25     And they will be told that by the Court.pgNbr=55
56

1              My question is:  This verdict standing alone,

2     would a $50 million punitive damages verdict financially

3     destroy R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

4          A.  You know, I can't give you an honest answer

5     on that, Mr. Schultz, because things never happen

6     individually alone.  There's always consequences of

7     actions.  I mean, nothing ever happens alone.  There's

8     always things that happen as a consequence of large

9     awards such as the one that you just described.

10          Q.  Okay.  If the board of directors voted

11     tomorrow to pay $50 million to settle the Walden case,

12     and you cut a check from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

13     for that purpose, would it financially destroy the

14     company?

15          A.  Well, again, I can't answer that because there

16     would probably be  I mean, if that circumstance were to

17     occur, there would probably be hundreds, maybe thousands,

18     of other cases that were filed.  You know, you think

19     about the asbestos litigation.  I mean, you think about

20     all this mass tort litigation.  When companies make

21     payments, lots of people come to the table.

22          Q.  Is that why R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

23     refuses to settle cases?

24              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

25          A.  I don't know that we  I believe that wepgNbr=56
57

1     believe that we need to have our day in court and be

2     heard, and that's why we defend the cases the way that

3     we do.

4          Q.  You told me earlier now there have been  by

5     my count  something on the order of $150 million in

6     punitive damage verdicts against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

7     Company in the Engle Progeny cases that have been --

8     those are gross jury awards.  Does that sound right to

9     you, the right number, I mean?

10          A.  Against Reynolds Tobacco?

11          Q.  Correct.

12          A.  I was actually scanning that on the break, and

13     I don't have the ones subsequent to February.  So, I

14     mean, I don't have any reason to disagree with that, with

15     the number that you just threw out.

16          Q.  Okay.  Can you identify for me any lawsuit

17     that has been filed in the last six months that R.J.

18     Reynolds Tobacco Company attributes the filing to the

19     fact that punitive damage awards have been entered

20     against it in other cases?

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          A.  Not in the last six months, I haven't, but I

23     haven't actually undertaken the study to try and

24     determine that.

25          Q.  Right.pgNbr=57
58

1              Well, I guess what I'm trying to get to is

2     this:  If you're going to come to tell this jury, look,

3     if you all enter a big punitive damage award, you're

4     going to attract more lawyers and more lawsuits.  I

5     would like to know the basis for that, other than the

6     speculation that it might happen.  I would like to know

7     if there's any empirical basis to make that prediction.

8              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

9          A.  Well, I mean, the Engle case itself started

10     with a rather large award, actually more than rather

11     large.  I mean, it was an astronomical award against the

12     company, and that promulgated eight to 9,000 cases that

13     were filed.  So, I mean, there's an example.  I mean, it

14     hasn't happened in the last, you know, six months, but

15     that's an example of what might happen.

16          Q.  Right.

17              But RJRT didn't pay the Engle award, did it?

18          A.  No, sir.  We were not capable of paying that,

19     nor did the courts find that we were liable for it.

20          Q.  Are you a lawyer?

21          A.  No, sir, I'm not.

22          Q.  So it's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's

23     position that it was the size of the Engle verdict that

24     brought about the eight or 9,000 lawsuits that are now

25     pending against it?pgNbr=58
1              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

2          A.  I don't know that that's Reynolds' position.

3     I think -- I mean, if there had been no award on the

4     Engle class, and that it had been  it had gone in the

5     company's favor, then there wouldn't be eight or 9,000

6     individual cases that have been filed.  That was my

7     point.

8          Q.  Okay.  Can you give me any other example of

9     where payment of an award, or the mere fact of an award

10     against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, has resulted in

11     the filing of additional lawsuits against R.J. Reynolds

12     Tobacco Company, a discreet example?

13          A.  No, I don't have one of those.  Well, I mean,

14     there was the Broins case and that -- but I'm not sure

15     that that was actually a  well, actually, there was a

16     settlement in that.  But it wasn't to -- I think there

17     were moneys paid to the plaintiff's attorney and to set

18     up a foundation.  And then much like lots of different

19     circumstances here, but much like the circumstances that

20     we find ourselves with Engle and the flight attendants

21     could bring cases against the industry.  So there's that

22          Q.  How many judgments in the flight attendant

23     cases has R.J. Reynolds paid, to your knowledge?

24          A.  I don't know that sitting here right now.  I'm

25     not sure of any, but I don't know that.pgNbr=59
60

1              MS. HENNINGER:  It's in the 10-K.

2          Q.  Has R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or RAI taken

3     any efforts to alert the stockholders that there's any

4     potential for financial insolvency as a result of the

5     Engle Progeny cases pending against it?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  Only from the standpoint that we have -- you

8     know, we comprehensively disclosed all of these, the

9     cases, the case size, the trial activity, the fact that

10     there is increased trial activity in 2009 and more of

11     an increase in 2010 thus far this year and is expected.

12              I mean, there are all of these disclosures.  We

13     talk about all of this stuff.  So from that standpoint 

14     and I don't know that I would use the word "insolvency,"

15     but they can actually see that there are, you know, more

16     and more challenges that the company is facing with

17     respect to smoking and health litigation.

18              So from that regard and the fact that we talk

19     about caseloads, and the number of trials that we are in

20     when we communicate with investors and analysts.  So, I

21       mean, we've alerted to them the -- those risks to the 2 2              company.

23          Q.  And I guess my question is:  What are the

24     risks to the company that you have alerted them to as

25     the risk of financial insolvency as a result of thepgNbr=60
61

1     Engle Progeny cases?

2              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

3          A.  Well, I think if you  I think -- I mean, that

4     risk exists now, you know.  I don't know.  I wouldn't

5     want to sit here and handicap it today.  But if I did,

6     I would kind of give it low odds depending upon where we

7     sit today.  But things can change.  But I do think that

8     if you  I mean, one of the things that investors look

9     at when they  I mean, one of the ways to look at a

10     company -- and, actually, Mr. Johnson did this -- is

11     looking at the market capitalization, which is the result

12     of our stock price times a  excuse me, our stock price

13     is a result, or is the result of an estimate of earnings

14     times a  you know, times a rate, you know, a

15     capitalization rate.

16              And our capitalization rate in tobacco is

17     generally lower than other commercial activities, and one

18     of those reasons is always the litigation overhang that

19      or that's described.  So, again, it's --

20          Q.  Since the Engle  I'm sorry.

21          A.  I was going to say:  So, you know, the

22     capitalization rates for cigarette companies is generally

23     lower than commercial companies.  And so do the investors

24     understand the fact that litigation could way heavily on

25     the company?  Yeah, they do.  I mean, it's implied in thepgNbr=61
62

1     capitalization rates.

2          Q.  Right.

3              I want to talk about explicit statements.  And

4     my question to you is:  Whether R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

5     Company or RAI has explicitly stated in any fashion

6     since the inception of the Engle Progeny cases that the

7     existence of these cases pose a threat of financial

8     insolvency to the company?

9          A.  I don't think that we used the words "financial

10     insolvency."  I believe if you look in our litigation

11     footnotes, we talk about material impacts to the business

12     that adverse judgments could have, and payments could

13     have a material adverse impact on the business.  We do

14     make those statements.  And, actually, do I believe 

15          Q.  That is not synonymous material?  Adverse

16     impact is not synonymous with bankruptcy, is it?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  Could be.  No, it is not synonymous in of

19       itself, but a bankruptcy would be a material adverse 2 0              impact.

21          Q.  Right.

22              Material adverse impact includes a whole lot

23     of things, up to and including bankruptcy or financial

24     insolvency, right?

25          A.  That's a way to say it.  Yes.pgNbr=62

1          Q.  Do you plan to testify of RJR's net worth?

2          A.  I can if asked to do so.

3          Q.  Do you know RJR's net worth, as we sit here

4     today?

5          A.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

6          Q.  Okay.  And Reynolds Tobacco, if it paid a

7     billion in dividends to RAI today, all other things

8     being equal, tomorrow its net worth would be **REDACTED

9     CONFIDENTIAL**, correct?

10          A.  It would be.

11              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

12          A.  It would be a billion dollars lower, correct 

13          Q.  Right.

14          A.   all things being equal.

15          Q.  Are the companies  yes.

16              Are there companies, Mr. Adams, that operate

17     with a negative net worth?

18          A.  Yes, there are.

19          Q.  Have you seen companies who operate with a

20     zero net worth?

21          A.  Well, not for long, I guess.  I actually don't

22     have a recollection of entities that do that without some

23     kind of arrangement, like whether they are under

24     bankruptcy protection.  All of that stuff gets wiped out.

25     All your equities are gone.  You basically devaluepgNbr=63
1     everything.  I suspect that there may be companies that

2     operate at a deficit,  small.  It could be small

3     companies, companies that are start-ups that have a fair

4     amount of promised capital or venture capital involved.

5              I suspect that there are some, but I actually

6     don't know many large commercial companies that operate

7     at a deficit net worth.

8          Q.  Have you reviewed Philip Morris' 2009

9     financials?

10          A.  No, I actually haven't seen Philip Morris'.

11          Q.  Okay.  How about Altria's?

12          A.  Yeah, I actually have looked at those.

13          Q.  Okay.  Are you aware of the dividend policies

14     that I described earlier between Philip Morris USA and

15     Altria by virtue of having read those reports?

16              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Objection to form.

17          A.  I know that Philip Morris USA dividends money

18     up, but I don't know what Philip Morris USA's net worth

19     is.  So I can't really answer that.  I do know or that I

20     believe that Altria is a company.  And that they receive

21     money for their public debt and for payments of their

22     dividends to their shareholders by getting money from

23     their operating companies -- Philip Morris USA, U.S.

24     Tobacco, John Middleton, St. Michelle One  much in the

25     same fashion that Reynolds gets money.  I mean, they havepgNbr=64
65

1     a need for cash at the corporate holding company level.

2              So I would suspect that they move it up through

3     dividends or loans in the same 

4          Q.  Are you aware  you can finish your answer.

5          A.  I think I have.  Go ahead.

6          Q.  Are you aware that Philip Morris USA  as we

7     sit here today  claims a net worth that is far less

8     than RJR's claimed net worth?

9          A.  Well, that wouldn't surprise me.  I mean, part

10     of our 

11              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Objection to the form.

12              Go ahead.

13          A.  Part of R.J. Reynolds' net worth includes about

14     $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** worth of goodwill.  It's

15     carried over from the 1989 transaction.  And I'm not

16     sure, because Philip Morris has never been through a

17     transaction like that, a leveraged buyout.  I mean, they

18     would only have goodwill that relates to the UST

19     transaction, perhaps the Middelton transaction and maybe

20     a little bit when they purchased some brands through

21     Liggett back in 1999, but not anything that's really

22     attached to the cigarette business, per se, except the

23     Liggett brands.

24          Q.  Do you believe  based on your expertise 

25     that current net worth is the best indicator of thepgNbr=65
66

1     company's ability to pay a punitive damages award?

2              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

3              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Join.

4          A.  I think it's one of the  I think it may be

5     one of the things to look at.  I don't think there is

6     any one single thing that I, personally, would use in

7     evaluating ability to pay.  I mean, one of the things

8     that would be, you know, cash.  That's also significant

9     to determine.

10          Q.  What else do you think would be either

11     independently a measure of ability to pay, or something

12     that would go into the mix?

13          A.  Liabilities; you know, what types of

14     liabilities a company has.  So, you know, looking at

15     Reynolds Tobacco, I mean, they have $ **REDACTED

16     CONFIDENTIAL** in  and I don't think this has been put

17     on the record before.  But balance sheets are snapshots

18     of a company's financial position at a point in time, and

19     for purposes of this discussion we are talking about

20     December 31st.

21              So, for instance, Reynolds Tobacco -- as

22     Mr. Johnson pointed out  has $ **REDACTED

23     CONFIDENTIAL** of cash after December 31st.  Okay.  And

24     then there are current assets in here, which are

25     generally convertible to cash within the business cycle,pgNbr=66
67

1     which is about a year.  That's what generally  that's

2     the general guideline that you use to determine current

3     assets versus long-term assets.  And that same measure is

4     what you use to determine liabilities that need to be

5     extinguished in a year.

6              So anything that's in current liabilities is

7     generally viewed as having to be turned into cash within

8     a year, or that you have to satisfy those obligations.

9     Where I was going with this is:  That's one of the things

10     that I think you need to look at, is the liabilities that

11     a company has.  And, as I said, Reynolds Tobacco has $

12     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of accounts payable that need

13     to be satisfied for them to continue dealing with their

14     existing vendors.

15              Similarly, there are tobacco settlement

16     accruals, and these are accruals for payments under the

17     Master Settlement Agreement and the four separately

18     settling states.  And those amounts are $ **REDACTED

19     CONFIDENTIAL** .  The vast majority of those things for

20     the MSA, as you may know, are paid in April, on

21     April 15th of -- in this case, in 2010.  So all of those

22     moneys, all of this cash that was sitting on the balance

23     sheet is used to make those payments to the MSA.  The

24     four separately settling states get paid at different

25     times during the year, but they also are paid within thepgNbr=67
68

1     calendar year.

2              So there are those kinds of things that need to

3     be considered.

4          Q.  Has R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company found itself

5     unable to make the MSA payments at any point since they

6     were instituted?

7          A.  No, we have not.  That's because we collected

8     all of that cash during the year, and we hold it, invest

9     it in treasury securities, which are safe, and then we

10     remit it on April 15th of the following year.

11          Q.  And I'm going to walk through the financials

12     with you.  Maybe you can give me an idea of where the

13     company is at today as opposed to December 31st on some

14     of those figures.  But the company anticipates being in

15     the same, or certainly working towards being in the

16     same, or even better position on December 31st of this

17     year than it was on December 31st of last year, correct?

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

19          A.  It actually may be a little lower, Mr. Schultz,

20     because we continue to see volume declines in the

21     business.  And those volume declines right now -- I think

22     everybody is accumulating about 70 cents a pack for the

23     cigarettes.  And I think they will be, you know  I

24     mean, estimates right now are that the volume declines

25     this year, the analyst assessments that volume declinespgNbr=68
69

1     are around four percent.

2              So there actually may be less cigarettes sold

3     and less money accumulated.  And, therefore, also -- I

4     mean, to be fair, less money to pay out, although while

5     there is less money to pay out; the MSA payments escalate

6     annually by the higher of the consumer price index, which

7     has actually been less than one percent or three percent.

8              So our payments are going up three percent a

9     year kind of locked into perpetuity.

10          Q.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company takes the

11     position, doesn't it, that it's a good thing for people

12     to migrate from cigarettes to noncombustible tobacco

13     products or to no tobacco at all, correct?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  Yeah.  That's part of the CSR that I was

16     talking about.  We think that if people are concerned

17     about their health, that they should quit smoking.

18     But if they want to choose to continue using tobacco

19     products, we believe noncombustible products are less

20     harmful.

21              That's correct.

22          Q.  And so even though it results in less income

23     for the company, the company takes the position that

24     that's a good thing, correct; that smoking numbers are

25     declining?pgNbr=69
70

1          A.  We think it's better for people to -- if they

2     are concerned about their health, that they choose

3     something other than cigarettes, a tobacco product other

4     than cigarettes to consume, if they choose to stay using

5     tobacco products.

6          Q.  Does R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company break down

7     its financial statements on a state-by-state basis?

8              Is there any set of records within the company

9     that lays out income  all of the financial information

10     that you see on a balance sheet -- on a state-by-state

11     basis?

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

13          A.  No, there is not.  I mean, there are certain

14     records that are kept state by state such as volume,

15     those kinds of things, but not financial records, per se.

16          Q.  Can you tell me, or can anyone at RJRT tell

17     me, what percentage of RJRT's sales of tobacco products

18     is attributable to the State of Florida?

19          A.  I can tell you that I believe it to be about

20     five percent since that represents about five percent

21     of the cigarette industry volume.

22          Q.  Does it represent about five percent of the

23     U.S. population?  Do you know?

24          A.  I think it does, actually.

25          Q.  Do you know what RJRT's market share is in thepgNbr=70
71

1     State of Florida?

2          A.  I don't know that specifically, Mr. Schultz.

3     Those things change over time as well.  I mean, I can

4     probably get that information.  I would suspect it would

5     be  you know, prior to the federal excise tax and

6     Florida's increased excise taxes, I would have guessed it

7     would largely be -- it would be in the 27, 28 percent

8     range, which is what R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's

9     market share is across the country.  But since the excise

10     taxes  I mean, I don't have anything more recent that

11     I've looked at.

12              I mean, I know that volumes in Florida declined

13     significantly with the federal excise tax increase.  And

14     I believe they also increased their state excise tax by

15     about a dollar a pack.  I would have to check that.  And

16     I know there was a lot of down-trading from our brands to

17     what's known as fourth-tier brands at that time.  So we

18     could have seen a market share decline.

19          Q.  Are you familiar with what impact increased

20     excise taxes on cigarettes have on youth initiation of

21     smoking, generally?

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

23          A.  I believe that excise taxes on youth smoking

24     probably has the same effect that it does on the general

25     population.  And that is that as excise taxes go up pgNbr=71
72

1     and there are excise taxes that are included in the price

2     in a pack of cigarettes  that the incidence of smoking

3     goes down.  But I don't know that as a fact for youth.

4          Q.  And is it your understanding that there's 

5     that, proportionally speaking, the impact is the same

6     on children as it's on adults?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

8          A.  I actually haven't seen 

9              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

10          A.  I'm sorry.  I kind got tied up in the mic here.

11              I actually haven't seen any data.  I don't know

12     that we have that kind of data.  I mean, generally, the

13     public health folks indicate that the incidence of youth

14     tobacco usage is going down.  I think I actually read

15     that in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, and

16     some of that, I believe, is related to the efforts by

17     Reynolds and others and youth tobacco prevention and,

18     certainly, some of it is due to the increasing cost of

19     a pack of cigarettes.

20              I mean, cigarettes last year went up 25

21     percent.  The price of a pack of cigarettes nationally

22     went up 25 percent as a result of the federal excise tax.

23     And it probably increased higher than that in

24     jurisdictions that also had increased state excise taxes.

25          Q.  Is part of R.J. Reynolds' corporate supportpgNbr=72
73

1     responsibility platform with respect to youth smoking,

2     is part of support for higher excise taxes is in order

3     to diminish youth initiation?

4          A.  No.  I mean, in general, we would  you know,

5     we opposed federal  we opposed excise taxes because

6     we are 

7          Q.  Because you are 

8          A.  We opposed them because it tends to reduce 

9     because it disproportionately impacts smokers who

10     shoulder the burden for revenues that are trying to

11     be raised in the state.  And most smokers  you know,

12     the demographics on that  make 35 to $45,000 a year.

13     And we think it's a regressive form of taxation.

14          Q.  Right.

15              It's also regressive against kids under the

16     age of 18, isn't it?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  I can't say, you know, why children spend money

19     on tobacco.  All I know is that we would we -- you know,

20     we use our best efforts to convince them not to do so.

21          Q.  Right.

22              But you would agree with me  based on what

23     we just talked about  if excise taxes go down, that

24     you can anticipate youth smoking rates would go up,

25     correct?pgNbr=73
74

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

2          A.  I don't know that sitting here right now.

3          Q.  Okay.  So you agree with me that raising

4     excise taxes helps drive down youth smoking numbers, but

5     you don't agree that lowering excise taxes would help

6     drive up youth smoking numbers?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

8          A.  Actually, I think what I said was that the

9     general population, when excise taxes go up, volumes go

10     down.  And I said, you know, there may be an expectation,

11     or there may be a similar dynamic that occurs for youth

12     smoking.  I don't know.  I haven't seen data in that

13     regard.  All I do know is that  and I think I said

14     this earlier, too  the incidence of youth smoking has

15     declined over the years as reported by the public health

16     authorities.

17              And I think some of that is, in large part,

18     due to our efforts to educate  you know, to youth

19     nonsmoking efforts.  Some of it could be the excise

20     taxes.  I just don't know about that, because I just

21     haven't seen any data.

22          Q.  The efforts that you described by Reynolds to

23     help drive down the members of youth smokers, when did

24     those efforts formally begin?

25          A.  You know, the "Right Decisions Right NowpgNbr=74
75

1     Program" has been around for more than ten years.  I'm

2     going to just look in here.  I kind of thought there was

3     a date that was  well, I was wrong about that.  The

4     "Right Decisions Right Now Program" was launched in 1991

5     and is continually been refined.  And we have a long

6     history of use in the United States and Puerto Rico.

7              So since the earlier nineties, that's well

8     before there was any  you know, before we had our

9     Corporate Social Responsibility Report before the MSA we

10     were trying to educate youth not to use tobacco.  So it

11     goes back, well, almost 20 years really, for decades.

12          Q.  Does R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company also

13     attribute the diminution in youth initiation rates, at

14     least in part, to the restrictions that it has complied

15     with under the MSA?

16          A.  I'm sure there's lots of reasons, Mr. Schultz.

17     I'm sure that's a part of it.  Again, I haven't looked at

18     any particular data to parse that out.  I don't even know

19     if we have that type of data.  It may all be held by the

20     public health authorities, but I would suspect it would

21     be like many things, a number of factors.  But,

22     certainly, you know, we believe that what we are doing

23     for youth, the "Right Decisions Right Now Program" and

24     other programs that we do, have discouraged youth from

25     using tobacco.pgNbr=75
76

1          Q.  Do you know how much money RJRT spent on

2     advertising in Florida in the last year?

3          A.  No, I do not.

4              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection to the last

5     question.  Go ahead.

6          A.  I know, in total, what we spent by Reynolds

7     Tobacco, but I don't know anything that's Florida

8     specific.

9               (Exhibit 3 was marked for identification).

10          Q.  Okay.  And we will get to the totals, I think,

11     when we look at Mr. Johnson's slides.

12              I want to take a look at Exhibit 3, this March

13     2010, letter by Susan Ivey.

14          A.  I got it.

15              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, there's Exhibit 3.

16     There are two letters that are within 3.  Did you want

17     to break them out, or is 3 going to be both letters?

18              MR. SCHULTZ:  Actually, I don't intend to ask

19     any questions about the second letter.  We can take that

20     altogether, if you would like.

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.

22          A.  That's the one that's dated March 2009?

23          Q.  That's right.

24          A.  Okay.

25          Q.  The first sentence in the 2010 letter, ExhibitpgNbr=76
77

1     3, says:  "Reynolds American, Inc. and its operating

2     companies delivered strong underlying performance in

3     2009 despite an especially challenging economic and

4     industry environment."

5              My question to you is:  Whether the economic

6     challenges and industry environment, as those terms are

7     used in this sentence, does that refer to smoking and

8     health litigation, or is that referring to market

9     conditions or other forces?

10              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

11          A.  I believe it's meant to refer to other market

12     conditions such as the federal excise tax, and the FDA

13     legislation that was passed in June of last year, and

14     just general competitive activity in the marketplace.

15          Q.  Okay.  And this also mentions negative impact

16     of a significant increase in pension expense.  Would the

17     significant increase in pension expense be related in

18     any way to smoking and health litigation?

19          A.  No, it was actually related to the market

20     downturn in late 2008 and early 2009.

21          Q.  And the first sentence of the second paragraph

22     states:  "Reported 2009 net income of $962 million was

23     down 28.1 percent driven by trademark impairment and

24     restructuring charges."

25              The sentence does continue, but I want to askpgNbr=77
78

1     you really what that means, "trademark impairment and

2     restructuring charges"?  What does that refer to?

3              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.

4          A.  Well, much like you asked me on goodwill,

5     Reynolds Tobacco has  and, actually, so does the

6     American Snuff Company.  But, primarily, Reynolds Tobacco

7     has various values ascribed to its brands.  And those

8     values are reviewed annually, unless there is some

9     triggering event.  I mean, they are reviewed annually to

10     determine whether they are still a good estimate of the

11     value of those brands.

12              And that's looking out into the future to

13     determine, you know, how much  you know, what the sales

14     are going to be and those kinds of things.  And with the

15     federal excise tax that was enacted on April the 1st of

16     2009, those trademarks were deemed to be less valuable

17     by several hundred million dollars.

18              So we reduced the value of those brands by

19     several hundred million dollars, which basically says

20     that we expect to sell a lot less cigarettes in the

21     future as a result of the increased price.

22          Q.  Okay.  And so the trademark impairment was

23     driven primarily by federal excise taxes?  It was not

24     driven in any way by verdicts in smoking and health

25     litigation, correct?pgNbr=78
1          A.  That would be correct.

2          Q.  How about the restructuring charges; what does

3     that refer to?

4          A.  At the end of 2008, because we saw -- with the

5     federal excise tax, we saw that we were going to be

6     manufacturing fewer cigarettes going forward.  So we

7     asked for people in the plant, in our manufacturing

8     facility at Reynolds Tobacco, for volunteers to have

9     their jobs eliminated.  And our benefit programs were

10     changing beginning January the 1st of 2010.

11              So we gave people an opportunity to volunteer

12     in advance of that to basically preserve -- frankly, a

13     better severance package.  And we had some 400 people

14     volunteer to do that, and those are the only ones that

15     we accepted.

16              So this was a voluntary separation program that

17     we had 400 employees from Reynolds Tobacco sign up for.

18     And they will be leaving the company over 2010, again

19     because the volumes going forward as a result of the

20     federal excise tax increase and other market forces,

21     we are much lower than we had viewed them years ago.

22          Q.  Did I understand you correctly  and if I

23     did, just give me kind of the 30,000-foot description of

24     what changes there were in the pension plan.  I think

25     you said there were forthcoming changes in the pensionpgNbr=79
1     plan?

2          A.  No.  No, the severance plan, the severance plan

3     which is 

4          Q.  All right.  I understand.

5          A.  Okay.

6          Q.  Thanks.  In this letter 

7          A.  Excuse me.

8          Q.  It has a number of 

9          A.  Mr. Schultz, nothing has changed in our pension

10     plan.  I just wanted to get that out there.  I mean, the

11     pension benefits and those kinds of things are unchanged

12     in 2010 versus 2009.  So nothing has changed the pension

13     plan.  It's just a severance plan in terms of your

14     ability to get that severance over time as opposed to

15     lump sums and, you know, earning vacation while you're

16     on severance.

17              Those are some  there were some changes to

18     make that plan a bit less lucrative in 2010 than there

19     were in 2009.  And we gave our longstanding -- we gave

20     all employees an opportunity to take advantage of that

21     change, basically, to leave with a bit of a better

22     package in 2009 versus announcing this and doing it in

23     2010.

24          Q.  Okay.  The expenses associated with the

25     pension plan increased during 2009; is that correct?pgNbr=80
1          A.  Yes, they did.

2          Q.  And those increased as a result of market

3     conditions, not as a result of smoking and health-

4     related litigation; is that right?

5          A.  That's right.  There was a  by 2008 most

6     pension plans, and ours included, had negative returns

7     generally in the neighborhood of about 30 percent, okay,

8     versus, you know, prior to that they were positive.  And

9     that large decline in the pension balances, our pensions

10     were fully -- we were fully funded at the end of 2007.

11              And then with all of the market disruptions

12     that occurred -- when I say "market disruptions," I'm

13     talking about the Stock Market and particularly towards,

14     I guess, the back half of 2008 there were significant

15     losses in the pension plan and, actually, I guess across

16     all over the country.  And so what we're doing now is

17     earning our way back out of there and putting some money

18     in because we have an obligation to those retirees.

19               (Exhibit 4 was marked for identification).

20              MR. SCHULTZ:  Let me ask you to take a look

21     at Exhibit 4, which is your  actually, if we can take

22     literally take three minutes for a break.  Would that be

23     all right with, everybody?

24              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Yes.pgNbr=81
82

1              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  I will be right back.

2               (Recess taken).

3     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

4          Q.  Mr. Adams, I marked as Exhibit 4 the Defendant

5     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's Supplemental Expert

6     Disclosure that was served on May 6th of 2010.  Do you

7     have a copy of that?

8          A.  I do.

9          Q.  I want to walk through that.  I understand,

10     you know, as with any witness, you couldn't know exactly

11     what questions you're going to be asked.  You have

12     testified in trial before, haven't you, though,

13     essentially in the same capacity in which you will be

14     testifying in the Walden case; is that right?

15          A.  Well, I don't know what capacity I will be

16     testifying in in the Walden case, but, yes, I have

17     testified at trial before.

18          Q.  Okay.  Well, the expert disclosure that we are

19     holding is supposed to indicate the capacity in which

20     you will be testifying at trial.

21          A.  Oh, I'm sorry; okay, primarily as a fact

22     witness.  Yes.  Okay.  I'm with you.

23          Q.  Right.

24              With some potential expert opinions, I

25     believe?pgNbr=82
83

1          A.  Yes.

2          Q.  So how many times, by the way, have you

3     testified in trial?

4          A.  Three or four; three, I believe.

5          Q.  Okay.  Are those all since your time with the

6     R.J. Reynolds family?

7          A.  Yes.

8          Q.I will ask you a little bit about that in a

9     few minutes.

10              First, I'm down at the last full paragraph on

11     the first page of Exhibit 4.  It says you may be asked

12     to testify regarding corporate finances, market

13     performance and business operations, including corporate

14     governance, executive management, stakeholders,

15     policies, laws and regulations relating to such

16     operation, positions on issues related to smoking and

17     health and other ongoing activities included in the

18     corporate social responsibility program and community

19     involvement of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

20              That's a mouthful.  What I would like to do,

21     if I can, is just get your best sort of 10,000-foot

22     description of what it is that you believe you will be

23     talking about when you take the stand, assuming we reach

24     the punitive damages phase in the Walden case.

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.pgNbr=83
84

1          A.  Well, clearly, any  I mean, if we get to the

2     punitive damages stage, I'm going to be asked about

3     corporate finances.  I mean, I think just the words

4     actually pretty adequately describe much of this.

5     Corporate finances of Reynolds Tobacco and its entire

6     relationships with Reynolds American, the market

7     performance and business operations is probably just

8     talking about the trends of our market share and the

9     underlying business.

10              When I say "our," that's Reynolds Tobacco's

11     market performance and its business operations.  I can

12     talk about the executive management, who the stakeholders

13     are.  The stakeholders for Reynolds Tobacco are different

14     from the stakeholders at Reynolds American, and I may

15     draw those distinctions.  Some of that I've already

16     discussed with you, Mr. Schultz.

17              The laws and regulations relating to such

18     operations would be things such as, you know, we are now

19      that Reynolds Tobacco is now under the regulations of

20     the Food and Drug Administration.  There are various laws

21     and regulations that relate to the company, some of those

22     are promulgated by the U.S. Government, some of those by

23     the states, and some of those by agreements such as the

24     Master Settlement Agreement.  There are things that we

25     do, that Reynolds Tobacco does, that are a result of thepgNbr=84
85

1     voluntary signing of that agreement.

2              And then with respect to other positions on

3     smoking and health, those would be the things that I

4     actually started to talk about today in our Corporate

5     Social Responsibility Report.  And other ongoing

6     activities would be the things  those four other

7     planks, sustainability and developing people or, you

8     know, employee responsibility, community engagement,

9     supplier responsibility and environmental sustainability

10              I can touch on each of those if asked to do so.

11          Q.  Let me ask you this:  The language out of your

12     disclosure referring to positions on issues related to

13     smoking and health, does that fold into the Corporate

14     Responsibilities Report, or are there other issues on

15     smoking and health outside of that report that you also

16     plan to testify on?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  I believe that I would confine my testimony

19     to the Corporate Social Responsibility Report, unless

20     somebody takes me outside of there.  I mean, in terms of

21     my preparation is going to be based on the things that

22     are in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which

23     has been or will be provided to you.

24              MS. HENNINGER:  I e-mailed it to you, Matt.

25              MR. SCHULTZ:  Thanks.pgNbr=85
1          Q.I guess there was a big caveat there, and that

2     was:  Unless you were asked questions that take you

3     outside of it.  If I understand you correctly, your

4     anticipation, as you sit here today, based on

5     preparations today and, of course, two weeks away from

6     trial at this point, is that you would confine smoking

7     and health positions to what's contained in

8     the Corporate Responsibility Report, correct?

9              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

10          A.  Well, that would be my intention.  But if you

11     ask me something that's outside of that, I'm going to

12     have to be responsive or try to respond to that.

13          Q.  Sure.  I understand that.

14              It says you also may be asked to provide

15     testimony including expert opinion testimony regarding

16     evidence by our expert, Mr. Johnson.

17              Have you read his deposition?

18          A.  Yes, I did, all 265 pages.

19          Q.  It would have been shorter if I was in

20     control; believe me, but I was not.

21              MS. HENNINGER:  I don't want any comments on

22     that.

23          Q.  Let me ask you a couple of quick questions on

24     your CV.  Did you grow up in North Carolina?

25          A.  No, I did not.  I grew up in Pennsylvania.pgNbr=86
1     Well, I attended -- I was born and attended high school

2     in Central Pennsylvania.  And, by the way, this CV is 

3     actually, my assistant provided this.  And this is

4     actually a much more blown-out version of my CV than the

5     one that I would customarily present, not that there's

6     anything wrong or to hide in there.

7              It's just not the one that I would -- this is

8     more of a personal CV as opposed to one that I would use

9     professionally.

10          Q.  An A.B. in accounting from Duke University in

11     1972.  Is that a four-year degree?

12          A.  It is, yes.

13          Q.  And did you go then from graduation to the

14     Liggett Group?

15          A.  I did.

16          Q.  Did you have any background in tobacco or

17     tobacco-related fields, or was that your first exposure

18     to any companies involved in any way in tobacco?

19          A.  I actually picked some tobacco one time up

20     in Pennsylvania as a summer job.  They grow, actually,

21     cigar tobacco up there.  I grew up kind of in the Amish

22     area.  So I actually did pick some tobacco, but other

23     than that, no.  I mean, I have no exposure.  I just

24     wanted  you know, I just took a job with Liggett.

25          Q.  Where was that?pgNbr=87
1          A.  In Durham, North Carolina.

2          Q.  And then you went to Deloitte & Touche?

3          A.  Yes, in 1976.

4          Q.  Did you manage tobacco-related accounts from

5     the inception at Deloitte & Touche?  I understand that

6     you did later.

7          A.  Not initially.  I mean, actually, in the

8     eighties I did some work for Liggett.  And then I also

9     managed -- there was a leaf tobacco dealer called

10     Standard Commercial Tobacco that was headquartered in

11     North Carolina, and I worked with them.  Today, I think

12     they are known as AllianceOne.

13              So I did have a bit of a background in

14     cigarettes from Liggett, and then later on leaf tobacco

15     as a result of my relationship with Standard Commercial.

16          Q.  And did you handle Reynolds  either Reynolds

17     Tobacco or Reynolds' affiliate accounts  when you were

18     at Deloitte & Touche as well?

19          A.  I did, beginning in 1990.

20          Q.  Now, I see you moved to Winston-Salem in 1990.

21     Did the move prompt the changes in the accounts of RJR,

22     or did the taking over of the accounts prompt the move?

23          A.  The taking over the accounts prompted the move.

24          Q.  You were involved, I guess, in the -- I don't

25     know if the right word is "merger."  Maybe you can tellpgNbr=88
1     me.  In 2004, can you describe that transaction for me,

2     generally, with Reynolds Tobacco and B&W?

3          A.  Sure.  It was a combination of companies.  A

4     merger, if you will, where Reynolds acquired the assets

5     and certain liabilities of the Brown and Williamson

6     Company and in exchange provided Brown & Williamson

7     Holdings with 42 percent of Reynolds American stock.

8              It's a lot more complicated than that, but

9     that's it in a nutshell.

10          Q.  Okay.  Did the liabilities include liabilities

11     of manufacturing cigarettes in the United States?

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Repeat that question.

13          A.  Can you ask me that question again?

14          Q.  Yeah.

15              You mentioned that RJRT or, I guess, RAI --

16     maybe you can clarify for me -- assumed the liabilities,

17     certain of the liabilities I think you said, from Brown

18     & Williamson.

19              My question is:  Those liabilities included,

20     didn't they, any legal liability related to the

21     manufacturing of cigarettes in the United States?

22          A.  Not the manufacturing, the sale actually of

23     cigarettes in the United States.  Reynolds Tobacco

24     assumed the liability, those liabilities, for that.

25          Q.  Including liabilities for smoking and health-pgNbr=89
90

1     related lawsuits?

2          A.  That's correct, Reynolds Tobacco assumed those

3     liabilities.

4          Q.  Right.  It assumed them voluntarily, correct?

5              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

6          A.  It assumed them as part of the merger

7     transaction.  That's correct.

8          Q.I suppose there was due diligence done to the

9     extent that Reynolds Tobacco understood that when it

10     took on Brown & Williamson's liabilities in that regard,

11     that there could be future smoking and health litigation

12     arising out of Brown & Williamson's prior conduct,

13     correct?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  There was due diligence that was done,

16     Mr. Schultz.  I don't know specifically if it was done on

17     a case-by-case basis, but we were generally familiar with

18     smoking and health litigation at Reynolds.  And to the

19     extent that Brown & Williamson was the same, or slightly

20     different than ours, I think we gained an understanding

21     of that.

22          Q.  And how is it that RAI became the sole

23     shareholder of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?  Can you

24     describe that for me?

25          A.  I think -- well, I mean, there were a seriespgNbr=90
91

1     of transactions that occurred, and Reynolds Tobacco

2     Holding, I think, had previously been the parent company

3     of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  And I think what

4     happened was that Reynolds American was created above the

5     holding company, and then the Reynolds Tobacco Holding

6     fell immediately below that when Reynolds American was

7     formed; it created more stock.  Okay.

8              And so there were  Reynolds American has

9     about 300 million shareholders, I think; had about

10     300 million shareholders outstanding at the time of the

11     merger.  And in return for the contribution of the assets

12     and the assumption of the liabilities by Reynolds

13     Tobacco, Reynolds American provided Brown & Williamson

14     Holdings with 42 percent of Reynolds American stock.

15              Now, I'm going slow here because I'm trying

16     to remember.  I had a chart on this at one point, but I

17     obviously don't have it in front of me right now.  And

18     I think at that point Reynolds American exchanged the

19     Reynolds Tobacco Holding shareholders' stock.  They had

20     stock in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holding.  I think they

21     exchanged it one for one, and that represents about

22     58 percent of the then-outstanding shareholders of

23     Reynolds American with the other 42 percent being through

24     Brown & Williamson Holdings.

25          Q.  Okay.  And going slow is a good thing.pgNbr=91
1              I take it from your description that R.J.

2     Reynolds Tobacco Company is the entity that assumed the

3     liability of Brown & Williamson for the sale of tobacco

4     products in the U.S., correct?

5          A.  That is correct.  Yes.

6          Q.  Did RAI -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

7          A.  No, I finished.

8          Q.  Did RAI also assume those liabilities, or did

9     only R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company assume those

10     liabilities?

11          A.  Only R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  I mean, if

12     you go back and look  and I testified about this once

13     before.  So I have some recollection about this.  The

14     wording is that  and, actually, what we published was

15     that RAI in certain circumstances or instances

16     indemnifies, but R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

17     indemnifies the smoking and health.  The circumstances

18     or instances in which Reynolds American would indemnify

19     Brown & Williamson Holdings related specifically to

20     material errors and omissions in publicly-filed

21     documents.

22              So anything that we would have said in the

23     Securities and Exchange, the formation agreements and

24     those kinds of things, about the formation of Reynolds

25     American and the publication of those financialpgNbr=92
93

1     statements, if there was anything wrong there, they would

2     have been the responsibility of -- those liabilities

3     would have been the responsibility of Reynolds American.

4              The smoking and health and those kinds of

5     things that were more operating company specific were the

6     responsibility of Reynolds Tobacco.  And that's in our

7     formation agreements, I believe.

8          Q.  Okay.  And does that remain the case today as

9     well in terms of -- I'm speaking specifically of RJRT

10     having the liability for Brown & Williamson on the

11     operating side.

12          A.  Yes, it is.

13          Q.  Okay.  Does RJRT carry its own liability for

14     smoking and health suits against it, or has RAI assumed

15     those liabilities?

16          A.  No.  I mean, Reynolds Tobacco  I mean, to the

17     extent that those things exist, it has those liabilities

18     on its books.  But, you know, I can tell you that -- I

19     mean, other than when a final judgment is issued and we

20     have exhausted all appeals, there were no accruals on the

21     books for smoking and health litigation because it

22     doesn't meet the requirements of FASB 5 as we previously

23     discussed.  It's not probable and it's not estimatable.

24          Q.  And so am I correct that a verdict in the

25     Walden case, which involves Brown & Williamson andpgNbr=93
94

1     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company  brand use by Brown &

2     Williamson of Brown & Williamson products, I should say

3      in no event would RAI actually write a check to

4     satisfy a judgment out of this case, correct?

5          A.  RAI would not.  I mean, RJRT may once things

6     are finally decided, but RAI would not.

7          Q.  And that may affect dividends that are paid

8     to RAI somewhere down the line, but RAI does not have

9     liability as such for the claims made in this lawsuit,

10     correct?

11          A.  It doesn't have liability, per se.  However, it

12     depends upon the operation and the cash flows of Reynolds

13     Tobacco, as well as its other subsidiaries to funds its

14     different continued payments, its debt payments, its

15     pension plan payments and the salaries that it pays to

16     the RAI employees as well as other corporate expenses.

17              So there is a dependency.

18          Q.  At the time that RAI became the sole

19     shareholder of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was

20     aware, wasn't it, that there were not only pending

21     lawsuits against RJRT, but that the future smoking and

22     health lawsuits, including the possibility of punitive

23     damages, were a future possibility, correct?

24          A.  Yeah, I believe that there was that

25     understanding.pgNbr=94
95

1          Q.  Now, you've mentioned the MSA.  And let me

2     throw in the Florida settlement agreement as well.  Do

3     you  based on your preparation today, as we sit here

4     today  plan on discussing the MSA requirements

5     including the financial obligations that are imposed

6     on Reynolds as a result of that?

7          A.  I would plan to do that, because I think that's

8     an integral part of the story.

9          Q.  Okay.  How does it integrate into the story?

10     Why is that something that you feel is important to let

11     the jury know?

12          A.  Well, I think the jury needs to have

13     perspective on how the MSA affects our financial

14     position.  And if it were not  I mean, Mr. Johnson

15     has  and we will probably get to that.  I mean, that

16     will likely be determined on you.  But, I mean, I'm sure

17     we will go through his exhibits.  But he points out the

18     amount of cash that we have on hand, which is factually

19     accurate.  But it doesn't -- he just omitted talking

20     about the liabilities that we have and that we have to

21     pay-  And I can almost guarantee you that if we didn't

22     have $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of liability, or $

23     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of payments to make in April of

24     2010, we wouldn't be carrying $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

25     of cash at the end of the year.pgNbr=95
1              I mean, just financially it's not an efficient

2     use of the balance sheet.  I mean, we have those amounts

3     there, because we have substantial obligations to pay

4     in the coming months.  And if it were not for those

5     obligations, we wouldn't have that much cash sitting on

6     our balance sheet.  And that is, I think, an important

7     perspective that the jury needs to understand.

8          Q.  How much cash would you have sitting on the

9     balance sheet today, if you know, just roughly?

10              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

11          A.  I mean, we may not have any at all.

12          Q.  Okay.

13          A.  I mean 

14          Q.  And does that -- in your estimation  reflect

15     an inability on the part of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

16     Company to satisfy a judgment of any size?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  Would you mind asking me that again?  I didn't

19     quite understand it.

20          Q.  Sure.  Yeah.  It was awkwardly worded.

21              The fact that you may have  let's assume

22     that you have no cash on hand as of today.  You said you

23     may not have any on hand.  Assume for me that you don't.

24     Does it, then, follow necessarily that R.J. Reynolds

25     Tobacco Company isn't capable of paying a judgment ofpgNbr=96
97

1     any size, whatsoever?

2          A.  No, that's not what that means.  I mean, if

3     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

4              So I think it just provides perspective for

5     people to make an appropriate judgment, you know,

6     analysis of this.

7          Q.  If the jury awards punitive damages in this

8     case, do you know whether that particular award will

9     be reported to the board of directors at Reynolds?

10          A.  I'm sure it will be.  I mean, we report all

11     judgments and verdicts in our 10-K filings and our "Q"

12     filings.

13          Q.  How about internally before those filings are

14     made?  Is there sort of an internal meeting where the

15     board of directors sits and gets a rundown on verdicts

16     that have been entered in the last 30 days or what have

17     you?

18          A.  I mean, we do brief the board at each of its

19     meetings.  And there are times that as different pieces

20     of news and information come across, that we provide them

21     briefings.  So, I mean, yes, they would be told, and they

22     would keep track of what's going on.

23          Q.  Those meetings that you referred to, are they

24      do they occur on a set recurring basis, monthly,

25     weekly or what have you?pgNbr=97
1          A.  It's not monthly.  It's not weekly.  The board

2     meetings themselves occur -- I think there's five

3     meetings a year.  In fact, we just had our annual meeting

4     this past Friday.  So we had an opportunity to talk to

5     our annual shareholders meetings of RAI, and then we had

6     a board meeting after that.  So they were briefed, then,

7     with respect to corporate matters.  And then there are

8     other meetings that occur every two or three months

9     throughout the year.

10          Q.  Was there a briefing last week at the board

11     meeting on the status of the Engle litigation and the

12     judgments entered against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

13          A.  Customarily, there's an opportunity to brief

14     the board on financial matters and legal matters and the

15     marketplace updates for all of our companies.  And so,

16     yes, I'm sure that that was discussed.  I mean, it's a

17     topic of interest to the board.

18          Q.  Were you at the meeting?

19          A.  Yes.

20          Q.  Do you know who carried out the discussion?

21     Was it you or someone else?

22          A.  It would have been someone else.

23          Q.  Who was that?

24          A.  Mark Holton.

25              MS. HENNINGER:  And this is why I'm just goingpgNbr=98
1     to 

2          Q.  Is he an employee?

3              MS. HENNINGER:  Well, I will let him identify

4     who he is, and then I'm going to the attorney/client

5     objection here.  Because I think once he identifies who

6     Mark Holton is, you will understand the objection.

7              MR. SCHULTZ:  (No response).

8          A.  He's the General Counsel for R.J. Reynolds

9     Tobacco Company.

10          Q.  So the report on Engle Progeny verdicts to the

11     body was given by the General Counsel, if I'm

12     understanding you correctly?

13          A.  By the General Counsel's Office.

14          Q.  Right.

15              And I take it minutes are taken of those

16     meetings?

17          A.  Yes.

18               (Exhibit 5 was marked for identification).

19          Q.  Let me take a look at Mr. Johnson's report

20     that was Exhibit 2 to his deposition, which we have

21     marked as Exhibit 5 to yours.  And, hopefully, we can

22     make short work of this.  Really what I'm interested in,

23     obviously, are points of disagreement or clarifications

24     that you would make.

25              You have been disclosed as someone who willpgNbr=99
100

1     testify or may testify regarding Mr. Johnson's opinions.

2     You've already given me a couple of clarifications

3     today.  Those are the sorts of things that I'm

4     interested in.  Maybe the best way to go about it is

5     for me to simply walk through this starting down at R.J.

6     Reynolds Tobacco Company.

7              First of all, let's start at data considered.

8     Having read Mr. Johnson's deposition and having seen

9     this report by him, do you believe there are data that

10     he should be considering that he has not considered as

11     outlined in this letter?

12          A.  No.  I mean, he's got the right data set for

13     the amounts for the information that he's looking for.

14     And he is appropriately looking at Reynolds Tobacco

15     company.  I think in some earlier  I had seen he was

16     using Reynolds American.  And I think that's the wrong

17     company for a lot of reasons that we just discussed.

18     So he's got the right information now.

19          Q.  If we look down under R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

20     Company and subsidiaries, he states:  "R.J. Reynolds

21     Tobacco Company and subsidiaries is a sound company with

22     at least $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in net sales for

23     each of the years 2006 through 2009."

24              Is there anything factually inaccurate about

25     that statement?pgNbr=100
101

1          A.  You know, he uses the word "sound."  And I'm

2     not sure exactly what he means by that.  You know, I will

3     tell you that, as you know, Reynolds Tobacco is the

4     largest operating company within Reynolds American.  And

5     Reynolds American, if you look at our rating for our debt

6     published by Standard & Poor's, we are investment grade.

7     But we are -- and we just got moved up to investment

8     grade in 2008.

9              And so we are at the bottom rung of investment

10     grade.  We are triple B minus.  And there are ten grades

11     between the top and the bottom, and we are at the

12     absolute bottom.  Now, if that's being sound in terms of

13     however Mr. Johnson uses that, we are investment grade

14     and that's fine.  But, I mean, I wouldn't want this to

15     be construed as sound as being really strong because,

16     obviously, the rating agencies don't have us notched up

17     any higher that the bottom rung within an investment

18     grade company.  That doesn't mean that we are 

19          Q.  Other than 

20          A.  Go ahead.

21          Q.  Yeah.

22              Other than any quibble you may have which you

23     described, and I think it's fair, but the term "sound,"

24     which is subject to interpretation, putting aside those

25     concerns, is there anything factually accurate aboutpgNbr=101
102

1     this first sentence that I read?

2          A.  No.  No, I don't believe so.

3          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

4          A.  I believe it is, yes.

5          Q.  At the end of 2009, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

6     Company and subsidiaries had over $**REDACTED

7     CONFIDENTIAL** in cash on hand.  Is that a true

8     statement 

9          A.  It is true.

10          Q.   factually?

11          A.  It's factually true, but it actually lacks

12     perspective or context, I mean, the payable piece of

13     this, Mr. Schultz.

14          Q.  Okay.  Right.

15              And you've described for me, for example, the

16     MSA payments that come due on April 15th.  I assume

17     there are other obligations, as well.  If we set that

18     aside, having talked about that already, are there other

19     omissions from this statement that you believe might

20     render it in some way misleading?

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          A.  It's factually accurate, but I don't think

23     it tells the whole story, and for the reasons that we

24     discussed.  It lacks perspective around the other

25     obligations that the company has.pgNbr=102
103

1          Q.  Okay.  And I guess my question is:  Is that

2     the only reason that it's not the whole story, or is

3     there another aspect to this that we need to know about

4     as well?

5          A.  No.  I mean, right now that's the only thing

6     that I'm trying to get on the record.

7          Q.  And all of those obligations that you referred

8     to are reflected in the financial documents?

9          A.  Yes, sir, they are  well, except the

10     contingent liability for the smoking and health cases for

11     which there are no amounts recorded.  So there's, you

12     know -- there are those liabilities that potentially

13     could exist to the company, and those aren't stated

14     liabilities or recorded liabilities in the financial

15     statements.

16          Q.  And those are not recorded because they are

17     not estimatable; is that correct?

18          A.  At the point in time of the balance sheet they

19     were not probable, nor were they estimatable.

20          Q.  How about today?

21          A.  Well, clearly, the Whiteley case came out after

22     the end of the year.  And we went back and recorded that

23     $2.2 million of payment.  So that liability was

24     ultimately recorded and then paid.

25          Q.  Is that the only one?pgNbr=103
104

1          A.  Individual smoking and health cases, I believe

2     so.

3          Q.  And are they  and if I understand you

4     correctly, those amounts are never recorded unless and

5     until a final nonappealable money judgment is entered,

6     correct?

7          A.  I mean, there may be some other circumstances,

8     but, generally, when appeals have been exhausted, then

9     we will pay or then payment has been made.

10          Q.  How are the bonds  how are the appeal bonds

11     recorded, or are they?

12          A.  They are recorded.  They are recorded as a

13     prepaid asset or as a deposit, a reduction in cash and

14     then they are in our deposit account or long-term assets.

15     So they are on the books.  They are just not  we don't

16     expense them, because the final -- the finality of that

17     bond has not been determined.

18          Q.I want to walk down -- it may be quickest

19     rather than me walking through 1 through 6.  I would

20     just ask you to take a look at Nos. 1 through 6 below

21     what we've just been reading, and you tell me if there

22     are any figures that you disagree with.

23          A.  (No response).

24          Q.  Let me restate that.

25              That you feel are in and of themselvespgNbr=104
105

1     factually inaccurate.

2          A.  Yeah.  The first one, it's not $ **REDACTED

3     CONFIDENTIAL**.  It's $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  And

4     he's got that right on his  in the chart.  He just made

5     a mistake and put the wrong number in his letter.  It's

6     different in two places.  And I think Ms. Henninger

7     pointed that out to him in his deposition.

8          Q.  Right.

9          A.  Okay.  The net sales  I mean, that's just

10     an arithmetic average.  And I won't get into all of the

11     roundings and stuff like that, but that's $**REDACTED

12     CONFIDENTIAL** divided by 365.  Net income is accurate.

13     Net worth is accurate.  Cash on hand is accurate.  And

14     capital expenditures are accurate.  And, again, they are

15     accurate  it's an accurate lift from our financial

16     statement.  It just lacks perspective.

17          Q.  If I take all six of these items, correcting

18     the **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** where it belongs, if I

19     take all six of those, are they potentially misleading

20     or not telling the whole story  I think to use your

21     words  again, only because they don't talk about or

22     don't reflect the obligations; or are there some other

23     reasons of why these numbers might tell less than the

24     whole story?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.pgNbr=105
106

1          A.  Well, you know, using numbers  I mean, you

2     use numbers for different purposes.  Okay.  And if I were

3      I mean, I'm a businessperson.  And if I had this, and

4     I had to make some judgment about a company, whether to

5     invest in it or to provide awards, I mean, this is

6     actually a pretty scant amount of information to

7     understand all that stuff.

8              I mean, I think that there is an obligation, or

9     there should be an obligation, for people to understand

10     the business a bit more than just to have six pieces of

11     information out there to determine what the company has

12     done or what it's able to do financially.

13              So, I mean, I, personally, think that there's

14     perspective needed.  And I'm not  well, I guess I am

15     kind of criticizing Mr. Johnson because he's an

16     economist.  He's a real big picture guy.  And maybe this

17     is adequate for him to understand what's -- you know, to

18     provide that type of information.  I'm more -- well, my

19     day job is being responsible for finances at Reynolds

20     American, and I'm also a CPA.

21              So I actually always think that there's

22     perspective that's required around these things, talking

23     about the business, the trends, you know, what may happen

24     in the future; those kinds of things, the liabilities,

25     both stated and contingent that are out there topgNbr=106
107

1     basically give a comprehensive view, a brief

2     comprehensive view, of the company in terms of its

3     ability to pay a punitive award.

4          Q.  Why don't we do this  and I think that you

5     just covered a few of the specifics that you would add

6     in order to bring clarity or comprehensiveness to this

7     endeavor.

8              I want you to assume for me that we have stood

9     up in opening statement to the punitive damages phase

10     of this trial and told the jury, a jury who's already

11     decided, that R.J. Reynolds deserves punishment and

12     deterrence.  And that we feel that $20 million would be

13     an appropriate amount of money to punish and deter R.J.

14     Reynolds for the harm that the jury has found in this

15     particular case?

16              Tell me, in addition to what we see here with

17     these six items, what information do you think the jury

18     should have in addition to those in order to make a fair

19     assessment of Reynolds' ability to pay a punitive damage

20     award of that size.

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          A.  Well, I think they need to understand the 

23     I mean, what Mr. Johnson has displayed here are big

24     members, big numbers on the cash, you know, big net

25     sales; all of those kinds of -- and, you know, kind ofpgNbr=107
108

1     net income, net worth, the cash on hand.  He never really

2     talked about any obligations that the company has, or the

3     result of what  you know, that punitive damages, large

4     punitive damages, may spur other awards of that, and may

5     actually may invite other cases, and may invite more

6     lawsuits against the company.

7              And we have already talked about that.  And I

8     understand that  I mean, sitting here today, I can't

9     point out where those things -- you know, any examples of

10     that.  But I do think that's a possibility.  And I think

11     he's not  he's presenting a point of view, and I

12     understand that's his job.  And I'm trying to present a

13     more balanced point of view to, you know, not only the

14     assets of the company, but also its obligations and its

15     liabilities.

16          Q.  Okay.  I discerned out of that response two --

17     and there may be more, and I want you to help me walk

18     through it -- two sort of overarching omissions, if you

19     will, or bits of information that you would share with

20     the jury in order to give them the bigger picture.  One

21     was the obligations; two was this notion that perhaps it

22     would invite other lawsuits against the company, which

23     then might result in more awards that will have, I

24     suppose, the same effects.  So let me focus on the

25     obligations.pgNbr=108
109

1              Again, assuming that we have asked this jury

2     to award $20 million in punitive damages, what

3     obligations would you describe to this jury in order to

4     help explain or clarify R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's

5     ability to pay a punitive damage verdict of that size?

6          A.  Well, the obligations to the various states.

7     I mean, that $2.4 billion is sitting on the balance

8     sheet.  I mean, on January 1st, if there were no sales by

9     the Reynolds Tobacco Company of cigarettes subsequent to

10     that, they wouldn't have enough money to pay those MSA

11     obligations.  Okay.

12              And I think that's an important distinction.

13     And I don't disagree with Mr. Johnson that the cash flows

14     that -- as the company goes forward it earns some cash

15     flows.  But at December 31st there's actually a perfect

16     match between obligations for 2009 and cash to pay for

17     those things, the cash that's been collected.

18              And at that point we're at  the Reynolds

19     Tobacco company is at a deficit in terms of its

20     obligations to pay.  And its only the continuing

21     operations that allow it to generate enough funds to meet

22     those obligations.  I'm not saying that's 

23          Q.  And if I had 

24          A.  Go ahead.  I'm done.

25          Q.  If you knew on December 31st of 2009 that apgNbr=109
110

1     jury in May of 2010 was going to award a $20 million

2     punitive damages award that RJR was required to pay,

3     you could have just booked another $20 million onto that

4     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** couldn't you?

5              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

6          A.  The **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** is cash.  So, no,

7     we wouldn't have booked it onto that.

8              I don't think I understand.

9          Q.  Well, it's not a coincidence that the cash on

10     hand at the end of the year is equal to the amount

11     that's going to be paid in April, is it?

12          A.  When you say "a coincidence" --

13          Q.  Right.

14              I mean, there's a reason they match.  RJR

15     makes the numbers match, correct, the cash on hand at

16     the end of the year versus the obligations that will

17     come due on April 15th?

18          A.  We collect that.  Reynolds Tobacco collects

19     that cash beginning with their sales in  and this is

20     for the year 2009.  So every sale that they make during

21     2009, they collect some money.  It's actually about 70

22     cents a pack.  Okay.  And they accumulate that cash

23     during the year.  And Mr. Johnson said, well, we expense

24     all of that.  And he's absolutely right about that.  We

25     expense that as master settlement payments.pgNbr=110
Ill

1              But what he left off was that those payments

2     aren't made.  And so the expense is recorded, but a

3     liability is created.  And that liability is $**REDACTED

4     CONFIDENTIAL** at the end of 2009.  And the cash from all

5     of those sales resides in the cash account at $

6     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.

7              I think he hasn't really educated  he's not

8     providing an educational recitation of how these

9     transactions work in order to give people a context

10     around all of this.

11          Q.  You mentioned the MSA, and I assume that

12     includes the various state agreements as well.  Are

13     there other obligations that you have in mind when you

14     use this term "obligations"?

15          A.  There's a growers settlement that's wrapped up

16     in all of this, but there's an offset for that within the

17     MSA.  And then once the growers settlement is paid out 

18     I think that's in 2014 -- then the MSA payments come back

19     in.  So, largely, it's all  it's the MSA and the four

20     separately settling states.

21              So, I mean, you can probably just forget about

22     this growers settlement since it doesn't really  it

23     just changes where the money goes with respect to the

24     states versus the farmers.  But, in total, the amount of

25     money that the companies pay out, us and the other peoplepgNbr=111
112

1     that are a party to these agreements, is the same.

2          Q.  The other bit of information that I discerned

3     from your previous response that you would share with

4     the jury that we have already talked about is this

5     notion that large awards would invite additional or

6     future filings.

7              Have we discussed that to your satisfaction?

8              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

9          A.  Yeah, I suppose so.  I mean, I just think 

10     I mean, my belief  and this is actually, probably a

11     nonfinancial belief.  This is a belief as a businessman.

12     That when there are issues that are made public, that it

13     tends to bring forward more challenges or suits.  And,

14     you know, you can probably say that that's  and I can't

15     expect or point to anything specific in the tobacco

16     industry.

17              But, certainly, you know, if you look generally

18     of what's occurred in the past year or so, if you think

19     about Toyota and some of these things, I mean, there's 

20     all of a sudden there were a handful of these things and

21     now there's  well, substantially more than that.

22     Because I think they believe that there is money to be

23     had from Toyota.  And I think that, you know, perhaps a

24     large punitive award or a punitive award of any nature

25     may incent people to bring more suits to see if they canpgNbr=112
113

1     be successful.

2              That's just speculation on my part,

3     Mr. Schultz, but it seems to me to be logical.

4          Q.  Okay.  And aside from those two sort of big

5     picture note items, the obligations and the invitation

6     of future lawsuits, are there other omissions or other

7     sets of information that you would add to the six that

8     we see in Mr. Johnson's report if you wanted to give the

9     jury a full picture of RJR's ability to pay the punitive

10     damages award as I've described?

11              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

12          A.  I think that, you know, a little bit of

13     information about, you know, the company, how it's in the

14     marketplace; those kinds of things.  I mean, that might

15     be useful as well from a financial standpoint and if

16     asked to do.  So I might talk about that, might provide

17     some perspective around it.

18          Q.  Okay.  Can you flesh that out for me a little

19     bit, and tell me what you're referring to in terms of

20     how the company has performed in the marketplace?

21          A.  I mean, with respect to how our brands have

22     performed, you know, over the years  I mean, you know,

23     although the market share has been stable for the last

24     two years  I mean, of course, we're a substantially

25     smaller company today than we were years ago.pgNbr=113
114

1              You know, the trading environment, and the

2     restrictions, and all of the smoking bans, and those

3     kinds of things, and the excise tax environment I think

4     might be of interest to a jury.  So I would think that

5     that would be good information for them to have.

6          Q.  Okay.  Any other sets of information like that

7     that you think the jury should have in order to properly

8     assess RJR's ability to pay?

9              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.

10          A.  I can't think of any at this point.

11          Q.  How about the need for deterrence?  I'm

12     guessing that that's where the Corporate Responsibility

13     Report comes in; is that right?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  Well, I mean, if you're saying and if the

16     allegation -- if the reason that we are in  that

17     Reynolds Tobacco is in this lawsuit is because of conduct

18     in the forties and fifties and sixties, which is, I

19     gather, from the discussion we had actually at the start

20     of this deposition, then I think that there actually have

21     been significant changes that have occurred at the

22     company in the nineties.  I mean, I mentioned that "Right

23     Decisions Right Now," that you know, started in 1991, I

24     believe, and there were probably some efforts in advance

25     of that.pgNbr=114
115

1              The Master Settlement Agreement provides a

2     lot of, you know, language around responsible marketing

3     and advertising, where you can do that, how you can do

4     that.  And then the FDA bill that was just enacted in

5     June of last year also provides some additional

6     restrictions.

7              So if we are talking about deterrence from

8     today going forward, or is the deterrence really from the

9     conduct that you're alleging that has occurred back in

10     the forties and fifties  and I would say that there's

11     plenty of things that have changed since the forties and

12     fifties in terms of the way that we advertise and market

13     our products today versus what it may have been back

14     then.

15          Q.  Okay.  And what changes do you have in mind

16     when you make that statement?

17          A.  Well, for instance, the Master Settlement

18     Agreement that was signed, which everybody  I mean, I

19     won't say that everybody voluntarily signed that.  When

20     I say "everybody," the manufacturers voluntarily signed

21     that.  We gave up our  we, the tobacco companies, gave

22     up our ability to do outdoor advertising on billboards

23     and taxicabs and those kinds of things.  So that's

24     something that we basically agreed not to do.

25              So prior to that, you know, there were  youpgNbr=115
116

1     could run the advertisements on billboards as people

2     drove down the highway.  Today, you don't see any of

3     those for those people that have signed the Master

4     Settlement Agreement.  Now, for some of the companies

5     that are out there doing it who aren't signatories, they

6     are still doing that.  And there's just restrictions of

7     that type that I might point out.

8          Q.  Okay, outdoor advertising.

9              Any others that you can think of in

10     differences between the marketing of products today

11     versus the forties and fifties?

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

13          A.  I'm sure there are others.  I just don't have

14     them off the top of my mind right now, Mr. Schultz.

15          Q.  Okay.  I'm only interested in the ones that

16     you would testify to.

17          A.  I understand.  And if I had them at the tip of

18     my tongue, I would certainly talk to you about them.

19          Q.  Let me take a look, if we can, Mr. Adams, at

20      let me ask you, first of all:  You have an

21       appointment at some point, right  2 2                           A.  No.

23          Q.   today?

24          A.  No, I do not; that got cleared.

25          Q.  Okay.  I still don't expect to go a whole lotpgNbr=116
117

1     longer.  Maybe we can take a five minutes now.  And, in

2     fact, I'm kind of going to the homestretch as it is.

3          A.  That's fine.

4              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.  I guess since you're

5     going into the homestretch, we will forego lunch and

6     then push forward.  And if we go too much longer, then

7     we can break for lunch?

8              MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah.  I wouldn't expect more

9     than a half-hour or so.

10              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.  Then give us five

11     minutes.  All right?

12              MR. SCHULTZ:  All right.

13               (Recess taken).

14     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

15          Q.  Okay.  Let's take a look at the slides that

16     Mr. Johnson attached to his report.

17          A.  Yes.

18          Q.  The first one is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

19     Company's subsidiaries, net sales from 2006 to 2009?

20          A.  Yes.

21          Q.  Any factual inaccuracies on that slide?

22          A.  Nothing factually inaccurate that I can tell.

23          Q.  How about the next slide on net income?

24          A.  That appears to be accurate as well.

25              Do you happen to know what criteriapgNbr=117
118

1     Mr. Johnson used for picking the number that he did?

2     I mean, not  or the categories, the categories of

3     looking at things.

4          Q.  No.  What would you add?

5          A.  Well, you know, I will probably put operating

6     income in some of the elements that comprise  I mean,

7     net sales is a big number.  And it doesn't really --

8     other than taking excise taxes and some things like that

9     out, it doesn't really speak to the costs that are

10     associated with the business.

11          Q.  What is the difference between the net income

12     and the operating income?

13          A.  Interest expense, interest income, taxes.

14     Taxes are a big number; those kinds of things.  I mean,

15     I'm just not used to seeing such a -- you know, maybe

16     we're looking at it for different purposes.  But,

17     generally, when I look at companies and I want to

18     understand their financial position, I look for a lot

19     more information than Mr. Johnson is proposing here or

20     has displayed here, I should say.

21          Q.  Is operating income listed as a line item in

22     the financials, or is that something that you have to

23     do math to get to?

24          A.  No.  It's listed in these financial statements,

25     and it's a number that we publish externally at ReynoldspgNbr=118
119

1     American.

2          Q.  So do you have handy the operating income for

3     2009 for RJRT?

4          A.  Yes, it's a **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.

5          Q.  Well, I've got net income as $**REDACTED

6     CONFIDENTIAL**  

7          A.  Right.

8          Q.   for the same period of time.

9              I thought that you  if I understood

10     correctly, operating income would deduct out or would

11     include more expenses so that it would be a smaller

12     number  I would have guessed  based on what you were

13     telling me?

14          A.  No.  No.  I mean, this is actually a larger

15     number.  I mean, I'm just saying that there's some

16     context around here that you just  you know, you have

17     a few data points that Mr. Johnson has thrown out there.

18     And I think to gain an understanding of a business, which

19     is what I would think that, you know, a jury  if they

20     are going to decide about financial consequences, they

21     need to understand the business a little bit better.

22              And I'm just merely suggesting that you look

23     at some other financial information, other than the few

24     things that Mr. Johnson has put forward.  And operating

25     income is one of those things, and it's a bigger numberpgNbr=119
120

1     than net income.

2          Q.  And that is the list that I was trying to get

3     to a few minutes ago when we talked about obligations

4     and perspective future lawsuits.  So operating income is

5     another figure that you think that the jury should see.

6     Tell me what other figures it should see to get the

7     whole picture.

8          A.  MSA payments.  I think that's under

9     "obligations," probably.  And the MSA payments under --

10     if you look at the financial statement, Mr. Schultz,

11     under "cost of products sold," the cost of products sold

12     for 2009 is $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  And the

13     payments to the states -- this is in a footnote.  It's on

14     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of the financial statements for

15     2009.

16          Q.  Okay.

17          A.  The payment to the states that year  the

18     expenses, excuse me, were $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  Do

19     you see that?

20          Q.  Yes, I see that.

21          A.  It's at the bottom of the page?

22          Q.  Yes.

23          A.  I think some of that type of information is

24     actually good contextual information, if you will, to

25     have the jury understand more about these companies.pgNbr=120
121

1          Q.  Do you think that  and, again, I will go

2     back to my hypothetical where we have asked for a

3     $20 million punitive damages award.

4              It's your position that the jury would have to

5     know how much money R.J. Reynolds pays in MSA payments

6     in order to know whether R.J. Reynolds could afford a

7     $20 million punitive damages award?

8          A.  Well, you know, they can kind of decide what

9     they want to decide.  It just seems to me that if you

10     provide them a bit more information, maybe they can come

11     up with what an appropriate amount might be.  So, I mean,

12     said differently; if we didn't have the MSA, and we

13     didn't have $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of cash on the

14     balance sheet at the end of December of 2009  assume it

15     was zero.  You know, hypothetically if it's zero, is the

16     jury likely to have a  you know, is there an award

17     likely to be closer to zero; or if it's $ **REDACTED

18     CONFIDENTIAL**, you know, further up the scale.  I mean,

19     I don't know.

20              I just think that  and I'm a financial guy.

21     Okay.  I just actually look to see more information as

22     opposed to less information to make an informed judgment.

23     And then different people have different views, but my

24     view is that I like more information.

25          Q.  Right.pgNbr=121
122

1              Zero would be misleading, too, wouldn't it?

2     Zero might imply no ability to pay when we both know

3     that R.J. Reynolds could afford to pay a $20 million

4     award, right?

5              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

6          A.  Well, it's possible that, yeah, that that would

7     be misleading.  But, again, with the context around it,

8     if you don't have  if you have zero cash, and you don't

9     have $2.4 billion of liabilities, then, you know, maybe

10     you still have the ability to pay.

11          Q.  And you can make that point, can you not,

12     simply by telling the jury that there are $2.4 million

13     in liabilities or obligations?  You don't have to tell

14     them that there are MSA payments made for smoking and

15     health litigation in order to make that point, do you?

16              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

17          A.  Well, I don't know how you  well, I don't

18     know how you tell them that it's not MSA related because

19     it's -- I mean, if this was a one-time event, I could

20     understand it.  You don't really need to talk about this.

21     But this is an ongoing obligation that the company has

22     with every -- you know, it's part of its doing -- it's

23     a part of doing business, and it has been for more than

24     a decade now.

25              So I don't really see how you can  and it'spgNbr=122
123

1     changed the way the company, you know, approaches the way

2     it does business.  It's changed its market share.  It

3     changed everything about the company since this thing

4     came into place.  So I don't very well see how you cannot

5     talk about it.  I mean, it's fundamental to the business.

6     It's in the DNA now.

7          Q.  But my question is a little bit different and

8     more focused than that.  The jury is not making a

9     decision on whether to invest in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

10     Company.  The jury is making a decision about what

11     amount of money would sufficiently punish or deter R.J.

12     Reynolds including, of course, the need to do so.

13              Now, I understand when you say, look, you're

14     looking at a **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** number at the end

15     of 2009, and ya'll tell the jury that **REDACTED

16     CONFIDENTIAL** is owed in April, that that can be

17     misleading.  I understand that.  My question is very

18     focused, though.

19              Why would have to tell them what the $

20     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** is owed for in order to make

21     that point?

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

23          A.  Well, I mean, I would believe that if they

24     think this is just a one-time event, that they think,

25     well, once they get -- they may believe, the jury maypgNbr=123
124

1     believe, that once they get passed this 2.4, however they

2     are going to do it, they got clear sailing, and they are

3     going to accumulate another $  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.

4     And that's simply not the case.

5              I mean, if you strip out all of this MSA stuff

6      and it's throughout the financial statement.  I mean,

7     the MSA payments are built into the costs, which means

8     your inventories are higher than that.  It's built into

9     some of the receivables.  I mean, it's throughout the

10     financial statement specifically on the income statement

11     side.  And I think it's just a mission.  It's probably,

12     you know, a material fact to the jury.

13              I mean, if it weren't for the MSA, our sales

14     wouldn't be $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  They would be

15     $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** less $**REDACTED

16     CONFIDENTIAL** of expense.  I mean, that's significant.

17          Q.  Is there a difference, Mr. Adams, that would

18     inform RJR's ability to pay a $20 billion punitive

19     damage award?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  That's up to the jury to decide.  I just think

22     that these --

23          Q.  Is it your understanding that 

24          A.  Excuse me.  I just think these numbers on the

25     MSA, Mr. Schultz, are so large.  They inflate everything,pgNbr=124
125

1     and it's a little  you know, a good analogy is federal

2     excise taxes.  Okay.  Federal excise taxes are also a

3     substantial amount.  We only got seven months' of effect

4     in 2009, but they were $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  Now,

5     they are netted.  They are taken out of net sales.

6              So said differently:  If net sales were

7     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** , if you included the excise

8     taxes, if they were grossed up by the excise taxes, it

9     would be $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of revenue if you

10     only added back the excise taxes.  Okay.  We don't do

11     that.  We subtract them out to get the $ **REDACTED

12     CONFIDENTIAL**.  What I'm suggesting is that the MSA is

13     built into the sales price of cigarettes and is included

14     in the net sales, very much like excise taxes.  The

15     difference being it's included in the net sales, and it's

16     included in cost of sales.

17              So both of those numbers are inflated by

18     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in 2009.  And it just makes

19     the numbers appear so much larger.  And I think it just

20     provides  you know, talking about that provides a

21     little bit of context to people that this money really

22     isn't the company's to keep.  They just steward it for a

23     period of time, a year, and they pass it on to the

24     various states.

25              That's all I'm suggesting here.pgNbr=125
126

1          Q.  All right.  You may have lost me, but I want

2     to make sure I understand.

3              So when you say the sales figure, for example,

4     without the MSA would be two-and-a-half billion less,

5     you're saying that because the anticipated two-and-

6     a-half billion of obligation under the MSA is built into

7     the price of a pack of cigarettes?

8          A.  That's correct.  Right.

9          Q.  Okay.

10          A.  And so $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** is higher by

11     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  And, similarly, the cost of

12     products sold of $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** is higher by

13     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**, because that's where the MSA

14     payments are.  The bottom line result is the same.  It's

15     just that the numbers all kind of come down a bit.

16          Q.  And it's your understanding, then, that absent

17     the MSA -- and putting aside what might have happened

18     if you had actually gone to trial with all of the States

19     Attorneys General, that R.J. Reynolds would have kept

20     the price of cigarettes otherwise flat?

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          Q.  RJR wouldn't have 

23          A.  Well, no.  I would have expected that the price

24     of cigarettes would have continued to go up.  And it

25     would have gone up because of their state excise taxes.pgNbr=126
127

1     And historically the manufacturers have taken price

2     increases to offset the volume declines that have been in

3     the business, as I mentioned earlier, since 1981.

4              So as the volumes are coming down, they take 

5     the manufacturers have taken price increases to offset

6     those volume declines to the extent that they can.

7          Q.  How does that work?  Is there a point of

8     diminishing returns where you say, look, we can only

9     increase it so much, or we're going to lose existing

10     customers because of increases?

11          A.  Well, we have already reached that point.

12     Well, I mean, some of the -- are you familiar at all with

13     the MSA, Mr. Schultz?

14          Q.  Yes.

15          A.  Okay.  Then you know that the original

16     participating manufacturers  the ones that are here

17     today are Reynolds and Philip Morris and Lorillard 

18     have a different payment scheme and structure, which

19     means that they pay more than subsequent participating

20     manufacturers, and actually more still than the

21     nonparticipating manufacturers.

22              So the nonparticipating manufacturers actually

23     are able to price their products significantly lower than

24     Reynolds or Lorillard or Philip Morris, because they

25     don't have the same payment obligations, and in somepgNbr=127
128

1     cases no payment.  Well, actually, they have an

2     obligation.  They just aren't making payments under the

3     Master Settlement Agreement.

4              And a price difference of 70 cents that we're

5     currently paying versus somebody that's not paying any of

6     that probably translates to  well, at least that much,

7     maybe more, in terms of the price of cigarettes that some

8     of these other nonparticipating manufacturers are able to

9     sell their products for, which means that the companies

10     lose market share and have since 1999.

11          Q.  Yeah.  I guess my question had a little bit

12     different focus.

13              If I understand you, you're saying, look, when

14     we see volume declines, we raise the price of cigarettes

15     in order to make up for the decline in volume.  And I'm

16     asking you:  Is there a point where that strategy,

17     standing alone, backfires on you because people say,

18     look, we're not just going to buy these anymore?  And

19     you decide, look, a price increase won't work to offset

20     volume declines because we can't increase the prices

21     anymore?

22          A.  Well, I mean, there's always that tension in

23     the system.  And the circumstances that I've described

24     to you is that because these MSA costs  well, not only

25     do you have declining volume for R.J. Reynolds TobaccopgNbr=128
129

1     Company, but you have increasing costs of the MSA, that

2     three percent CPI adjustment that I spoke to you earlier

3     about today.  And those two things in concert tend to

4     push the price, as well as state excise tax increases.

5     And federal excise taxes tend to push the price of our

6     cigarettes up.

7              And what I'm suggesting to you is that because

8     some of the other players don't have that MSA component

9     or aren't paying that, they  you know, we are unable

10     to raise our prices because their products are priced

11     so much lower than some of our products.  And so the

12     inability to make  to have price increases to offset

13     these volume declines is becoming more acute.

14          Q.I understand that now and thank you.

15              The MSA settlement terms and the payments made

16     under the MSA, do you understand those do not  those

17     payments are not in any way compensatory for the damages

18     that are being claimed in this lawsuit?  Do you

19     understand that?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  They are not related to this lawsuit, the MSA.

22     I mean, that was decided back in 1999.

23          Q.  Right.

24              And so I guess my point in asking that is:

25     You're not under the impression, are you, that somehowpgNbr=129
130

1     payments made by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company under the

2     MSA are, in some way, compensation for the damages that

3     are being sought in this lawsuit, compensatory or

4     punitive?

5              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

6          A.  Can you ask me that question again?  And can

7     you kind of break it down into two sentences?

8          Q.  Yeah.

9              We have claimed compensatory damages and

10     entitlement to punitive damages in the Walden lawsuit.

11          A.  Right.

12          Q.  Okay?

13          A.  Yes.

14          Q.  I just want to make sure that it's your

15     understanding that the money that is being paid out

16     pursuant to the MSA doesn't compensate, in any way, for

17     individual smoking and health lawsuits like the Walden

18     suit.  And I'm talking about the Walden suit in

19     particular.

20          A.  Right.

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          A.  Yeah, that's my understanding.  Yes.

23          Q.  And do you understand that the amount of

24     punitive damages to be awarded in the Walden lawsuit --

25     if any such damages are to be awarded -- is related onlypgNbr=130
131

1     to harm suffered by Mr. Walden, not harms suffered by

2     other people?  Do you understand that?

3              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

4          A.  Yes.  I mean, that was my understanding; yes,

5     or is my understanding, I should say.

6          Q.  Can we take a look at the net income slide

7     again.  I think I got your answer that these were all

8     accurate numbers.  I just want to make sure.

9          A.  Yes.  That's right, these are accurate numbers.

10          Q.  You mentioned operating income is another line

11     item that you said the jury should see.  You mentioned

12     MSA payments, which I think we had covered under

13     obligations previously.

14              Are there other line items like operating

15     income that you think the jury should see?

16          A.  Tobacco settlement, liabilities.  On the

17     balance sheet Mr. Johnson has put the cash down.  All I'm

18     suggesting is that the claim against most of that cash

19     is  well, actually, more than most all of it, plus some

20     is to tobacco settlement accruals.

21              It's the second line down, and the largest item

22     under "current liabilities" is on page 4.

23          Q.  Right.  Any others?

24          A.  Yeah.  Well, and then the other thing is just

25     the  if you look into the footnotes, you will see thepgNbr=131
132

1     number of cases that are filed against the company.  And,

2     actually, even under Engle Progeny I think it's eight

3     or 9,000.  I mean, I can look, but it's the -- I mean,

4     following on my earlier testimony that, you know, what's

5     done here may have implications across the balance of the

6     cases.

7              I mean, you've been throwing out a $20 million

8     award.  Well, if there's a $20 million award in each of

9     these cases that's presented -- and we are talking about

10     amounts that the company is, frankly, incapable of  I

11     mean, in my opinion incapable of paying and potentially

12     could bankrupt the company if all that came to fruition.

13          Q.  Right.

14              And is that something that you, as you sit

15     here today, if you were permitted by the Court to

16     testify to, you would testify to?

17          A.  Yeah.  I mean, they need to understand that the

18     consequences of this verdict may reach beyond this case

19     itself.

20          Q.  Right.

21              And I only ask the question, Mr. Adams  our

22     position will be none of that is relevant; in fact, it's

23     misleading to the jury.  But I wouldn't even raise it

24     with the Court if you didn't plan on giving the

25     testimony.  That's why I'm asking you the question, justpgNbr=132
133

1     so you know.  I wasn't trying to put you on the spot

2     over it. But if you say you want to testify to it, then

3     I know I would have to take it up with the Court.

4              MS. HENNINGER:  You know, he's  I mean, you

5     know, the whole  I think you've already acknowledged

6     that he doesn't know exactly what he is going to be

7     asked.  So...

8          Q.  Let's take a look at the net worth slide, Mr.

9     Johnson's slide.

10              MR. SCHULTZ:  And I think you guys, you know,

11     I've already gone a half hour when I said it would only

12     be a half hour.  And I've got maybe a dozen or more

13     questions on the financial statement.  I still have

14     a couple of questions on the community corporate

15     responsibility bit.  Maybe we should take a break for a

16     half hour or 40 minutes.

17              I really don't think I'll go a whole lot

18     longer than an hour certainly, but I don't think we're

19     going to make it through without a lunch break.

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.  Off the record.

21               (Lunch recess taken 1:15 p.m. to 1:45 p.m.)

22     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

23          Q.  Okay.  Mr. Adams, let's walk quickly, I hope,

24     through the remaining slides of Mr. Johnson's.  I may

25     have asked you about net worth.  Let me ask you again,pgNbr=133
134

1     just in case, whether his slide correctly reflects the

2     net worth of the company.

3          A.  It does correctly reflect the net worth of the

4     company.

5          Q.  The next slide in my stack is:  "Cash on

6     hand."

7          A.  Those are accurate amounts of cash on hand as

8     depicted on the balance sheet.  Again, I mean, I would 

9     as we have talked  I mean, I would add some things

10     around payables and the liabilities that the company

11     owes.  The reason that has that much cash is because

12     the absence of that, I think, makes it a bit misleading.

13          Q.  Okay.  And did you tell me in 2010 the MSA

14     payment in April will be $2.4 billion?

15          A.  I think we paid $2.2 billion.

16          Q.  How about in 2008, did you  strike that.

17              Let me ask you this:  It seems like a few

18     minutes ago you said that you had payables of that

19     amount plus some.  That amount being the amount

20     reflected on your year-end report.  I'm wondering if you

21     have payables or obligations that exceed cash on hand at

22     the end of the year.  How do you make up the difference?

23          A.  Well, as I -- do you want me to explain it?

24          Q.  Did the question make sense?

25          A.  Yes, it does.  Okay.pgNbr=134
135

1              The way that you make it up is that the cash

2     that we collect  remember, I mentioned that the company

3     collects about 70 cents a pack, and all of the cigarettes

4     that it sells during the year in  well, the 70 cents a

5     pack that's collected between January and April doesn't

6     have to be paid until the following April 15th.

7              So you get a little bit of an advance to make

8     up for that shortfall, but it's the timing of the payment

9     that actually makes -- allows it to work.

10          Q.  On Mr. Johnson's slide he has a footnote that

11     says:  "Cash and cash equivalent (can be converted to

12     cash in less than 90 days)."  Is that accurate?

13          A.  Yes.  That's the standard definition of cash

14     that we use for  that's the definition of cash under

15     publicly-reporting companies.

16          Q.  Now, going back to 2006 with $**REDACTED

17     CONFIDENTIAL** of cash on hand, does it follow that RJR

18     was paying less in MSA payments in 2007, and that's why

19     there was less cash on hand in 2006 than there was in

20     2009?

21          A.  Would you ask me that question again?  I think

22     I got confused.

23          Q.  Sure.  Yeah.

24              I've gathered, perhaps erroneously, that the

25     cash on hand at the end of the year correlates to thepgNbr=135
136

1     amount that you will have to pay under the MSA, and I

2     suppose other potential obligations as well.

3              My question is:  Does the fact that there was

4     $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** on hand at the end of 2006

5      does that mean that you made a smaller MSA payment in

6     2007 than you would expect to in 2010, hence the

7     disparity in cash on hand?

8          A.  I need to take a look at that.  Actually, I

9     think what happened was that the amounts of -- there's

10     also a category of cash, but it's held in longer-term

11     investments.  And our long-term investments back then 

12     I'm doing this from memory  were about a **REDACTED

13     CONFIDENTIAL**.  So that, plus the cash that's on hand

14     that Mr. Johnson shows of **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**,

15     would have made it about the amount of the payment or a

16     bit less.

17              So said differently:  I mean, the cash that

18     he's displaying here, as you pointed out, Mr. Schultz,

19     says:  "Can be converted to cash in less than 90 days."

20     I believe back in 2006 and actually even into 2007, we

21     saw that we had investments that had a longer duration

22     than 90 days.  And those things are characterized as

23     short-term investments as opposed to cash, because by

24     their terms you can't convert them to cash.

25              Do you understand that?pgNbr=136
137

1          Q.  Yes.

2          A.  Okay.

3          Q.  Yes.

4          A.  So it's possible that we had less  we had

5     substantially higher  the obligations were higher than

6     they are today because we sold more cigarettes.  Okay.

7     So the ability to basically convert those short-term

8     investments, their natural cycle of coming down would be

9     slightly longer than 90 days, which would put it in that

10     first 15 days of April, which those maturities would then

11     be available to pay our MSA obligation.

12          Q.  Why did that change if there was  was there

13     some management level decision of, look, let's convert

14     all of this or hold it as cash as opposed to using the

15     short-term investments starting in 2008?

16          A.  Well, back then I think the short-term

17     investment rates perhaps were more attractive.  And so

18     the company  I wasn't enrolled at the time.  I was

19     actually working on something different at the company.

20     But my belief is that the interest rates that were

21     available to go a bit beyond 90 days were higher, and

22     that the company might have enjoyed slightly more

23     interest income as a result of going longer.

24              Today the differences are negligible.  So we

25     tend to stay relatively short in treasuries.pgNbr=137
138

1          Q.  If we can talk, in short, of the generalities

2     just to help me understand where the money goes, if you

3     will.  I'm looking at the end of 2009.  You have $

4     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in cash.  You have $**REDACTED

5     CONFIDENTIAL**  again, we're ballparking  that's

6     owed in mid-April.

7              Does all other cash that's not owed in mid-

8     April get passed up as a dividend to RAI?

9              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

10          A.  No.  I mean, some of it is used to pay for

11     equipment.  Some of it is used to just  there is

12     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in accounts payable.  They

13     tend to be relatively short.  Those are payments to

14     vendors and stuff like that for materials.

15              There's other current liabilities which are,

16     you know, payment disbursements and vacation accruals and

17     those kinds of things.  So it's really used for operating

18     the business.  It's just that the large chunk of that

19     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**  I mean, it's about

20     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**, as I recall, maybe a little

21     more than that that was used to make the master

22     settlement payment.

23              I mean, we were also having to make tax

24     payments during this period of time.  We also made a

25     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** plans in January of this year.pgNbr=138
139

1     Remember, I talked about  you talked about the pension

2     expense, and I said that was a reduction -- that was a

3     result of the losses in the pension plan.

4              We have an obligation by law to fund those

5     things back up and we're  and we also have the social

6     obligation for our retirement, our retirees that are out

7     there to make those payments.  So we did that in January

8     of this year.

9          Q.  And if I look over  and this is what I'm

10     really trying to drive at:  If you look two slides over

11     further down in the stack to "dividends paid," let me

12     ask you, first of all, do those appear to be accurate

13     numbers?

14          A.  Yes, they are accurate.

15          Q.  If R.J. Reynolds so chose -- and, certainly,

16     I'm not going to suggest to you whether it would be good

17     or bad financial management practice.  But if it chose

18     to, R.J. Reynolds could have paid in 2009 $ **REDACTED

19     CONFIDENTIAL** dividend to RAI.  And all other things

20     being equal, it would have then had $**REDACTED

21     CONFIDENTIAL** in cash on hand, right?  Do I have that

22     right?

23              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

24          A.  Well, it wasn't actually  ask me that again.

25     I wasn't quite following your accounting, Mr. Schultz.pgNbr=139
140

1          Q.  Do you have the cash on hand slide in front of

2     you?

3          A.  I just pulled it up.

4          Q.  Okay.  And, if you will, look on the 2009 cash

5     on hand, $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.

6          A.  Right.

7          Q.  And then if I look over at 2009, dividends

8     paid of $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**, my question is:  If

9     you took  if you decided or R.J. Reynolds, or RAI,

10     whoever sets the policy, decided that we are only going

11     to pay a dividend of $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** that

12     other $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**  all other things

13     being equal  would reside as cash, wouldn't it?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  If it weren't used for any  yeah, all 

16     everything else being equal, which is seldom the case,

17     it would have increased the cash balances.

18          Q.  Right.

19              And you told me, I think, that it's not really

20     the best financial management to have that much cash on

21     hand.  You keep it on hand because you know that you got

22     to pay it out in April, right?

23          A.  Right.  Well, it's a good idea to have cash on

24     hand or available to make the April payment.  I mean, the

25     consequences for not paying the April payment are ratherpgNbr=140
141

1     severe.  And so we tend to want to have that on hand and

2     available.  And it's just right now invests -- you know,

3     treasuries are yielding less than one-quarter of one

4     percent in interest.  So it's not yielding much of a

5     return, that cash sitting there.

6          Q.  Right.

7              My point in asking that question, Mr. Adams,

8     is:  I think a juror looking at this who says:  Hang on.

9     You've got $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** on cash on hand at

10     the end of 2009, but you've got to write a check in

11     mid-April for $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  Well, gosh,

12     RJR doesn't have any money, because it only had

13     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** and then it had to pay

14     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  But, in fact, you're also

15     paying another **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in dividends to

16     RAI, correct; in 2009 at least?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  Not out of that cash, not out of the cash at

19     the end of the year.  I mean, those dividends, I believe

20     are 

21          Q.  Where is it coming from?

22          A.  Well, it comes from their earnings, actually.

23     I mean, we were probably paying dividends that are

24     roughly equivalent to its earnings during the year.  I

25     mean, those things are made  I mean, I believe thatpgNbr=141
142

1     cash moves up radically during the year.  It's out of

2     payment at the end of the year.  I mean, clearly  well,

3     I mean, first of all, the RAI dividends are paid

4     quarterly.

5              Okay.  So there's not  Reynolds dividends

6     paid are not sitting  I mean, the **REDACTED

7     CONFIDENTIAL** in 2009 was not sitting there at the end

8     of December of 2009.  It was paid out earlier in the

9     year, or some portion of that was paid out earlier in the

10     year.

11          Q.  Are those paid out  do they generally divide

12     up equally, or are they based on performance of a given

13     quarter?

14          A.  I think it depends upon  again, it depends

15     upon the needs and other things that are going on within

16     the business.  I mean, there are times when -- you know,

17     back in 2006 and 2007 when we were drawing down our

18     investments, and they were actually funding some of the

19     need for cash, that changed in the balance sheet as

20     opposed to taking it from the  or accepting it from the

21     tobacco company.

22              There were -- I think it was in 2008 that we 

23     in the beginning of 2008 we were fully funded in our

24     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**   so a lot of it depends upon

25     the corporate needs, and it depends upon when debt ispgNbr=142
143

1     coming due and those kinds of things.

2              So I'm talking about  those are the big

3     dollar items, just trying to hit all  I mean, there are

4     lots of small stuff that goes on or smaller stuff.  So

5     it all depends upon what the cash needs are for Reynolds

6     American and whether that comes up permanently in the

7     form of a dividend, or on a temporary basis in the form

8     of a loan.

9          Q.  Let me ask you to look at the cash flows

10     statement or slide, excuse me, and tell me if those

11     numbers look accurate.

12          A.  They are accurate, but only talk about a piece

13     of the information.

14          Q.  Okay.  Can you elaborate on that?

15          A.  Oh, certainly.  If you look on **REDACTED

16     CONFIDENTIAL** of those financial statements, Mr.

17     Schultz, you will see that cash flow is comprised of

18     three distinct activities; one is operating activities.

19     And that is what Mr. Johnson has displayed here.  The

20     other is cash flow from or used in investing activities,

21     and those are things like capital expenditures, you know,

22     movements of the investments and those kinds of things.

23     And then there's, lastly, cash flows used in financing

24     activities.

25              And that's generally  as you can see there pgNbr=143
144

1     dividends, notes payable, investments from the parent,

2     which is money that's pushed back down to the company.

3     And so he's portrayed only a piece of that and -- I mean,

4     I would actually say he's portrayed the positive piece

5     of it.  But, you know, the real story is the change in

6     cash over the years that in 2009 our cash balances

7     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

8              Similarly, in 2008, the increase was larger.

9     It was $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  And in 2009 it was

10     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  And there's reasons for all

11     of that.  And that can be understood from a thorough

12     analysis of this particular cash flow statement, which is

13     just a bridge statement that gets you from the cash

14     balances from the end of one particular year to the cash

15     on hand at the following year.  And all I'm suggesting is

16     that Mr. Johnson only picked a piece of the puzzle here,

17     and it just doesn't tell the full story.

18          Q.  And so what would the proper number be for

19     2009, the one that does tell the whole story?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  Our cash **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.  That's the

22     result net change in cash.  That's the purpose of the

23     cash flow statement, to describe what element of the

24     business, and he's right.  We generated a   **REDACTED

25     CONFIDENTIAL** well, that's the number that we camepgNbr=144
145

1     up with as well  in operating cash flow.  We used

2     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** of it in investing activities,

3     and we used a **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** to pay dividends.

4     And when I say "we," I'm talking about the R.J. Reynolds

5     Tobacco Company now, paid those dividends **REDACTED

6     CONFIDENTIAL**

7              And, see, that's the thing that I think is

8     important.  It's important to understand why the

9     companies don't always do things financially the same

10     way, and there are reasons that dictate that.  You know,

11     if you look in 2007, as Mr. Johnson has noted on

12     here,**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**  so it moves both

13     directions from time to time, depending upon what's going

14     on in the Reynolds American business, as well as what's

15     going on in the Reynolds Tobacco business.

16          Q.  Tell me again what happened in 2007, why there

17     was no dividend payment.

18          A.  Well, I suspect it's actually really more of

19     what happened in 2006, and that -- and if you go back

20     there, you can  that was the year that Reynolds

21     American bought Conwood, now the American Snuff Company.

22     And there was a lot of financing that was going on then.

23     There was actually a pretty significant drawdown in

24     short-term investments.

25              And I think what happened was, is that it endedpgNbr=145
146

1     up that Reynolds had as much cash as it needed at any

2     particular point -- Reynolds American had enough cash

3     during that point in time that it didn't -- it either 

4     Reynolds Tobacco had either over-advanced dividends at

5     that time from the year before and were held in short-

6     term investments, and those investments were brought

7     down.  There was pension funding.  I mean, apparently,

8     they had all the bases covered and didn't need to

9     dividend the money up.

10              It's different  I guess the way that I would

11     say it is:  It's not a one size fits all year after year,

12     after year, after year, after year in terms of how these

13     things occur.  And there's nothing nefarious about that.

14     It's just that business is dynamic and things change over

15     time.  And there are just different business drivers as

16     we try to manage balance sheets and make them efficient

17     and satisfy our obligations and do those things.

18              And that, as much as anything else, dictates

19     how the cash is moved around and what form that movement

20     takes place.

21          Q.  And my question as a layperson coming at this

22     is not to suggest anything nefarious, but to ask it this

23     way:  If RAI had decided in 2007 it needed $500 million

24     in dividends, could it have gotten that amount of money

25     from RJRT in dividends?pgNbr=146

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

2          A.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

3              So these refinancings and perhaps bringing some

4     of those short-term balances down that were not on the

5     Reynolds' books provided the cash that was needed.

6          Q.I don't know if we've looked -- we did look at

7     the dividends paid, but I didn't ask you -- I may have.

8     Let me just ask you again.

9              Are all of those numbers accurate on the

10     dividends paid slide?

11          A.  Yes, those are looked straight from our

12     financial statements, the Reynolds financial statements.

13          Q.  Okay.  And how about the capital expenditures

14     on the following slide?

15          A.  Those are accurate at the top as well.  And,

16     again, those are from our financial statements.

17          Q.  What would be represented in capital

18     expenditures, just generally speaking?

19          A.  Acquisition of things that have a life longer

20     than one year.  So it's machinery, equipment; and in the

21     case of 2006 and 2007, probably some software.  We

22     implemented S.A.P.

23          Q.  Hang on.  I'm sorry.

24          A.  That's all right.

25               (Phone interruption).pgNbr=147
148

1          Q.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

2          A.  Things capital in nature; machinery, equipment;

3     software that actually has a useful life beyond a year.

4     I mean, those kinds of things; things that have a longer

5     life.

6          Q.  And how about advertising expenditures on the

7     income slide?  Are those accurate numbers?

8          A.  Yeah, those are the numbers we were disclosing

9     in our financial statements.  And that relates to --

10          Q.  When I look at 

11              MS. HENNINGER:  I think he was still talking.

12          Q.  I'm sorry.

13          A.  Go ahead and ask me your question.

14          Q.  When I look at $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**, is

15     that all moneys paid for all forms of advertising of all

16     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco products in the year 2009?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

18          A.  What this relates to is advertising for  I

19     mean, it would be R.J. Reynolds advertising, but it would

20     be advertising for cylinder costs, you know, and artwork

21     around some of the new requirements for the FDA, changes

22     to some of our packaging, agency fees; those kinds of

23     things.  This isn't just print.  I mean, if you're

24     thinking these are magazine advertising, that's not what

25     it is.  That is some of it for  we did do somepgNbr=148
149

1     advertising for Camel Snuz, which is, you know, the

2     smokeless products that Reynolds has.

3              So a lot of it is for packaging changes and

4     mockups and things like that in connection with FDA

5     compliance and understanding those kinds of things.

6          Q.  Okay.  Do you have any sense for what

7     percentage of it would fall under that side as opposed

8     to traditional promotion or advertising?

9          A.  No, I don't.

10          Q.  And my question was actually kind of going the

11     other direction.  I thought this was kind of a small

12     number compared to **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**, at least.

13     I'm wondering if there are traditional advertising costs

14     that are not captured  for any reason  by this $

15     figure?

16          A.  What do you mean by "traditional advertising"?

17          Q.  Well, I mean, your standard promotion, whether

18     it be in print, you know, point of sale; any kind of

19     advertising that is not reflected in this number here.

20          A.  Well, the 

21          Q.  Let me go at it this way:  Are there  tell

22     me what advertising, what forms of advertising, are

23     captured in the $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**.

24          A.  Well, advertising in magazines such as Snuz

25     is in there.  And, I mean, if you think about 2008, IpgNbr=149
150

1     mean, we really  I believe we didn't have any print

2     advertising in magazines at all for any cigarettes at

3     R.J. Reynolds.  We had Snuz advertising in 2009.  We may

4     have had a bit of that in 2008, but certainly in 2009.

5     And then there was some money that was spent on Camel

6     Break Free, which is a -- it's a brand, but it didn't

7     identify any products specifically in that advertising in

8     2009.  I think that went out the last quarter of 2009.

9              So I believe this does capture it.  I mean,

10     this is actually an SEC requirement that we put this

11     stuff in our public documents.  And so this -- you know,

12     this would -- in addition to our other operating

13     companies  build up to the numbers that are disclosed

14     in our public filings, our 10-Ks and our -- in our 10-Ks.

15          Q.  If we talk about cigarettes, R.J. Reynolds

16     Tobacco Company as of 2009 doesn't advertise in

17     magazines; is that correct?

18          A.  No.  For cigarettes?

19          Q.  Right.

20          A.  I don't know whether we had anything out in

21     cigarettes in 2009.

22          Q.  Okay.  But if you did, it would be covered by

23     this number, right?

24          A.  Yes, it would.

25          Q.  What about point of purchase advertising, thepgNbr=150
151

1     stuff that you see when you walk into the convenience

2     store, the door openers, you know, and all of that

3     stuff?

4          A.  I believe that's in here as well.  I'll have

5     to double-check that.  I'm not certain about that.  I'm

6     certain that print advertising is in here.

7          Q.  Okay.

8          A.  I'm pretty sure what you have described,

9     Mr. Schultz, is in here.

10          Q.  If it weren't in there, where would it be if

11     you can even answer that?

12              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

13          A.  I don't know where.  It might be in selling

14     expense, but it's not  it shouldn't be there.  It

15     should be in here.  So I just don't have a crystal clear

16     recollection that that's one of the components of this,

17     although I'm pretty sure that it's in here.

18          Q.  How about Internet; does R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

19     Company do any Web-based advertising?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  I don't think we do Web-based advertising.  I

22     mean, we certainly have websites for brands.  I am just

23     not sure that that's in here.

24          Q.  Okay.  Might that be under selling expenses,

25     if it weren't in here?pgNbr=151
152

1          A.  It's more likely under G and A.  Well, I guess

2     broadly it's SG and A.  I mean, it's in that category of

3     selling, general and administrative.  I don't believe

4     that it's in here, in advertising.

5          Q.  Okay.  How about sponsorships?  Does R.J.

6     Reynolds Tobacco Company sponsor events?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

8          A.  Like what?

9          Q.  Well, I don't know.  I'm asking you.  NASCAR,

10     Formula 1, rodeos, baseball games?

11          A.   We don't sponsor any of those things that you

12     suggested.  No.  We don't have any sponsorships, that I'm

13     aware of.  I mean, we got out of the NASCAR business in

14     2003.  We don't do rodeos, Reynolds Tobacco.  We don't

15     do  what were some of the other ones that you

16     mentioned?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Formula 1.

18          Q.  Baseball games.

19          A.  No.  We don't have any sponsorships like that.

20     We are precluded.  We are only allowed one sponsorship

21     under the Master Settlement Agreement, and we've chosen

22     not to do that.

23          Q.  Okay.  So no sponsorships, whatsoever, by R.J.

24     Reynolds Tobacco Company of RJR cigarettes?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.pgNbr=152
153

1          A.  Well, not as R.J. Reynolds cigarettes, not like

2     Camel, you know, like the Camel Classic or the Paul Mall,

3     Promenade or anything like that.  The company sponsors,

4     or the company is a sponsor, or a cosponsor, or a

5     participating sponsor in some community events.  But it

6     provides money and doesn't get any brand recognition

7     other than, you know, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

8     is a gold sponsor.  You know, gold being a level of

9     sponsorship.  So there's no brand recognition.

10          Q.  Okay.  So I 

11          A.  I just want to be clear.

12              We do participate in community events and we

13     are recognized as a company, not as a company that

14     manufactures branded cigarettes.

15          Q.  Would those fall under advertising, or would

16     that fall under some other category?

17          A.  That would probably fall under charitable or

18     community donations, because there is really nothing

19     brand specific that we are getting out of those

20     endeavors.

21          Q.  Now, how about sponsorships?  I've seen, for

22     example, on YouTube where -- I may get the nomenclature

23     wrong.  But my impression was essentially sponsored

24     bands who go on tour, and you have promotions of new

25     products; Camel Crush I have specifically in mind.  IpgNbr=153
154

1     don't know what you call those things in modern

2     advertising speak, but I would consider them promotion

3     and advertising.  How do you characterize them?

4              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  I just want to 

5     if you can give me continuing of objections to things

6     that he can't answer as a CFO.

7              MR. SCHULTZ:  (No response).

8          Q.  I'm trying to figure out what's in the

9     advertising line item and what's not.  I mean, if you

10     don't know something, you don't know it.  Okay.

11          A.  First of all, I don't think we are pushing

12     anything out to YouTube as a company.  I mean, anything

13     that's out there is really coming from other individuals

14     other than us.

15          Q.  Right.

16          A.  With respect to the bands that we may be

17     sponsoring -- "sponsoring" is a bad word since we were

18     just talking about that.  But bands that we've contracted

19     to do at adult-only facilities, that would probably be a

20     part of marketing expense and wouldn't be  I mean, it

21     doesn't fall under the definition of advertising expense.

22     That's not our definition.  That's the SEC's definition

23     of advertising.

24          Q.  Okay.  And, by the way, I didn't mean to

25     suggest that RJR was putting stuff out on YouTube.pgNbr=154
155

1     These are people who have gone, you know, and videotaped

2     these events at bars and what have you.

3          A.  No.  I've seen it as well.  I just wanted to

4     clarify it.

5          Q.  Now, are there similar -- I don't want to use

6     the word "sponsorships" if you don't want to, but I

7     don't know what other word to use.

8              With respect to the bands, if we take that

9     phenomena, that notion of sponsoring a band or promoting

10     a band at these adult-only establishments, are those

11     forms of marketing limited to bands and bars, or do you

12     do that with other entertainment or entertainers, or is

13     it only music bands, to your knowledge?

14              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

15          A.  You know, I'm starting to move down into the

16     marketing side of this stuff.  And I'm not nearly as deep

17     in that as I am on the financial side.  I believe the

18     bands that we contract for to play in these events is

19     adult-only facilities where, you know, it's 18 and older

20     and people are checked and those kinds of things.

21              And I don't believe it really extends anywhere

22     else.  I'm not aware of any other venues that we're in.

23          Q.  Okay.  And those -- the amounts spent on that

24     fall under marketing, that's a different category that

25     appears on the financial reports?pgNbr=155
156

1          A.  It would fall under selling, general and

2     administrative.  Advertising falls in there as well.

3     It's just that it's separately called -- it's required to

4     be separately broken out by the rules of the Securities

5     and Exchange Commission, and they define what advertising

6     means or is, and it doesn't include contracting with

7     bands.

8          Q.  You don't advertise on television, I'm sure,

9     anymore, correct?

10          A.  And haven't since the sixties.

11          Q.  And how about product placement in movies and

12     things of that nature?  None of that?  It's banned by

13     the MSA?

14          A.  I don't know that it was banned by the MSA.  I

15     just know that we don't do that.  I mean, I understand

16     that there was a period of time where it was done, but

17     we don't have -- we, Reynolds Tobacco, doesn't have any

18     arrangements to do it.  That doesn't mean that our

19     products don't show up every once in a while, but they

20     don't show up based on anything that we're doing.

21          Q.  What else might fall under advertising, if you

22     can think of anything?  I'm just kind of going through

23     my mental file of possibilities.

24          A.  Well, like I said, there's agency fees,

25     artwork; those kinds of things, engraving for cylinderspgNbr=156
157

1     that roll cartons, print materials and stuff like that

2     that's in there.  I'm sure that there's some other stuff.

3     I just can't remember what it is right now, Mr. Schultz.

4          Q.  What is the difference between 2009 and 2008,

5     the $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** drop?  What explains

6     that?

7          A.  I don't know.

8          Q.  Now, R.J. Reynolds was advertising in

9     magazines in 2007, wasn't it?

10          A.  Yeah.  I mean, I could speculate that it's not

11     advertising, but I don't know as a matter of fact.

12          Q.  And you have no idea what percentage or

13     amounts can be allocated to sort of packaging, if you

14     will, versus what people on the street would

15     traditionally think that was advertising?

16          A.  Not sitting here right now, no, I do not.

17          Q.  You know, Mr. Adams, if I told the jury, you

18     know what, make R.J. Reynolds pay a $10 million punitive

19     damages verdict.  That's just less than $10 million in

20     advertising that we will see.  If it's that the choice

21     that they tend to make, what would be your response to

22     that?

23              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

24          A.  You can say that.  I'm not sure that we spent

25     $10 million in advertising in 2009, nor do I know exactlypgNbr=157
158

1     what our advertising plans are for this year.  So...

2          Q.  Well, I'm looking at the $**REDACTED

3     CONFIDENTIAL**.  I'm just using the SEC definition.

4     That's advertising out of your reports.

5          A.  Yeah.  Well, we have actually just been through

6     this.  And I said I don't know how much advertising in,

7     you know, print advertising, which is  as you have

8     characterized it -- is the traditional measure of this.

9     I'm not sure how much of that was done in 2009.

10          Q.  Right.  I'm sorry.

11              I didn't mean to limit my question or my

12     suggestion somehow to those sorts of advertising.  I'm

13     saying there's a $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** budget in

14     your report.  Why wouldn't be it fair for a jury to say,

15     you know what, the world is not a worse off place if

16     there's $ **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** less of cigarette

17     advertising next year?

18              What does R.J. Reynolds say to that?

19              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

20          A.  Well, the absence of that advertising --

21     I mean, if that advertising is, for instance, Snuz

22     advertising, which is a product that is  I mean, we

23     believe it's less harmful than combustible cigarettes,

24     actually could negatively impact the awareness on Snuz,

25     which is a product that is potentially  we believe ispgNbr=158
159

1     potentially less harmful to people.

2              So it might keep the word from getting out

3     about something that's less harmful.  I mean, I could say

4     something like that.

5          Q.  Let's take a look, if you would, at the next

6     slide, the research and development expenditures.

7          A.  Yes.

8          Q.  Are there any erroneous numbers here?

9          A.  No.  I believe Mr. Johnson has correctly

10     extracted those from our financial statements.

11          Q.  Tell me, if you know, what is encompassed by

12     research and development expenditures.

13          A.  Science and research around potentially less

14     harmful products, research and development on

15     dissolvables.  I mean, we are constantly looking, or the

16     R and D people I should say are constantly looking at

17     trying to take  as part of our CSR that we talked about

18     earlier, are trying to make these products less harmful

19     and not adding anything.  I mean, you know, tobacco being

20     an agricultural crop, you know, changes year after year

21     depending upon growing conditions, water, temperature and

22     those kinds of things.

23              So the R and D people, you know, assess the

24     taste characteristics, as well as other things that are

25     going on in the tobacco to make sure that there's apgNbr=159
160

1     consistent blend and that there's nothing, you know, from

2     a quality standpoint that enters the product that makes

3     it more harmful.  So those are some of the things that

4     they do.

5          Q.  Do you know how much of this $**REDACTED

6     CONFIDENTIAL** in 2009 is spent on the smoke-free

7     tobacco products versus cigarette R and D?

8          A.  No, I don't.

9          Q.  Take a look at the next slide, management

10     expenses.  And let me ask you, first, if those are

11     accurate numbers?

12          A.  Those are numbers that Mr. Johnson pulled from

13     our report.  So, yes, they are accurate.

14          Q.  Okay.  Can you tell me  let's take 2009 for

15     an example.  What would constitute or comprise that $

16     **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL** in management expenses?

17          A.  Well, the Reynolds Tobacco Company -- I mean,

18     it's a large company, and it generally has departments

19     that cover its various businesses.  It doesn't have a

20     treasury department, and it doesn't have a number of

21     other functions that are required to basically be a

22     freestanding company.  It's part of a larger group.  And

23     so things like access to the external markets  and I'm

24     thinking now treasury and disbursements, some of the RAI

25     services stuff.  Those are the things that are --pgNbr=160
161

1     including general management; I'm sure that there's a

2     portion of my salary that's pushed down to these folks 

3     included in these allocations of management expenses from

4     Reynolds American down to Reynolds Tobacco.

5          Q.  Do you know whether it is only some portion of

6     your salary that's paid, or do all of the RAI executive

7     salaries fall under this management expense?

8          A.  I don't know the answer to whether -- I mean,

9     if all of them are there, I'm sure a portion of some of

10     them are there.

11          Q.  Okay.  Do you know Ms. Ivey's total cash

12     compensation?

13          A.  Not off the top of my head.  I mean, I can

14     look.

15          Q.  At the proxy?

16          A.  Yeah.

17          Q.  Where would you look?

18          A.  (No response).

19          Q.  While you're finding it, Mr. Adams, am I right

20     that the proxy gives the numbers for the top five

21     highest paid people within the RAI umbrella?

22          A.  You are right about that, Mr. Schultz.

23          Q.  Okay.  Can you tell me, please, the total cash

24     compensation for each of those five for the year 2009.

25          A.  Yeah.  Let's start with salary.  Okay.pgNbr=161
162

1              Ms. Ivey's salary was $1,270,000.

2          Q.  Okay.

3          A.  My salary  that we've previously gone over 

4     was $533,882.

5          Q.  Okay.

6          A.  Mr. Delen's salary was $814,600.

7          Q.  Okay.

8          A.  I'm happy to read all of these, but, I mean,

9     I'm just reading numbers off a page you have access to.

10          Q.  Right.

11              I can't look, for example, at the Forbes

12     report and tell what's the total compensation and you

13     can.  And that's the number that I'm trying to get at.

14          A.  Okay.

15          Q.  You all have to  so put these in your proxy

16     that you don't really consider part of your take-home

17     income, as I understand it.  So, in fact, I'm trying

18     to be fair and not double-count these long-term

19     incentives --

20          A.  Okay.

21          Q.   but I would like to get the total cash

22     compensation.

23          A.  That's fair, and I will read it to you.  I

24     mean, just to be fair, we display this information as

25     we are required to do so by the Securities and ExchangepgNbr=162
163

1     Commission.  And so I don't think it's actually very --

2     I mean, it does give a view of it, of total compensation.

3     But it doesn't, as you're saying  cash compensation is

4     a subset of this.

5              So we're not making this up as we go.  We're

6     just following the rules.  We are not trying to obfuscate

7     facts here.

8          Q.  No, I didn't think you were.

9              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.  What page are you on

10     again, Tom?

11              THE WITNESS:  I'm on page 52 of Reynolds

12     American's proxy statement.

13          A.  Okay.  Judy Lambeth.  Her salary is $564,850

14     and Jeff Gentry is $450,418.

15          Q.  Okay.  If you would just like to tell me what

16     other items  I don't have the proxy, by the way, but

17     what other line items that you add to that salary from

18     each -- what you guys call total compensation.  I mean,

19     I can add it up myself.

20          A.  That's okay.

21              I would add in nonequity incentive plan

22     compensation.  And these are amounts that are paid to

23     the officers in the -- oops.  You know what, that's not

24     right.  You know, I'm going back to what I testified to

25     on my salary.  Okay?pgNbr=163
164

1          Q.  Okay.

2          A.  Remember I said that's $983,573 of nonequity

3     incentive compensation?

4          Q.  Uh-hum.

5          A.  Those were payments that were paid in 2010 that

6     related to 2009's performance.

7          Q.  Okay.

8          A.  So by definition, since they were paid in 2010,

9     they are not in my 2009 W-2.  Are you with me on that?

10          Q.  Okay.  Yeah.  You told me your W-2 was about

11     $1.4 million?

12          A.  Right.  And that's because there were numbers

13     that were frankly, you know, that were similar to this

14     that were paid in 2009 that related to performance in

15     2008.

16          Q.  Under that same incentive plan?

17          A.  Yeah.  Right, the same plan, but different

18     measurements for different years.  Okay.  But it's still

19      let's just kind of say it's cash compensation for

20     performance in that particular year.  So, for instance, I

21     would have been paid a salary of $533,882 that I received

22     throughout 2009.  Okay.

23          Q.  Okay.  Right.

24          A.  I was then paid $983,573 for long-term

25     performance, okay, which is over this three-year periodpgNbr=164
165

1     that we talked about earlier, as well as my 2009 bonus.

2     But both of those payments were actually made in 2010

3     after they were reviewed and agreed to by our

4     compensation committee of the board of directors.

5          Q.  So do you consider those part of your 2009

6     total compensation, or do you, by definition, consider

7     them to be 2010?

8          A.  Well, they are in this 2009 compensation table.

9     So they were earned in 2009, but they weren't paid until

10     2010 because they had to be approved, I mean.

11          Q.  Okay.

12          A.  And so those amounts  if I didn't earn any

13     money at all in 2010, $983,573 would show up on my W-2

14     in 2010.

15          Q.  And so it sounds like, given your W-2 for the

16     previous year for 2009, the year before you had made a

17     similar amount from the incentive program?

18          A.  Right.

19          Q.  It was just paid early in 2009?

20          A.  Right, it's the timing of payments.  It's

21     earning them in one year and getting paid in the other,

22     the next.

23          Q.  And in looking at the proxy, does that mean,

24     then, that I can't know specifically what the 2009 total

25     cash compensation was because for each of these fivepgNbr=165
166

1     individuals, I'm getting a 2009 salary, but 2010

2     nonequity incentive plan payouts?

3          A.  Well, I mean, the way that I would look at it

4     is that these amounts were paid.  Okay.  They were just

5     paid, you know, a month or so in arrears.  I mean, they

6     were earned and they were owed.  And they likely would

7     show up as liabilities at the end of  well, they are

8     not likely.  They did show up as liabilities at the end

9     of 2009, but weren't approved for payment until the

10     compensation committee of the board met.

11              So, I mean, those were -- assuming that there

12     were no adjustments made by the Compensation Committee,

13     they were pretty much earned based on our bonus and our

14     long-term incentive goals that were out there.  Now,

15     that's different from the change in the pension values

16     because there's really no cash there that goes outside

17     the company.  And the stock awards are awards that were

18     granted, but that won't be earned for three years out.

19              So I would actually characterize them as cash

20     compensation earned in 2009, some of which was received

21     in 2009, and some of which was received shortly after

22     year end.

23          Q.  Okay.  And in order to get that figure for

24     each of you, I take it, from the proxy, you would add up

25     your salary, your nonequity incentive plan compensationpgNbr=166
167

1     and your bonus?

2          A.  The bonus is included in the nonequity

3     compensation.  If you look at footnote No. 7,

4     Mr. Schultz, it talks about 2009 annual incentives and

5     then performance.  And there are two components in there.

6     And those two added together -- in my case  add up to

7     the 983.  And it's broken out separately for each of

8     those five officers, those other four officers that

9     you asked about.

10          Q.  And how about your bonus?  What was your

11     specific bonus amount?

12          A.  My bonus for 2009 was $550,000.

13          Q.  Okay.  Let's go ahead and attach a copy of the

14     proxy, or did you only bring your copy?

15          A.  I just brought my copy, but I'm happy to get

16     one to the court reporter.  Well, you know, you can have

17     this one.  I'll get another one.

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Is that written on it?

19              THE WITNESS:  I don't think so.

20          A.  I have actually made a couple of notes on this,

21     not germane to this deposition that I will get you.  I'll

22     get a copy to Ms. Henninger, and then she can provide it

23     to the court reporter.

24              MS. HENNINGER:  Does that work?

25              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  We will mark that aspgNbr=167
168

1     No. 6.  And let's mark as No. 7 the list of cases that

2     I was provided that you brought with you this morning.

3              MS. HENNINGER:  Okay.

4               (Exhibits 6 and 7 were marked for

5     identification).

6              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  This is Rafael.  Do you

7     have any idea how much longer you're going?

8              MR. SCHULTZ:  I've got  I don't know  20

9     minutes, maybe.

10              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Okay.  All right.

11              MS. HENNINGER:  Do you need a comfort break?

12     Yeah.  And the court reporter is nodding to that.  Can

13     we take a quick restroom break?

14              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  That's fine.

15              MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah.  Let's try to make it as

16     quick as we can.  I'm going to try to get done by

17     2 o'clock my time, if I can possibly do it.

18               (Recess taken).

19     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

20          Q.  Let me ask you, Mr. Adams to look at  No. 7,

21     I guess.  It's your list of cases.

22              MS. HENNINGER:  Hold on.  He has to get it.

23          A.  Okay.

24          Q.  Do you have any  I think you told me that

25     you testified in trial three times or four times.  DopgNbr=168
169

1     you recall -- there's only one listed here, because this

2     goes back five years.  I take it that, first of all, to

3     mean that the couple or three times that you testified

4     was before June of 2005; is that right?

5          A.  Yes.  That's correct.

6          Q.  And do you recall the names of any of those

7     trials?

8          A.  I testified  yes, I do recall the names of

9     one, maybe two.  The first trial was the Whiteley trial

10     in 2000, I believe.  And that was in San Francisco.

11          Q.  Okay.

12          A.  And then the next one was Burton in Kansas

13     City, and that may have been it, and this Lincoln Smith

14     case.  I'm trying to think if there was another case.

15     I've given a number of depositions, but I think those are

16     the only cases where I actually had to take the stand to

17     testify.

18          Q.  In any of those cases, or in any of the cases

19     on the list, have you written, to your recollection, an

20     actual report that you signed and handed over to the

21     lawyers?

22          A.  You mean like an affidavit?

23          Q.  Right, for filing in court.

24          A.  I'm sure I did.

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Matt, I don't mean topgNbr=169
170

1     interrupt you, but I think he doesn't understand what

2     you're talking about.

3              MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  I don't mean  to

4     clarify:  I don't mean an internal report that you may

5     have shared with lawyers for the company.  I mean,

6     something that  at least to your understanding 

7     would have constituted a formal report that's publicly

8     filed.

9              MS. HENNINGER:  I think he's talking about

10     things like Mr. Johnson did, if that helps.

11          A.  You know, that's -- I don't think I did that in

12     Lincoln Smith.  And I don't have a recollection of doing

13     that in Whiteley, nor  and I actually don't remember

14     too much about the Burton trial.  I mean, that was more

15     than five years ago, and I just don't remember.  I mean,

16     I'm not saying that I didn't do it.  I just don't

17     remember doing it.

18          Q.  Right.

19              One good candidate would be Schwab because

20     that was in federal court, and federal court has a

21     requirement for filing reports by experts.  Do you know

22     whether you were named as an expert in Schwab?

23          A.  I don't know that.  I mean, I don't know

24     whether I was or I wasn't.

25          Q.  Okay.  In each of these cases  and justpgNbr=170
171

1     break it out however it makes sense to you in explaining

2     or responding.  But in each of these cases, were you

3     testifying, generally speaking, to the same subject

4     matters to which you will be testifying in the Walden

5     case?

6          A.  I believe in the City of St. Louis I was.

7     In the IPIC case in West Virginia, pretty much again

8     it was financial testimony, those kinds of things,

9     describing the company's financials.  Yes.  I actually

10     don't remember my deposition from Schwab.  That was, you

11     know, five years ago.  And I don't remember exactly what

12     transferred, and in Lincoln Smith I had talked about the

13     company's financial statements in trial.

14          Q.  Let me ask you this way:  Have you ever been

15     involved in a smoking and health case -- that you can

16     recall sitting here -- in which you were not called to

17     testify regarding the company's financials?

18              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.  Go ahead.

19          A.  Not an individual and smoking health case.

20          Q.  Okay.  How about, then, a DOJ case, for

21     example.  Did you testify, or were you called upon to

22     testify, in a DOJ case in any capacity?

23          A.  No, I wasn't.

24          Q.  Were there smoking and health cases that were

25     not individual cases  it sounded like you were makingpgNbr=171
172

1     a distinction there between individual cases and perhaps

2     some other types of cases.

3          A.  I did testify in the Turner case, Turner Nee

4     Wallace, which is the Lights Class Action in Illinois

5     about organization structure, which is basically about

6     my understanding of the Reynolds organization and the

7     Reynolds Tobacco organization, historically.

8              So I was just interpreting organization charts

9     over a period of years.  So that would be nonfinancial,

10     and I think there was a separate deposition on that.  I

11     don't remember when that was.

12          Q.  All right.  And would that be the only one

13     fitting that description?

14          A.  Yes, it would be.

15          Q.  That actually prompted a question that I had.

16     This refers to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  I'm

17     looking at financials and subsidiaries.  I think you've

18     already told me that there are no subsidiaries that are

19     operating companies as such; is that correct?

20          A.  No, that's not correct.  I mean, this includes

21     the operations of the Puerto Rico subsidiary.  So they

22     are included in here.

23          Q.  Okay.  I see that now.  In GPI or formerly

24     GPI?

25          A.  Yes, that's Global Products, Incorporated.pgNbr=172
173

1     They are included in 2009, but not in 2008 and 2007.

2          Q.  So I take it that RJRT Puerto Rico contributed

3     to the bottom line of RJRT as reported in this financial

4     statement, the audited financial?

5          A.  Yes, it does.

6          Q.  Okay.  And how about GPI?

7          A.  It did in 2009; in 2008 and 2007 it was

8     separately reported.  It was a separate company.  It was

9     not included in Reynolds Tobacco.  And so what would have

10     been included in Reynolds Tobacco would have been the

11     profit that Reynolds Tobacco made on the sale of

12     products, if you will, to GPI.

13              So said differently:  Reynolds produced the

14     cigarettes.  They marked them up.  They sold them to GPI,

15     and GPI sold them on.  So that intercompany profits would

16     have been included in the Reynolds information.

17              MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  By taking a look at 

18     let's go ahead and attach as Exhibit 8 the Continuing

19     Commitment Corporate Responsibility Report.

20              THE WITNESS:  Okay.

21               (Exhibit 8 was marked for identification).

22          Q.  I have just a couple of questions.

23              First of all, have you ever testified on

24     company financials when you did not also testify about

25     the corporate responsibility report pgNbr=173
174

1          A.  Yes.

2          Q.   or is that routinely a feature of your

3     testimony?

4          A.  I mean, in 2000 when I testified in Whiteley,

5     it was solely related to financials.  That was actually

6     before we published the Corporate Social Responsibility

7     Report.  And I'm not sure in Burton that it wasn't solely

8     related to financial information.  And, as I sit here and

9     think about that, I think it was solely financial.  And

10     that probably predated these CSR reports.

11          Q.  And was the first CSR report in 2004?

12          A.  I believe it was probably in 2005.  The

13     companies merged -- Reynolds and Brown & Williamson

14     merged in the summer of 2004.  So it was either published

15      you know, the early part of that was published either

16     in 2005 or later that year.

17          Q.  And how many iterations have there been since

18     2005 of the CSR?

19          A.  Well, If I'm right about 2005, I think there's

20     been an annual iteration.  And it may be that the thing

21     first came out in 2006.  And then there's been updates

22     each year, I mean, as we have expanded things like

23     stakeholder dialog and those kinds of things.

24          Q.  Are you aware -- as we sit here -- of any sort

25     of top-line differences between the 2010 report thatpgNbr=174
175

1     just came out last week and the 2009 or 2008, whatever

2     is the most recent iteration before the 2010?

3          A.  I think the 2010 report features, you know,

4     some of the stuff that I mentioned earlier about in

5     Puerto Rico, and that they have launched this youth

6     tobacco program there.  So, I mean, that's a difference,

7     because I think that only occurred in 2009.  The SAMHSA

8     I think was 2008.  I just have to go through here and

9     pick things out.

10              I mean, there was some stuff around

11     environmental sustainability that we featured when we

12     tore some our warehouses down.  They were recycling all

13     of those things.  That occurred in 2009.  So that's

14     different.  I haven't gone through and marked the

15     differences.  I think we're clearly  I mean, some of

16     the things that we've done we're reiterating, but there's

17     also new information that's in here.

18              And I think it's generally appropriately marked

19     at some point in 2009, or there is a date that's

20     associated with the new information.

21          Q.  Are all of the earlier iterations available,

22     publicly available, on your website, to your knowledge?

23          A.  I don't know the answer to that.  I would guess

24     that -- I don't know whether we archived them or whether

25     they are, you know, basically replaced by the currentpgNbr=175
176

1     view.  I just don't know that.

2          Q.  One question about the substance of the

3     report.  You know, I see now page 8.  There's a quote by

4     Mark Holton and he's described as "R.J. Reynolds'

5     General Counsel who oversees the company's youth tobacco

6     prevention efforts."

7              First of all, that's the same Mark Holton, I

8     take it, who reported on the Engle Progeny cases at the

9     meeting last week?

10              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

11          A.  The same person, yes.

12          Q.  And he is the -- to your understanding,

13     Mr. Holton, your General Counsel, oversees the company's

14     youth tobacco prevention efforts?

15          A.  Well, I think so, yes.  Mark broadly is

16     responsible for MSA compliance, and youth tobacco

17     prevention is also a component of the MSA.

18          Q.  Right.

19              So is it fair to say that between  is he

20     with RAI or R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

21          A.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

22          Q.  So Mark Holton, in your estimation, would be

23     the person at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company who's most

24     knowledgeable about RJRT's youth tobacco prevention

25     efforts?pgNbr=176
177

1              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

2          A.  I don't know that he is most knowledgeable.  He

3     is knowledgeable.  I mean, there are other individuals

4     that work with that as well.

5          Q.  Who would come to mind to you as somebody with

6     a great deal of knowledge on that?

7          A.  Well, actually, a couple of the fellows that

8     are pictured here, Steve Strawsburg and Alan Coldwell.

9     I mean, they are the ones who are standing up and talking

10     to this group in the picture on page 8.

11          Q.  What are their positions within the company?

12          A.  Steve's position is vice president for

13     corporate social responsibility and, actually, I don't

14     know what Alan's title is, but he works with Steve.

15          Q.  All right.  I want to walk through the

16     financials, and this will be the last thing I do.  I

17     have a handful probably, you know, of fairly relatively

18     dumb questions, but I'm sure you're accustomed to those

19     by now.  I have just a few more things.

20          A.  Which financials are we going through now?

21          Q.  I'm looking at the audited financials,

22     December 31st, 2009 and 2008.

23          A.  Which company?  Do you mean R.J. Reynolds

24     Tobacco?

25          Q.  Right.pgNbr=177
178

1          A.  Okay.

2          Q.  The first question I have is at **REDACTED

3     CONFIDENTIAL** the 2009 net sales of roughly **REDACTED

4     CONFIDENTIAL**.

5          A.  Yes.

6          Q.  What percentage  if you can break that down

7     for me, if you can, the percentage of those sales that

8     is represented by conventional  sales of conventional

9     tobacco-burning cigarettes?

10          A.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

11              It's more fully described in our related

12     parties footnote.  It's a contract manufacturing

13     agreement that we have with B.A.T. that was part of the

14     merger agreement in 2004.

15          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

16          A.  I believe so.  And those are the numbers that

17     Mr. Johnson picked earlier.  I mean, those are the top 

18     those are the numbers that he's referenced in his report,

19     whatever exhibit it was.

20          Q.  And can you tell me in descending order what

21     the other five percent would be attributable to?  I

22     assume there's moist, smokeless, your smoke-free

23     tobaccos and nontraditional cigarettes like Eclipse?

24          A.  Actually, I can't tell you that sitting here.

25     The moist is not sold by Reynolds Tobacco.  So it's notpgNbr=178
179

1     included in there.

2          Q.  All right.

3          A.  There would be some -- there would likely be

4     some Eclipse in there, but it's a pretty small number

5     because we don't sell very many of them.  There is  I

6     believe there's some Snuz revenue in there.  I just can't

7     dimensionalize what that is.  I just don't  I wouldn't

8     even want to speculate, but it's small, I believe.

9          Q.  Okay.  Is there anything else in there that

10     would constitute the roughly five percent besides

11     Eclipse and Snuz?

12          A.  No, not in 2009 because we really didn't launch

13     dissolvables until 2010.

14          Q.  And they are  at this point  less than one

15     percent for the quarter, let's say?

16          A.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are.  Yes.

17          Q.  I'm sorry.  I'm walking through this, because

18     we have actually discussed a whole lot of this stuff

19     that I was going to ask you about as I walk through the

20     reports.  So bear with me, please.

21          A.  Sure.

22          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

23              Can you describe for me what that is

24     describing?

25              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection, but go ahead.pgNbr=179
180

1          A.  Well, it's describing  I mean, it's

2     describing exactly what you said.  I mean, there is a

3     note from RAI that for -- where RJRT has advanced moneys,

4     and RAI has agreed to pay them back in semiannual

5     installments through 2024 or earlier on demand.  So...

6          Q.  Why do that by way of an unsecured note as

7     opposed to just altering dividends, for example?

8          A.  Because dividends are permanent in nature.  I

9     mean, once you sent dividends, then to push money back

10     down would require recapitalization of the company.  And

11     so using intercompany notes provides the company a bit

12     more flexibility, I believe.

13          Q.  Where does RAI get the money to pay back the

14     $**REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**?

15              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

16          A.  Well, those are balances at two points in time;

17     they are not additive.

18          Q.  Oh, I see.

19          A.  I mean, it probably gets its money from either

20     borrowings at the bank, it could, or it could get them

21     from the other operating companies.

22          Q.  Is that, to your understanding, what will

23     happen; the money will be paid back to RJRT from either

24     a loan or from other operating companies?

25          A.  You know, you're asking me to speculate what'spgNbr=180
181

1     going to happen, you know, 14 years into the future.  And

2     I can't say that we've developed financial plans that

3     extend out that far.

4          Q.  Right.

5              **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

6          A.  Well, I mean, it could be those things that

7     you just described and that I described, borrowings from

8     outside sources, or borrowings or cash from subsidiaries

9     from other operating companies.

10          Q.  Do you know what the loan was made for, the

11     purpose of the loan?

12          A.  No, I do not.

13          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

14              First of all, what is a revolving demand note?

15          A.  It means that it can move up and down over

16     time.  That's what my understanding is of a revolver.

17     It's a revolving credit facility.

18          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**. 19

20          Q.  Do you know where the money will come from to

21     pay that back by March 25th, 2013?

22          A.  I think the source of those funds would be the

23     same source of funds for the unsecured note that existed

24     at the end of the year.  So it's borrowings from outside

25     banks perhaps or, you know, sources from other operatingpgNbr=181
182

1     companies.

2          Q.  And so I understand it, there's --

3          A.  Excuse me.  It's also entirely possible that

4     Reynolds Tobacco could dividend money up, and then we

5     can basically use those moneys to pay down the note.

6          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

7          A.  Well, I don't know that it will be paid.  It's

8     payable on demand no later than the maturity date.  But,

9     I mean, I suppose we could always renegotiate that rate

10     with that, but not only the rate but the date with RJRT.

11          Q.  What does RAI do with all of that money?

12          A.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

13              I mean, what does RAI do with it?  They pay

14     dividends.  They pay down debt.  They pay interest

15     expense on debt.  They make pension plans of the order of

16     magnitude of $300 million a year.  I mean, there's a big

17     demand on cash at RAI to conduct its corporate matters.

18     And those matters actually benefit the operating

19     companies in the case of Reynolds Tobacco and its

20     employees.

21              In the case of Reynolds Tobacco, Reynolds

22     American is making the pension contribution that largely

23     benefits RAI, RJRT's employees and actually a broader

24     group is the retirees; those people that have already

25     retired from the company; and also the debt outstandingpgNbr=182
183

1     actually finances that RAI has that enables Reynolds to

2     finance its ongoing operations.

3          Q.  Let me ask you to look at the next page.

4     There is a list of loans.  I would call them loans.  I'm

5     not sure if that's the right term to use or not.

6              **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

7          Q.  Okay.  I mean, I honestly don't know the

8     difference between a credit facility and a line of

9     credit.  If the difference doesn't matter to regular

10     folks, then it doesn't matter to me.

11          A.  Lines of credit are generally  I mean,

12     I believe lines of credit are generally extended to

13     individuals and revolving credit facilities actually

14     are more commercial in nature.

15          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

16          A.  Well, sometime ago Reynolds Tobacco had a joint

17     venture with Gallaher, and that joint venture was

18     dissolved, I believe, in 2008.  The moneys that  the

19     cash that was received as a result of that dissolution

20     that we have  it's stayed overseas.  It stayed in those

21     overseas bank accounts, because when we bring it back we

22     will have to pay income taxes on it, U.S. income taxes.

23              And so my guess is this allows a temporary

24     loaning of those funds back and forth without having to

25     repatriate it on a permanent basis those moneys andpgNbr=183
184

1     having to pay the cash.  I don't know that anything is

2     drawn on this.  I think it's just, you know, arrangements

3     where cash happens to be sitting.

4          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

5              Can you break that down into English for me,

6     and tell me what that is describing.

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

8              THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  I'm sorry.

9              MS. HENNINGER:  It's in English.

10          A.  Yeah.  This is the plain English that the SEC

11     talks about.

12              **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

13              And what it's done is:  Each of the operating

14     companies has guaranteed those payments by entering this

15     guarantee agreement, and they are not all  and the

16     reason it's so  the wording is so complicated.  It's

17     not all of them are guaranteeing each of the individual

18     notes.  Like, for instance, some of the notes that are

19     involved here were entered into before the American Snuff

20     Company was acquired in 2006.  So they are not on the

21     notes; or if they had been added to the notes, they are

22     on there as an amendment.

23              So this just basically says that there's an

24     obligation on these operating companies that if RAI

25     defaults, that it becomes the obligations and thepgNbr=184
185

1     guarantees of the operating companies to satisfy those

2     notes.

3          Q.  Okay.  So it's kind of like having a cosigner

4     on a loan?

5          A.  Yeah, it's actually a good way to put it.  I

6     probably should have said that from the get-go.

7          Q.  Okay.  That's good enough.

8              **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

9              Now, as we sit here today, is that still an

10     accurate statement?  There are no other liabilities for

11     pending smoking and health tobacco litigation recorded

12     in RJR's balance sheet?

13              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

14          A.  Yes, I believe that's true.  And, to be fair,

15     I mean, I really shouldn't speak for anything that

16     extends beyond the first quarter; I mean, just because

17     of providing, you know, material information.

18          Q.  Right.

19          A.  But I don't believe that there has been

20     anything subsequent to that information which was

21     released in our "Q."

22          Q.  **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

23          A.  "Material" has a financial meaning, but I can't

24     quantify it for you.  A material event is an event that

25     may change -- that would change an investor's decisionpgNbr=185
186

1     on the financial matters for the company.  So said

2     differently:  If you were to want to invest money in

3     Reynolds  and I'm going to say Reynolds Tobacco, but

4     let's just -- you can use Reynolds American.  What type

5     of an event would change  would cause you to change

6     your mind.

7              So is it, you know, a $50 million loss that we

8     would sustain as a result of a fire or an earthquake?

9     I mean, is that material?  And, again, I mean, I can't

10     answer that for you.  I mean, it's a broad question that

11     goes to all investors.  So it's more of a relative state

12     of mind of what "materiality" means.

13          Q.  Okay.

14          A.  I mean, it's clearly larger than a dollar, but

15     then to dimensionalize it -- I mean, some of this stuff

16     could be nonfinancial as well.

17          Q.  How about difficulties obtaining bonding for a

18     stay of execution of judgment on appeal?  How does that

19     operate to have a potentially material adverse effect

20     on RJR?

21          A.  Well, if you can't obtain bonding for a

22     material event, then  actually, one of the best cases

23      and I'm sorry about this Philip Morris.  But the Price

24     Miles case in Illinois, when there was a judgment that

25     was awarded against Philip Morris in that case where IpgNbr=186
187

1     think for some $10 billion, Philip Morris indicated that

2     it may be incapable of bonding that, as I recall, and

3     that they may have to seek protection from that

4     enforcement, hence, or bankruptcy.

5              None of that happened because all of those

6     things got set aside, but there's not a bonding cap in

7     the State of Illinois.  So the inability to --

8          Q.  Is the 

9          A.  I'm sorry?

10              MS. HENNINGER:  He's still finishing.

11          Q.  Go ahead.

12          A.  So I think, you know, the inability to bond

13     an appeal could result in an adverse consequence to the

14     company.  I'm not saying just Illinois.  I mean, you

15     know, almost anywhere.

16          Q.  Is that why R.J. Reynolds and the other

17     defendants in the Engle cases pushed for the bond cap

18     in Florida?  Was that the concern driving that?

19              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

20              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Objection to form.

21          A.  I'm not sure what drove that.  I don't have

22     knowledge of that.

23          Q.  So you have no knowledge of whether R.J.

24     Reynolds 

25          A.  I'm aware of pgNbr=187
188

1          Q.  You have no knowledge of  let me finish my

2     question, please.

3          A.  Uh-hum.

4          Q.  You have no knowledge of whether R.J. Reynolds

5     lobbied for the appeal bond cap in the State of Florida?

6              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

7          A.  I understand that  well, actually, I should

8     say that  I mean, I heard that we did.  But I don't

9     have any direct knowledge of that.

10          Q.  Okay.  You were not consulted in any way over

11     the need for an appeal bond cap, for the move for an

12     appeal bond cap that was made?

13          A.  I would always advocate for an appeal bond cap.

14     But I don't recall specifically being consulted in this

15     particular circumstance.

16          Q.  If R.J. Reynolds doesn't have that appeal bond

17     cap, does it have concerns, then, that it would be able

18     to meet the obligations of the judgments that are coming

19     due if they are upheld?

20              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

21          A.  Well, you, yourself, said that, you know, we've

22     got 120 -- what was your number -- $126 million in

23     compensatories and punitive damages thus far.  Yeah.  I

24     mean, I would be concerned over a period of time if we

25     continue on this pace that we couldn't bond that typepgNbr=188
189

1     of bond, if it weren't for the appeal bond cap.

2          Q.  Right, and that's kind of my point.

3              It's $149 million in punitive damages, and

4     those are gross verdicts really out of a handful cases.

5     I guess my question is directed to this:  If you have

6     concerns about your ability to bond the judgment, how

7     are you going to pay them?

8              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

9          A.  That's a good question.  Maybe I will use that,

10     Mr. Schultz.  You know, I don't know how we would do that

11     because we have only tried, you know, relatively

12     speaking, a handful of cases versus the eight to 9,000

13     that are going forward.  So, clearly, if this is the path

14     that we're on, and all those things, you know, are

15     upheld, then we have some serious concerns.

16          Q.  Right.

17              And the industry's position publicly has been

18     that ya'll are never going to settle any of these cases,

19     and that ya'll will fight every one of them.  Is that

20     RJR's position as well?

21              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

22          A.  I don't know that we said that publicly.

23          Q.  Murray Garnick had said that.

24          A.  Who is that?

25          Q.  Philip Morris.pgNbr=189
190

1              And I'm asking you if you share that position?

2          A.  I think I said from the beginning that we will

3     defend cases.

4              MR. ALVAREZ-CRUZ:  Objection to the form of

5     the question.  I'm sorry.

6          Q.  Let me get you to look at page 43.

7              **REDACTED CONFIDENTIAL**

8          A.  Because they require payments.  I described

9     this circumstance or this, yeah, circumstance or

10     construct earlier.  We have agreed to make this  the

11     original, as the parlance is used in the MSA, Philip

12     Morris, Reynolds and now Brown & Williamson and Lorillard

13     have all agreed to make payments to these four settling

14     states.  And, to my knowledge, the non  there are no

15     nonparticipating manufactures there.

16              And the difference between what we're paying

17     and what they are paying, which is nothing, provides them

18     a competitive advantage in terms of pricing in the

19     marketplace.  And so our shipments have suffered as a

20     result of them being able to sell cigarettes less

21     expensively than us.

22              MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's it, Mr. Adams.

23     Let me take two seconds here and look over my notes, but

24     I think I'm done.

25              THE WITNESS:  Okay.pgNbr=190
191

1               (Short pause).

2     BY MR. SCHULTZ:

3          Q.  I have a couple of kind of wrap-up questions.

4              To your knowledge, are you going to testify in

5     Izzarelli, or any other cases pending outside of Florida

6     right now?

7              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

8          A.  If I am asked to do so.

9          Q.  My question is:  Have you been asked to do so?

10              THE WITNESS:  I don't think I've been noticed

11     or anything.

12              MS. HENNINGER:  I can't answer it for you.

13          A.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't have a

14     recollection of being asked.  And I generally remember

15     when I'm being asked to do something like this.

16          Q.  Well, it doesn't show up on your list of

17     depositions either, the case in Connecticut right now?

18          A.  Right.  No.  I'm familiar with it, but I just

19     haven't participated in it to this point.

20          Q.  All right.  How about other Engle Progeny

21     cases?  Are you aware of whether you have been

22     designated in any other Engle Progeny cases to testify?

23          A.  I don't know of any at this point.

24          Q.  How about details about Mr. Walden?  Are there

25     any details about Mr. Walden, or his family, that arepgNbr=191
192

1     relevant or important in any way to your opinions?

2          A.  I actually don't know much about him.  I

3     haven't been briefed on that.

4          Q.  Okay.  And I presume that you don't know much

5     about him, because you really don't have to offer the

6     testimony you're offering, right?

7          A.  Yeah.  I mean, I was limited largely to the

8     financial stuff and talking to the financial information

9     and to the CSR.  And I don't know which of the company's

10     brands Mr. Walden smoked, or what his smoking history

11     was.

12          Q.  Okay.  Do you have any military experience?

13          A.  As in "service"?

14          Q.  Correct.

15          A.  No.  I have not been in the military.

16          Q.  Have you ever been convicted of a crime?

17          A.  No.

18          Q.  Have you ever been involved in any personal

19     litigation, sued someone individually or been sued in

20     your individual capacity?

21          A.  I have not sued anyone.  A long time ago when

22     I was at Deloitte, there was an action brought against

23     Deloitte as a partner there that included me.  So yes.

24          Q.  Did it include you only by virtue of your

25     partnership status, or did the substantive allegationspgNbr=192
193

1     of the lawsuit in some way encompass actions or acts

2     undertaken by you?

3              MS. HENNINGER:  Objection.

4          A.  I was the partner or one of the partners on the

5     engagement, and we were sued for negligence, I believe.

6          Q.  Okay.  How did that come out?

7          A.  In our favor, in Deloitte's favor.

8          Q.  Okay.  Is that the only time that you have

9     ever been named in a lawsuit, to your recollection?

10          A.  Yes.

11              MR. SCHULTZ:  That's all I have.  Thank you.

12              THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Thank you.

13              MS. HENNINGER:  I have no questions.  Just so

14     the record is clear:  He will read and sign.

15              THE REPORTER:  Okay.  Thank you very much.

16              MS. HENNINGER:  And just also, you know, to

17     the extent there's a protective order in this case that

18     covers some of the financial information that Reynolds

19     has produced.  And we have  pursuant to the terms of

20     the confidentiality agreement or the protective order 

21     I believe 15 days in order to designate portions of the

22     transcript as being confidential or highly confidential

23     and marked under seal or, you know, filed under seal.

24     So for now we are just reserving our right to do that.

25              THE REPORTER:  Okay.pgNbr=193
194

1              MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, and I did not attach the

2     financial statement for that reason.  Obviously, we

3     reserve the right to challenge any designations, but the

4     protective order, confidentiality order, will govern all

5     of that.  Okay.

6              THE REPORTER:  All right.  Mr. Schultz, do you

7     need a rough ASCII of the transcript tomorrow?

8              MR. SCHULTZ:  No, I'm fine with regular

9     turnaround time.

10              THE REPORTER:  Okay.  Thank you.

11              MR. CRUZ-ALVAREZ:  This is Rafael.  I don't

12     need a copy or anything.  We get our materials from RJR

13     on this.

14              THE REPORTER:  Okay.  Thank you.

15              Ms. Henninger, so only you get the rough

16     tomorrow?

17              MS. HENNINGER:  Yeah.  That's right.

18              THE REPORTER:  Okay.  Thank you.
